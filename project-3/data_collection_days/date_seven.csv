"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",SyCams,5511,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/es2cek/rdating_is_not_the_place_to_soapbox/,1579646134.0,0.98
"Fiancé isn’t sexually adventurous with me like she was her ex Hello all I just want to get some advice on how to handle this. My fiancé and I are really close and are best friends. We know everything about each other, including sexual history. She said that she used to be very adventurous with her ex’s, they did it in cars, on the beach, etc. Last December she promised me that we would have sex on the beach (isolated beach in the Caribbean). She said that she wanted to go to a new place to make it special for us and not with her exs. I never had any sexual experiences like this (everything vanilla). Then, once December came she would make constant excuses about not being able to do it. So I brushed it off and said ok, we can do it in July since we were going back.

July was also the month that I was going to propose. So I thought she would plan it for us after I proposed. So I planned the perfect engagement surprise and was expecting her to make up her promise to me. I saw plenty of opportunities for us to sneak off away from her family but she didn’t want to do it. It was the last day before we had to come back to the states and I was very upset about it. She said “oh, we can do it in the car to get it over with.” Meanwhile her parents were waiting for us at her house. I told her I wanted it to be something special like she promised. 

I’m just curious if I’m overreacting to this? It’s very hard to get her to fulfill my sexual needs. She knows what I like but seldom thinks about pleasing me (BJ, 69, whatever). She doesn’t talk dirty to me or anything. It’s just too plain and boring.",RevolutionaryAge2239,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ktb4f/fiancé_isnt_sexually_adventurous_with_me_like_she/,1691434017.0,0.88

"Girl who rejected me in 2017 approached me randomly. Why? I asked a girl out in college back in 2017, she softly rejected me. I moved on.

I saw her again in 2021 and 2022 as we worked in the same building a few times a month. We never spoke or anything. Recently I started seeing her around after not seeing her for a year. She randomly followed me to my office one time to ask for something (job related) that she didn’t actually need. As she came into to the room following me, she paused and looked at me in the eye and said I think I’ve seen you before, you look familiar. I played it dumb, and said oh yeah where. Then she brings up college, classes, etc. I kept playing dumb and was like oh yeah probably there, it sounds like we were in the same major. Then she just went quiet and I gave her stuff that she asked for. 

A week later, out of curiosity I followed her on Instagram. She followed back right away. It’s funny cause in 2017, she never followed me back lol. I found out that at least since the day I asked her for her number in 2017, she has not had a bf, despite being an attractive girl. Now shes 28 and still single.

"Men are interested in me (F30) at the beginning, they find me exciting and cool. But then after getting to know me, their interest completely dies. I'm 30 and I've never been able to maintain a romantic relationship beyond 2-3 months 
 Anyone else in the same situation? Most of my female friends are soon married and some have children. Most of my co workers have partners. My siblings have a significant other. Im the only one in my life that has never been able to maintain a romantic relationship for more than 2-3 months. 

People always ask me why I'm single, why I'm not able to find a partner. And sometimes I lie and say I haven't found someone, but the truth is that men love the idea of me in the beginning and find me exciting but that interest dies down completely after a couple of months. 

Its been constant and no matter what type of guy I'm dating and no matter what approach/strategy I'm using. I've dated co workers, friends, guys from college etc. Like how people meet naturally. And it has never worked out. In the meantime, people close to me have dated in the same situations and they've found their person without problems. I've been told by people that I'm cute and most guys I've dated have been very attracted to me so I'm quite sure its not my looks.

"Do men really not care about women finishing while having sex? So I was talking to 2 of my male friends (I am male as well) we are all 20 years old, both currently have girlfriends. We somehow got on the topic of sex and they told me ""when I cum sex is over"". Now I have read about that a ton but I always thought that was some kind of joke or just a small percentage of men who think like that. But now with two hits so close to home I kinda feel like its not as uncommon as I thought? I am still a virgin so I can't speak from experience, but from what I have heard its hard or even impossible for some women to cum from penetration alone, and even if, I don't think I would be able to last long enough. So my ""game plan"" for that would be cunnilingus / fingering to get her to cum first, then maybe go in after that, because at that point its probably going to be just one thrust haha.  
  
  
  
Anyhow, do most men really just not care about their partner?

"I got STD after my first time To give context: I (25F) dating my bf (24M) is in a current relationship we're new and very intimate. It's my first time to do sex and I'm his first time as well. I'm currently on medication since my doctors found out I'm sick with UTI and my urine have this bacteria. They never really gave me anything diagnosis or diagnosed but told me I have UTI so I was given medicine for both UTI and STD (some friends who knows medical stuff told me it was mild) I'm currently taking my meds and on my way to my 2nd week (need 14 days of medication) I'm also currently taking pills before but I'm now on my 2nd day of rest for 7 days from pills (as advice by my OB).

So my question is how did I get STD from first time? I have no educational background for sex education given that my country doesn't really talk much about it (traditional country) so yeah. I still going maybe when I finished my medication to another clinic to check if I still have std and have him check as well because I'm the only girl he's been with and I got this std.

"Am I (32F) close minded for not wanting to go on date with a man with a teenage daughter? I hope I am not posting in the wrong sub but here we go. 

Family friends want to set me up (32F) with a man (35M). I am usually openminded to meeting people (don't knock it before you try it) but there are 2 factors which makes me not to want to consider a first date.  This is the main factor: He has a 15 year old daughter that lives with him.  She has a mother and there is no ex-drama that I know of, but it just makes me feel weird that he has such a grown daughter and that he has custody of her.  Family friend is saying that I should be happy that his daughter is grown because most men in the dating pool will have small kids requring way more attention. 

The other factor is that he lives an hour away without traffic. For an urban location like mine, that's kind of far. An hour is nothing if I met someone organically and fell in love, but to set up myself up for this, seems meh. 

If this was a date via an app, I would have likely swiped left. But I am in bind since we are being set up. If I don't go, the family friend will be disapponted, If I go and give the date a lackluster effort, that may be disrepectful. What do you all think?

TLDR: Should I (32F, childfree) agree to a family friend setting me up with a man who has custody of a teenager?

"It really is just luck I happen to be friends with an attractive guy, 6'3, makes six figures, good-looking etc... he's been with dozens of women, but he's told me he failed to sleep with 90% of women he approached. I found that a bit astonishing. He obviously still has a much higher success rate than most, but still, even for him 1 out of 10 chance is just luck. 

I like to think I'm a rather average guy, 5'10, reasonably fit, middle-class, not rich or poor, socially competent, but not super-charismatic. I'm rejected all the time on first dates. It hurts. However, *sometimes* for some reason, I just click with a woman, and we have sex many times.

I did absolutely nothing different on these successful dates than on dates that were unsuccessful. I was just myself and talked about what I wanted while also listening to her.

It really is just ""luck"" finding a woman who's into you. One can raise the probability of success, by increasing the number of women they talk to, and other things like working out, getting their life together etc... but at the end of the day, it's simply increasing chances, but not guaranteeing anything, it's still luck.

He is a white man from the USA.  I asked to use his iPad to watch Netflix before he went to shower as my phone was charging across the room. That’s when I get a notification from the Reddit app, it was a response to a comment he had made. I go onto his account and see that he has a lot of - karma so being nosy I go onto his account. He has 0 posts. I go onto his comments and that’s when I see the disgusting comments he made to random people.  He was being incredibly racist to black people especially black women.  He was commenting all black woman as fat and ghetto in the fatlogic subreddit. He commented mockery about black women accents in America etc comparing them to monkeys and all that stereotypical immature nonsense.   One comment that struck was me was that ghetto gaggers should be normalised on television as it shows how black women deserve to be treated. They are undesirable. Most of his comments were deleted but these are the ones I saw. As dumb and ridiculous as these comments are, it hurt a lot.   He had another Reddit account where his posts were more serious so it seems like this account was to just be horrible to strangers.   I immediately got my phone and my bag and left. Went home blocked all his contacts and decided I was never going to see or talk to him again. His sister has been calling non stop and I am now unsure how to play this situation. Did I go about this the wrong way?  I am just confused because we never had issues being in interracial relationship.  There’s never been any tension between us about me being black and him being white. His family were incredibly welcoming and so lovely.   I just wanted to see if I did the right thing.

"Does my dating history look like a red flag to guys? I'm 24F. Guys often ask me for my dating history and I'm nervous my dating history looks off-putting. I haven't been in a single official relationship but I've had dating experience. I went on my first date in 2020 and had all my firsts that year. The guys I had met during that year were all shitty (I was naive at that time) and I had awful experiences with all of them. One of them even sexually assaulted me, so I took a break. In 2021, I met a guy online and we facetimed everyday and would send each other things to our houses. We were on opposite ends of the country and we went exclusive/official, but he'd constantly flake on our plans to actually meet in person for the first time (we didn't start to seriously make plans to meet till 10 months in). I wasted a year and a half on this loser and yes I very much learned my lesson.

That brings us to mid-2022. I met several other guys, didn't really go anywhere but my experiences weren't at least as bad as before so it was fine. It's 2023 now and I moved to a new city earlier this year. It's harder for me to get dates in this city than my hometown but that's okay. I met a guy I hungout with consistently for 4 months straight. I asked for exclusivity and he turned me down and there was a bit of a story for this (you'll have to scroll down a couple weeks back on my post history if you want the whole story). 

This guy hurt me a lot and made me feel sorta unvalued so right now, I'm taking a break from dating for a couple months. I'm just worried that this looks like a red flag to other guys.

"Is it a good idea going for taller women than me Hey all,

I am 5'6(1.68m) and as I am 19, I am pretty sure I have stopped growing. Anyways, I've always been single and no it's not because of any appearance related insecurity. I'm quite happy with how I look and work out regularly to always improve. It's just that I was always shy in high school and had no idea how to talk to or approach women. 

Anyways as I enter freshmen year, I was hit by a new sense of motivation. So, the uni I went to is one of those filled with 'kids of the rich elite' type place and mann everyone here knows how to look good. 

The women here, ohhh man they are next level pretty. To be surrounded by so many tall and slender beautiful women made me y'know....feel the need to finally get out of my shell and touch some grass. So here I am.....in reddit.

Ok, jokes aside, I sure am working on my personality and I am socializing with girls, guys, everyone. I haven't done much romantic approaching but I have made friends. I guess the thing is I tend to feel a bit intimidated with the approaching, especially with women who are taller than me.

Now obviously I am not saying I only plan to approach the long legged once, it's just I don't see why I should limit myself just because some people on internet says short = disadvantage.

Anyone here had success with women taller than them? Would love to know some tips. :)

"My fiancé got another woman pregnant. 
My fiancé and I have been together for five years and have a child together. I thought he was the love of my life. I finally felt complete and was so in love with the family we had grown. He seemed so content with us. Constantly telling me how thankful he was to have found a woman like me and how much he loved our family. However, he just told me he got another woman pregnant… He seems so devastated by it, but seeing how we have a child together, I’m assuming he knows how it happens. 
This honestly disgusts me and makes me question everything he’s ever said to me. I haven’t broken things off with him yet because first, I still love him, even though I hate what he did. And second, I hate the idea of my child growing up in a broken home. I feel like the one suffering most, will be my child. I’m also hesitant because every single past relationship I’ve been in, I’ve been cheated on. I always left, thinking the next guy would actually value and respect me, but they never did. I haven’t dated a certain type either. I’ve dated different races from different social classes, and different crowds of people. My exes couldn’t be more different from each other. This makes me think that maybe this is just what people do now. I don’t know..

If I stay, my child might grow up with the idea that cheating is okay. However, if I leave, I’ll  feel like it’s partially my fault my family is broken and I’ll be leaving who I considered my soulmate. 
 
Ultimately, I want to do what’s best for my child and I think I’m too heartbroken and confused to figure out what that is at the moment. I love him very much, but is love enough?

All I do outside of work is lift weights and be moody alone and outside of work I have no interaction with anyone.

"dating as a gay teenager I am a male 17 year old. I knew I liked boys when I was in 4th grade. My friends and I at that age would experiment with one another. Looking back, I'm in awe. I cannot believe 10 year old me was experiencing sexual arousal. So as  I got older my friends and I aged out of it.   
Then when we went into 7th grade. An old friend of mine, Brain, helped me get off and I helped him the same way. But my big mouth couldn't keep that a secrete. Brain was really hot at the time and he still is. Well, word got out that me and Brain did stuff. He was scared to death. My school had always knew I was gay and I was bullied from a very early age. But, no one knew Brain was gay. So after that happened we stopped talking for a while. Then going into 9th grade, me and Brain had sex. There is a whole story behind it, so if anyone cares I can tell you in the comments. But after we had sex, Brain ghosted me. Stopped talking to me in all and would not even look at me in school. I still think about him and I am less attracted to him now, but he is still hot lmao

but while all that was happening I was on and off with a guy. we had started dating in 6th grade and continued through 10th. we would get together then break up then get together then break up. i broke up with him every time too. i told him i loved him and i never did. never once. i just wanted a boyfriend and we hooked up again more recently. we hadnt talked in months but I got drunk and called him. we hooked up on the side of the street lmao

anywaysssss. so yes i have had some gay experiences and like dated around. i have hooked up with many of childhood friends. but not in a long time. where my dating life hurts is i havent found someone i loved or was obsessed with. there is one guy more recently that is cool and hes nice. there is a huge story behind him but i dont feel telling it. its just my girl friends have 5 guys all over them. wanting them at bars, or where ever we go. makes me feel so ugly and like i will never find anyone. i dont think i will ever find someone i love enough to marry. i know what i wanted in a guy but i dont think i will ever find someone who likes me back. i dont believe guys when they tell me they think i am hot. i only trust the ugly ones because i knew they mean it. but the hot ones, i feel like say things to please me. because i do that, not calling myself hot just i have played guys before so i knew when guys do it to me. or i at least have a feeling. its just really hard. 

i have my senior year left, so i hope after when i go to college it will get better. i wanna meet gay friends and gay lovers. i wanna just embrace myself and i want people to accept me. any advice lol?",natureswind,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l70bt/dating_as_a_gay_teenager/,1691467517.0,1.0

Ok, so i met this really cute girl. I got the confidence to go up and talk to her. I talked to her, and she seemed really engaged in the conversation. She seemed really happy and smiling, and overall having a good time. 
I was in a rush to make it to an event downtown so i cut our conversation short to around 3-5 minutes. So i asked her “Hey, can i get your number” she went with no hesitation, “um sure” and grabbed her phone to get my number. i ended up just having her put her number in my phone. 
SO, i texted her about 4 hours later so i wouldn’t look too desperate. i said “hey, this is (blank) from (blank)”

NO RESPONSE! 

I followed it up a few hours later assuming she just missed my message with a “how was the rest of your day?” 


Nothing!!

“Hey! Is everything good? No problem if you don’t want to text. Just making sure everything is ok.” 
Nothing. I called her around 4 hours later and left a voicemail and still haven’t heard anything back from her. She didn’t block me because it says delivered still.

"Missed opportunity or bad timing? About a month ago I met this man at a bar in the city. We ended up talking the entire night and genuinely had such a good time I sort of forgot where my friends went. 
Once I let him know I was leaving he asked for my number and I told him to meet me at the second bar which he did. We both ended up parting ways, with me never expecting to see or hear from him again because he was one of the many random side characters of a drunken night out. Lo and behold he texts me the next day asking to hangout, which I politely declined bc I was leaving for a trip the following day and needed to pack. I told him once I’m back we’d plan something, saying that as a throw away not really expecting him to ever reach out again. 
Well the day after I got home he messaged me asking how my trip was, and letting me know he’d love to “hangout and catch up” before he leaves. (I just remembered he works in a diff state and was leaving in a few weeks to go back) So I’m like plagued that this random man from a dingy bar is still wanting to see me, especially since he’s leaving. So I shot him a day to meet the following week and he said he would have to let me know but it should good.
 He never let me know which I was so confused about given the fact that he was the one pursuing me consistently, and I told my friends about it. 
My friends were encouraging me to send a follow up text because they said that night he was like a puppy dog, following me around and super engaged with me. They said he seemed very into me. So I swallowed my pride and shot him a text letting him know I’d be at this bar tonight if he’d like to meet me. He responded relatively quick and sincerely apologized for not getting back to me and asked when I was around the following week. I told him it depends on the day and to lmk his schedule and I never heard back. We follow eachother on Instagram and he likes my posts and whatnot so Ik it wasn’t anything intentional, I’m assuming the timing was just pretty bad and he feels it’s not worth it since he’s leaving. My thing is, I really liked him the night we met and he seemed to really like me. He was also just so genuine and kind. 
I was and still am drawn to him I’m not sure why, especially bc I really don’t go on dates as I’m sort of picky when it comes to men. Not in a vain way I just know how toxic the dating scene can be and I’d rather just have my peace. I just wished I had more clarity on the situation and why he was so pursuant just to not answer. 
I truly in my gut don’t think it was anything genuinely bad, given how truly nice he was and how we laughed like the entire night.

I’m getting ready to move.  And I feel like I haven’t been able to have any genuine connections with the women I’ve matched with on the apps.  I feel like I’d rather just stick to living my life once I move into my friends apartment and just letting whatever happens to me happen.

At the start of the relationship we were kind of rocky as he was hard to trust on anyone due to his past relationships and I was not very honest. As time passed by we became more and more toxic towards each other with him accusing me of cheating on him and I became more nasty with my choice of words towards him. It got to a breaking point when I was at my uni and he kept on calling me at random times to try to catch me if I was cheating on him at random times and some times at 3 am in the morning, and after that i blocked him and not speaking to him.

Along the time when we didn’t speak (about 4-6 months) I tried to heal myself from what happened. I tried to learn ways I can improve myself from what happened. But with more days passed I feel more and more sad and depressed. I feel like I did him wrong and I should’ve treated him better, that his fear and insecurities should have been treated better. So I cave in and text him back

I convinced him to try again and eventually he did. We were back to dating again but this time it’s different. I noticed that he didn’t try to initiates any dates or anything romantics. I was the one who always the one that ever called him to be with him, he only ever called me when he thinks I’m cheating and doing something behind his back. I sent him gifts and love letter to make sure he knows that he’s loved but I never received anything or any same efforts. I feel like this time he wasn’t here, that he was not present. I feel like he was not in the relationship fully, it felt like he had his one foot out and when I brought it up to him he didn’t deny it and said that I was frustrating him. He was right on that I was pushy and at times I was still nasty with my words whenever we start to fight again. We fought a lot about a lot of things big or small, mostly we fought because I feel like he didn’t want anything to do with me. The fight kept going on until at one point he dumped me because of a long going fight that I was upset about him spending more of his time with his friend than me. This time we dated for about a year and a month, if I’m not mistaken.

After three months of not speaking to each other he finally messaged me back saying that he wanted to talk so I talked with him and it turned into four days of him convincing me to get back together. I tried to think and feel with my guts if this is the right choice. After he dumped me I’ve been managing myself well and I had come to a realisation that we were toxic and that maybe we shouldn’t be with each other because I feel like we both have two different values, understanding and age gap. So I did what I thought was best and I told him that I can’t do us anymore and he got upset and depressed. The final call was us crying and just telling each other how much we loved each other. Yes I do still love him but it’s just that after the second breakup it’s just that I was left with a distasteful feeling about our relationship, that maybe we really shouldn’t be with each other. But his effort to finally make up for how he treated me and his wrong doings is there, like I see him actually trying to make us work. He is also currently still messaging me about how he wanted us to be together and how much he loves me. His messages make me feel sad and made me feel like I made the wrong choice. That’s what I’m feeling left confused about, what do I do?

"I (F 24) was in a relationship with a serial dater (M 26)!! Stay tuned for relevant information about warning signs and other details. I know some of you are probably thinking ""Why would you date a serial dater?"" Just read through everything first and save your comments for the next post please lol.

My now ex-boyfriend did all these grandiose, romantic things way too early. He did this to latch me on. The rest of our time together was purely for his own satisfaction. He made it seem like he sacrificed everything and had gone out of his way to spend time with me. All to manipulate me.

Once I moved out of town, he barely texted and called me anymore, then he ghosted and blocked me out of nowhere. It's terrible. People like him need serious help and it doesn’t help that he has the money to afford it. Educate yourself about serial daters and recognize the signs that you’re being manipulated!!!! Being manipulated can have serious psychological and mental effects I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

I’m sure the majority of the redditers in the dating community know/have heard about serial daters and/or the signs of lovebombing/manipulation.

Deep thought So my cousin (female) continues to date bad men! I’ve tried to hook her up with men who have great futures but she keeps going back to guys who like to be irresponsible. Why do women do this? It’s like they find the negative traits in a man attractive. I’d like to hear from both men and women on their opinions of this. By the time she gets smart and wants a man who’s a good man she’ll be heartbroken 20 times and at that point you’re useless as a partner and now he has to deal with issues that he didn’t create!,Reasonable-Video-771,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l65cm/deep_thought/,1691465051.0,1.0
"People who don't ask anything or contribute to the conversation drive me crazy! I've had this happening both in dating apps and in real life. And as a bisexual guy, this has happened to me with both men and women! 
You know what I'm talking about? When the other side doesn’t give you anything to work with?

You ask a question about them, and they answer it in such a boring way, with no follow up and no way for you to follow it up with anything, so you just clumsily move on to the next question. 

And they don't ask you anything about yourself in return. Not even a simple ""how about you?""
If you stop asking them questions, the conversation will just end because they are not contributing anything. 

Now, you may think that this is just a case of them not being interested in the interaction, but I had multiple times when I was sick of being the only side that keeps the conversation going, and I stopped texting, and a day later I got a ""??"" from the person. 

One girl actually texted me ""is that it?"". IS THAT IT??? 
I didn't respond, but I should have. I should have said ""I don’t work for you! I'm not your personal entertainment for the evening! How about you put in a little effort too?""

What's the point? Why even match or go on a date if you're just going to sit there, expecting to be interviewed??? What, are you promoting a movie?!

"Feeling guilty about expressing emotions will be the thing that makes me drop dating altogether Like why do I have to feel bad about expressing myself? When I think of any women I've ever dealt with, it always ended or changed when I opened up about how I've felt. I feel like if I never expressed how I felt I could have had a lot more luck in my dating life. Even with my recent breakup last week, her main hang up was that I made things difficult by making her think too hard or claims I liked to argue when I was never trying to argue, I was just saying how I felt.


I'm not a fucking robot. If every woman I deal with is going to expect me to be one then honestly I'm done with this shit. I try but I can't. I'm just not like that.

"Losing patience with girlfriend, dont know what to do So in the beginning of our relationship everything went smoothly but I cheated on her in the first month, with an ex i want over. I didnt tell her bet she found out, we worked our way through it we talked and communicated and till this day were fine abt it. Im super loyal and dont talk to anybody. But in our relationship i frequently heard that I was doing more then she did, But it was a honey moon phase so I didnt see it. Were together for 8 months and till the problems came around 6-7 months everything was good I was super happy, but after a period i noticed that I did more effort in certain things, for example I would satisfy her more the she satisfies me. I would go 2 months dry and she wouldnt do anything abt it till i said something (I kept on satisfying her). Also during seggs and foreplay shes like very lazy and not like creative, she mostly lays on her back. Today we had sex but she only wanted missionary for her hip and wouldnt do doggy or her on top, instead she just lays there and does nothing and always during sex when I put on the condom she just lays there makes me do all the work. She just doenst want to put the same effort in as me and im scared for the future, she was also like very stingy and always taught i would pay, for example she wanted to go to an restaurant but i said i didnt had any money so she said we could eat something small and cheap and she didnt suppose to pay herself, I also feels like its hard for her to pay anything for me, one time i paid dinner for 30 euros and the day after she bought a pizza of 5 euros for me but she was doing like not happy abt it complaining and like not doing it out of free will so i said i wanted to pay back and she accepted. She doesnt put effort in like apologising, If im in the wrong i always give her a good feeling say sorry and understand her say that i love her but if it comes to her she just says sorry and says it wont happen again which doesnt give me a good feeling, she one time went to a party too but there wasnt any service but we had a fight before and she just started it and i was pissed so without any service she just said sorry two times and didnt connect me till she got home at 2:30 am she just called me to say she didnt have service, the next day i said i didnt like it and i wanted reassurance but i feel like i need to ask for everything and for the minimum, To be treated like i treat her, to get satsfied in bed and thats she reassures me without me asking or ist stingy or gives me a good feeling after she does something.

"Am I (22f) overreacting to what my bf (21m) did/is this cheating? Okay ill try to keep this short and concise.
I met my bf about 6 months ago and things have been going very well. We both have some bad previous experiences with love (for me: dishonesty, for him: cheating) but we've been able to communicate and feel save around each other...till now 👁👄👁


For context, he is veryyy into the bdsm/fetish lifestyle were I am not but open to it. He has been trying to slowly open up to me but I could tell that there was  lot he didnt share (also related to some bad experiences on his part) so I just tried to stay patient and let him do things in his pace.

Fast forward to Saturday: he meets my family for the first time, this is a VERY big deal for me and things seemed to go swimmingly. 
That is until a few hours later...were I find him commenting and dm-ing a girl (multiple times) on a hardcore/specific fetish subreddit a month ago. 
I contacted the girl, she confirmed it was sexual.
To me this is cheating. 
The next day I confronted him and basically told him that I feel disrespected and wanna break things off.

We talked in person and well, he broke down crying, telling me I'm his entire world and he'd never hurt me intentionally blabla...but also that to him this is not cheating? Him being into the kinkier side of things, sex and emotions are separate so purely sexual things...are not cheating? Although this might be true to some we NEVER established this as a rule so I dont think the ""intentions"" change anything here. He also said that he was scared of rejection based on his kinks, which is why he did it.

I still feel like this should be the end, he does not want to accept that and said he would never do anything like this again now that he knows my boundaries. 


What do you guys think,  am I acting too harshly?


TLDR: Bf is very into BDSM, I am not - based on bad previous experiences he opted out of introducing me into his lifestyle and instead sexted a girl on a specific subreddit.

"Guys, if you struggle with confidence, it might just be because you don't believe in whom you have become. Men, 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever heard the phrase, ""Stay true to yourself?"" What if you do not ask women out because you feel like a fraud, or believe you aren't handsome enough, have enough swag, not smart enough or not interesting enough?  

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, you will not be enough of something to many women out there in the world, but I'll submit that there are ways for you to build yourself up to be at least a somewhat decent man for the right woman. I can think of three simple things we can do to upgrade our confidence and provide ourselves a chance to get a yes from a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Create the time to discover values we can adopt, such as wisdom and gratitude

Adopting values can enrich the soul of anyone. It is widely known that the eyes are the windows to the soul, so imagine how attractive you could be if you become a man who continuously learns humility, bravery, financial wisdom, courage and the more? Whatever you value will be reflected from you, one way or another. 



2. Be more open to learning new things

Studies show that maintaining a healthy appetite of learning new things is great for a happier lifestyle. Whether it is by way of academics, learning about cultures, learning a fighting style or learning about nature, etc., the thirst for knowledge can help you think more positively about life in general. It would seem to me that men who have an optimistic view (but not an unrealistic view) of life have a better chance to attract and date women than those who think the worse of life and have low energy overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Network with coed groups of people who share an interest you already have

Chances are, there are beautiful women who love some of the same things you do and want to talk about those things. A great way to learn how to talk to women is by talking to them about something they are excited about.  

Am I wrong? Ladies, what do you think?

"I'm not sure what to do? Hello everyone. Yesterday I hung out with a girl and her friend(my friend's gf) and my friend. Actually, my friend set up the ""date"" since he says I need to get more action. We went bowling, ate food then I was chilling with the girl alone for a while. We got along well, gave her my number and later she texted me saying that this is her phone number. The thing is that I don't think she found me attractive(I think I'm already friendzoned lol).  I say that because she seems very outgoing and would say what's on her mind. For example during the ""date"" she would complement her friend which is expected, also complimented my friend's earrings, and she would say stuff like ""oh how cute you both look together, when is it gonna be my turn"". I didn't get any compliment besides that I seemed smart, didn't feel like one. I called her cute, so I guess she knows I find her attractive. Also, that she lives like 40 minutes away from my hometown, and I don't have a car, is making hesitant to even try. She has a car though and loves driving.

  
The thing is that I'm not in love her like crush love type, but I do find her attractive and would like to hang out with her 1 on 1. I also would like to get more experience in the ""romantic world"" since I don't have the much experience in the first place.  I was thinking of starting a convo talking about her test today and talk about other stuff and then ask if she wants to hangout in my hometown to get food or something? Not sure if I should even call it hang out or a date. I guess I also fear being rejected because it would hurt the ego a little bit. I'm 20 M btw and she is 20.

During this trip we hung out and talked a lot and even flirted a little bit, and she asked me twice on the trip if we could hang out when we get back.

"How do you get out of this endless loop? I have no idea if anyone is in the same boat as me, but I feel like I'm in this endless loop when it comes to dating and making friends. The loop of you don't want to go out because you don't have any friends to do it with. Then you can't make new friends because going out to do things by yourself is 'weird' or 'creepy.

I'm an early thirties guy and all my friends are married or in LTR with kids. When I try to make new friends they always end up just moving away or are here for work and travel a lot. Normally I love doing things on my own like hitting the gym, going to a movie, restaurant or just cruising around. Bars aren't my thing at all and I feel like that's the only place that's socially acceptable to go by yourself besides the gym. Like would go to a concert alone? Would you go to the club by yourself? Probably not.

I'm not blaming anyone for why I don't have many friends, maybe it's just me that's the problem...but it's also really hard to make new friends in general. Especially good ones you can rely on and trust.

In turn, I get easily upset when I have to work a long shift and can’t see him at the end of the day. When I’m upset about forgetting him I just get annoyed, want more attention, and turn out being disappointed that he doesn’t understand how difficult it is for me. He has an incredible memory and tries to comfort me over the phone, but it usually just makes me more defeated because I can hear him not empathizing the way I want. I’ve communicated how valuable our time is, and he makes so much time for me in his schedule. I feel needy about wanting more even though I already get so much… But it’s truly difficult when I can’t remember the time we have together. Maybe this isn’t even the right sub for my processing? I’m not sure. Any thoughts on how to be patient with the situation?

"All the hard work was worth it For the lasy few years I was working on myself but it seems to give no result. I lost a lot of weight and started working out(now I am pretty lean and muscular) got rid of acne, fixed my hairstyle and wardrobe.

"I have too many hoodies My long term gf (19f) and I (19m) broke up earlier this year. I’ve been slowly working on myself and healing (she broke up with me and was physically and mentally abusive during that break up period) and I’m doing a lot better now. I’ve had a lot fewer panic attacks and stuff and have decided to get back in the dating scene. 

It’s been a couple months, but I met this girl I absolutely adore. She’s so gorgeous and compatible with me and we have our first date this Wednesday. 

The only problem is that now I’m remembering all of the things I missed from when I was in a relationship: cuddles, kisses, even just hugs when I have a bad day. I know I can’t make things move fast, I know it’s unhealthy. I’m just so excited to get back to the things I miss.

I was just going through all of my clothes trying to pick out an outfit for the date, and I realized that I have way too many hoodies, because my ex would always steal mine, so I would buy new ones, but when we broke up she gave all of them back and with that realization my heart broke all over again because I don’t have anyone to steal my hoodies.

"Advice on interpreting this guy’s history Hi all! 

I recently met this guy and we have been getting along well.  He has shared some info of this past relationship and I find myself have some questions. 

He is in his early 30’s and his last relationship lasted 8.5 years.  He said the reason they broke up was because he decided to move to another state for a great job opportunity and she didn’t want to follow him due to her wanting to live close to her family and friends.  At first this sounded reasonable to me but after thinking about it for a bit, I wonder how someone wouldn’t move with their SO to start a new life if they had been together for that many years?  If it was moving to a new country I can understand, but the flight is only 3 hours between the two states. 

Then one time he mentioned something along the lines of him still being loyal to his ex even though he was a professional football player.  I remember thinking like was it supposed to be something to be proud of because he had many opportunities to cheat? 

Maybe I’m overthinking this but these two things did stand out to me for some reason.  What are y’all’s thoughts?",GlamGlossier,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l3uyv/advice_on_interpreting_this_guys_history/,1691458785.0,1.0

"My (29F) BF (31F) just disappears when he is overwhelmed. I (29F) met a guy (31F) about six months ago on a dating website. We started talking and exchanged messages for the first three months due to our busy schedules and him mainly traveling a lot for work. We both have demanding careers, and I've been taking a break from work due to depression and burnout and an anxiety disorder. I've been seeking therapy and taking medication for eight months. He also works abroad frequently and has been dealing with severe depression but hasn't sought therapy. He doesn't have much of a social network either.

In late May, we finally met in person and had a great time talking. We continued to communicate daily, and three weeks later, he invited me to join him on a work trip abroad so we could see each other. We spent the evenings together and had a good time. However, when I suggested that we see each other more often and he come to my place after work, he explained that his depression and stress prevent him from doing that. He also expressed fear of losing me because of his mental state because he might be „too much“.

After another three weeks, he invited me to spend a few days together at a cottage he rented for a few days off work, where he opened up about feeling that his life lacks meaning and how he's scared people away in the past. Since then, we haven't seen each other because he can't bring himself to go out after work or deal with parking difficulties near my place since I live in the busy city centre. I recently told him that this situation is weighing on me and that I need more from our relationship. He responded by saying he feels like a burden and doesn't want to do things halfway with me as he‘s scared to mess it up. He promised to try when he feels better. The argument escalated ad I haven‘t heard from him in 10 days. Thats what he often does when he feels oberwhelmed. I told him how important communication is for me and that it is very hard for me to with him going into „hiding“ for up to 2 weeks.

I feel conflicted because I want to support him, but his lack of availability is becoming too much for me. I've already done a lot for him, but he hasn't been able to reciprocate.

"International couples please help 


First of all, I’ve never done this and still in the early stage of the whole process. So please be mindful and i’d appreciate for the genuine advises. (Throw away account for this purpose). 

I (33M) this girl(31F) on dating app. At that time i was seeing someone for about a week or two in so we didn’t get to talk much but have facetimed and called. The main problem was that this girl lives in East Asia(sorry i wont reveal the country) and I live in California. Realistically I took it as just a PenPal type of thing. After about a month of seeing the girl in California we decided to go separate ways and I have kinda given up seeing people here (ive already met 3 people since moved here about 3 months ago). And then the girl in EA has been keep talking to me. So ok, let’s see who this person is. Surprisingly we clicked very well and lot of similar interests, background and there was 0 language barrier since we both know a lot of languages. Past 2 weeks we gradually spent more time together on screen and talked about so many things including future plan and how we are still single now. I realized that we both started to develop feelings (i think i know what some of you might say about this…). Every day definitely the conversation is moving towards us getting serious. I definitely suggested we don’t rush and go day by day.  Eventually we are talking about visiting each other and see where that takes us. She works for a big American company and if there is an opening, she can technically transfer to where im at. But also we have lots of questions and fear or being international and away from each other.

"My eighth one-night stand on a herpes dating site: A candid tale of a fleeting connection Late evening on a Thursday, I found myself at a dimly-lit jazz bar, waiting for my date from a herpes dating site — the eighth one-night stand I’d arranged through it. She introduced herself as a graphic designer, casually dressed yet strikingly beautiful. Her auburn hair cascaded down her shoulders lightly, her hazel eyes sparkled as she spoke, and there was a warm quirk to her smile that immediately put me at ease.

We started off with drinks, exchanging tales about our everyday lives — hers filled with sketches and designs, mine filled with my work, passions, and past experiences. Tentative discussions soon gave way to deeper conversations, weaving a fleeting affinity between us.

Soon, enough, we found ourselves leaving the bar to take a stroll under the moonlit sky, sharing an ice-cream cone as we wandered aimlessly through the city streets. Her laughter at my jokes, her insightful comments on everyday life, and the way her hand occasionally touched my arm had an inexplicable charm.

As the night wore on, we ended up at my apartment. With an unspoken agreement, we found ourselves crossing the boundary of casual interaction and stepping into a more intimate realm. It was a simple act, devoid of ostentatious passion but full of a shared understanding that lent it a distinct warmth.

Our connection was ephemeral—lasting just the one night—and as the first light of dawn seeped into my room the next day, we parted ways: no promises made, no expectations drawn. Yet it was an encounter I will always remember for its unpretentiousness.

At the end of the day, the simplicity of our encounter drives home the point that one-night stands, especially among us in the herpes dating community, needn’t be any less meaningful than longer connections. Indeed, the heart of any relationship, be it fleeting or lasting, resides in mutual understanding, respect, and the acceptance of our shared human experiences.

"Is it weird to be attractive and be in celibate for over 2 years at a young age? Is there something wrong with me? I wonder if it is weird because 2 yrs ago i cut off dating completely bc a trauma and started to chance my mindset. By celibate i mean not meeting/kissing/or touching any guy for this period of time. I made this descision to grow my business and to work on myself and become a better verson of myself, which made me so much happier now than i was 2 yrs ago as a party girl. I recently cut out alcohol and its been 7 months, so theres minimum sociolisnig for me thats kind of sad but i love to be alone by myself. I want to spend time with someone with the same values as me, and im picky, so i have 2 friends i hang out with sometimes. This life is very different to the life i had, and i love this lifestyle so much more than the party lifestyle with a lot of friends/sosioliaing and i think being in celibate saved me to grow and learning to love myself/be there for yourself and every girl needs to try this. But the problem is:

I have recently met someone and i cant do anything sexual even if my body wants to, my mind just says no. So i think somethings wromg woth me lol im not gonna go to details but what can i do? I feel comfertable and loved, so why do i think this? 

I wonder if you think its weird for an attractive women to be in celibate? By attractive meaning, getting things free cause your pretty, random guys talking to you or give special treatment, get multiple insta dms everyday, or the days i post something (im just npt entertaining them), and being confident in herself and loves herself.

"Guy I’m going out with is moving really fast… So I met this guy about 4 ish weeks ago and we found out we have a lot in common. We both are pretty nerdy and have similar hobbies. He asked me out on a Monday and scheduled a date for later in the week. Towards the end of the week, we texted for hours. I honestly wanted to leave some things to talk about for the date but at the time, the conversations were really flowing. On the date he was really sweet, paid for the meal, and the conversations were still flowing. We did end up kissing but it felt natural, plus I had known him weeks prior to the date. 

Just for some background, he has had 1 relationship about a year ago with a girl that lead him on for awhile. He said that it still makes him mad to think about but that he has 0 feelings for her and is ready to move on. My last relationship was over a year ago and I have also moved on. He is very proactive and is always thinking about fun things we can do for upcoming dates like movies, bookstores, and things that pertain to our interests. He has no problem with paying for things even though I offer, and picked me up for our first date. The problem is that I think we are moving quite fast and I want our relationship to last. He has already asked to make it official which I agreed to because I do see myself being with him in the future. However while planning our second date, he said that he wanted to take me to meet his parents. He wasn’t pushing it onto me but he did ask if I would like to.

"Do I mention I have a kid on my profile? Ok I know this is a HUGE debate amongst people and I do see both sides.

I'm a 24 female and after almost 2 years, I'm finally ready to start dating again. I'm setting up a dating profile on hinge and I'm really struggling with whether I mention I have a child on the profile. 

Reasons to put I have a kid:
- I'm not trying to hide my kid / get more matches
- I don't want anyone to feel like I wasted their time
- I am proud of my son
- I of course want to match with people that are okay with kids / want children in the future

Reasons to not put I have a kid:
- I have read a lot of experts explaining that putting you're a parent on a dating profile makes you a target for pedophiles and my sons safety is something I take VERY seriously
(I know there's only the one reason to not put I have a kids, but it's a really big reason and unfortunately there are sick people out there who specifically look for moms on these apps)

What I'm leaning towards doing:
I'm leaning towards not mentioning it in my profile, get to know each other, and then, if I like the person, mention it on the first date. Of course if it comes up naturally in conversation before then I'll definitely bring it up. I don't feel like waiting till the first date is really wasting anyone's time and would prevent any weird people from matching with me BECAUSE I'm a mom.

I just like watching cool action animes.,One_Country1537,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l1k5f/been_insulted_for_liking_anime_is_this_justified/,1691452787.0,0.5
Can't stop wanting to hook up again I have been seeing this guy for the past 7 months.  However he travels alot for work so there were months we didn't see each other but would still text etc.  We have hooked up before but alot of times we just make out or cuddle and nap together.  Last night we fully hooked up and it was great.  Except today its the only thing I can think about.  I find this guy extremely attractive and just want to make out and fuck him all the time.  How do I manage this? He also lives not super close (a solid drive) and again his work schedule is chaotic so we don't see each other regularly.,Exotic-Tear3482,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l1jiw/cant_stop_wanting_to_hook_up_again/,1691452743.0,1.0
"I made this list of rules I follow when it comes to approaching women cold in public. So I'm a larger 6 foot chubby/muscular black man so for me I'm always very cognizant of my size and how I may freak someone women out depending on the setting...that's just how the world works. So years ago I made a list of rules for what I should not do when approaching women cold in the streets 

My rules:


- Do not approach women in darkness or at night unless it's within a location with plenty of people around in the general vicinity. 

- Do not approach women on cell phones or with headphones on

- Do not follow women into buildings that I'm not already going into

- Do not approach women who appear to be in a hurry (don't appear to chase or run after anyone)

- Only under rare circumstances do I approach women walking with a man

- Rarely approach Asian women (they look terrified when I walk up to them)

- Rarely (if ever) approach women with a child

- Always remember you're working from underneath (never go in cocky or arrogant)

- Only go after realistic options 


For me I also think a few places or settings are off limits like funerals, hospitals, or the workplaces and co workers are generally off limits. 

Over the course of my dating life this list has provided me with a good structure to put myself in the best situation to succeed. What are your thoughts?

"Do guys not like traditional women anymore ? Do guys not like traditional women anymore ?


24 year old girl here, I have been having the worse dating experiences my entire life. I recently started trying dating apps since I graduated college since there seems no other way to meet people, guys don’t approach me ever in person and every date turns out terrible. I have a college degree, I’m an accountant making decent  money, and my own apartment and saving up for a house In the next year or so.  I dress feminine and girly and like to take care of myself  and act very polite and I was raised to be more traditional , where the girl is more feminine and takes on the feminine roles since my parents are foreign and raised me that way.  I feel like guys my age that I tried dating aren’t into that. I’m not into the whole hookup culture and I’m looking for a long term relationship and I’ve only been in 2 relationship my whole life. Every date I’ve gone on the guys are always off put when I tell them I’m not into the hookup culture and they always call me inexperienced and prefer a girl with experience even though I’m not even a virgin.  I even been insulted by guys saying I’m too innocent and inexperienced and must have a mental disorder if I haven’t gone on many dates, which I haven’t honestly, I probably been on less then 5 but every single one has made a comment like that. Its hard for me to even land a date cause guys ask to hookup or make sexual comments right away before even meeting. They are also off put when I say I prefer a traditional relationship. I don’t understand men, all I see on social media and podcasts is to not date western women cause they are promiscuous and not wife material yet when there is a traditional girl they don’t want her. What do these modern men want now a days? Is there something I should change? I’m 24 and feel like guys will never mature and it’s making me depressed since I been single for almost 4 years now.",SignificanceSoft1559,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15krsoj/do_guys_not_like_traditional_women_anymore/,1691430724.0,0.67
"I want to break up with my boyfriend but I’m nervous. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two months now officially. Yes I know this isn’t a long time. Lately I just have not been feeling invested. I don’t feel that I am mentally capable of being in a relationship right now and I need time to work on myself. On top of going to school with course overloads and working full time to make rent, I’m trying to work on mental health issues.

I’m worried about breaking up though because I feel that he’s spent so much money on me. We just went on a trip together and my birthday just passed. He bought me gifts as well as paying quite a good portion of the trip, even though I said I would help pay for it. 

I honestly had lots of fun on the trip. I just feel really, really bad. He’s a sweet guy and he deserves to find someone that will suit his needs better than I can. I just don’t see us working out in the future. 

Any advice? I’ve never really had to end a relationship before and the anxiety is eating at me.

"Emotional endurance I’m a very introverted and somewhat emotionally underdeveloped 30 year old man. Meaning that for nearly the last 10 years I’ve closed myself off to nearly every emotion, which led to a few failed relationships. I’ve had 2 somewhat long-term (2 years each) relationships and one casual fling and one what we call a situationship nowadays. The situationship started 4 years ago and I fell hard. I fell in love for the first time at 26 and opened up to someone I probably shouldn’t have. It was an on and off thing for 4 years with a lot of tears. However I’ve improved so much emotionally and let myself open up. Except that once it failed the first time I closed up again and got a girlfriend whom I adored and wanted to love but couldn’t we broke up after 2 years. The woman from my situationship came back earlier this year and gave me hope that we both changed enough that we can make it work. I ended up being hurt again. It took me months to even consider going on Tinder. If I’d have to say I’ve been single for a year as what happened early this year wouldn’t count as a real relationship in my eyes as I was mostly used for sex and basically as a free place to crash at occasionally.


So I’ve cleared some things up with my therapist and felt ready to go “out there” again. A few days ago I’ve posted that I’ve met an amazing girl and how we spent 7 days talking and playing video games all day, touching serious topics. Everyone said I was stupid for being upbeat after such a short period of time. Originally I wished for nothing more than a casual thing but after 2-3 days spent with her, constantly stumbling upon common things I realized I might be ready for something serious and I felt that we might be able to go the distance. I was floored by her laugh, her smile and how intelligent and cute she was. We exchanged photos, goofy videos, we made a lot of plans. We finally went out and the date went great for 4 hours but she had to cut it short because of an apparently real emergency (she sent me the video). We both estabilished physical contact, we held hands, we walked hand in hand, we kissed and it was an extremely passionate one especially from her side. We kissed multiple times. I put her in a taxi and agreed on a followup date next week. On her way home she told me she can’t wait to meet my friends and told me how she showed me and my dog and my friends (showed her a group photo) to her mom and how she thinks I’m cute and whatever. We texted until 6am, I fell asleep. When I woke up later I apologized and she said no problem. Later when she woke up she seemed distant and insanely dry. I’d see her come online and not respond to any of my messages. I sent her another one and she gave me a one word answer. I saw that she updated her profile on Tinder… I had some stuff to do so I decided to wait and see if she texts me - nope, nothing. I waited another day and sent her a message that I feel like something has changed but I accept it, etc. She basically ghosted me.


All I’m trying to get to is that I know it’s stupid to be so excited but it felt like I struck gold. I opened up again and got shown that I did so with the wrong person - again. I consider myself an emotional man now, like for the last few years I cry at sad movies and sometimes stupid things. I don’t know how many more of these I can endure. I rarely fall for anyone but then I fall hard. I like being alone but I get excited when I feel like I can share my life with someone and build a life together.


I feel defeated. I won’t give up but I don’t know how y’all are doing it but I’m so so tired already of the games, the ghostings…


Love you all and wish you all the best luck.",throwaway43565467,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l1avp/emotional_endurance/,1691452147.0,1.0
"Just Me I think I’m done looking for relationships. After my last long-term relationship I feel burned out. There was a lot of trust, faith, and hard work that ended in ashes. 

 I’m afraid to open up to others. I have so much to me that’s interesting and fun, but when I go on dates or meet people I turn into a blank slate. I feel hollow and it made me realize that I’m waiting to become who they want me to be. 

After years of trying to be perfect for my partner I realize now what that did to me. To be perfect for him was to no longer be me. I’m not meek. Like what?! 
I’m actually loud, goofy, boisterous and play waaaaay too much. 

Before I was with him I was a star that burned too hot to hold. Now? I don’t even know. Just easy 

TANGENT: And you know what? Dating just fuckin sucks in general. I mean you literally SHOP for people. Ew this one’s too loud, this one’s too tall, this one has short hair. Like I’d rather just wait for it to happen naturally rather than feel like bad produce. I don’t wanna be your shiny apple 🙄


Instead of having a relationship I’m going to have fun. I’m gonna be obsessed with my hobbies, my goals, my happiness, and my life. I have to work to relight the passion inside of me and another person can’t help with that.

"17M autistic and I prefer to have a neurotypical girlfriend Hey I am a 17 year old boy with (mild high-functioning) Autism and ADHD. I have been dreaming of having a girlfriend for the past 3 years since I never had a first kiss or a relationship before. These are the reasons why I would prefer a neurotypical girlfriend over an autistic girlfriend.

*Alot of the autistic girls I know and seen are not that attractive in looks compared to a typical neurotypical girl I know, looks definitely matter to me as I am aiming to find a girlfriend who has an attractive facial features and an attractive sexy body, I seen lots of autistic girls in real life and online and most of them are quite unattractive with unusual facial and body features and noticeably autistic. Also the way they dress may not be my type either, I would like a girlfriend that usually dresses in clothing I find attractive such as skinny leggings, Nike Clothes, summer dresses, short shorts, spaghetti straps, etc

*Alot of the autistic girls I know are into anime (Japanese animation). I don't want a girl that has a high interest in anime because my former primary school crush who I used to be obsessed with has a high interest in anime and I don't want my future girlfriend to resemble her too much or have too much in common with her (such as anime, similar name etc), also alot of the autistic girls can be quite childish and have interest in cartoons aimed at younger kids like Peppa Pig, Bluey, My Little Pony etc, and I want a girlfriend whos more mature and has typical interests for someone of her age.

*Alot of autistic girls identify as LGBTQ+, studies have shown that only 1 in 4 autistic people identify as heterosexual (that's me), it would be much easier for me to find a neurotypical girlfriend than an autistic girlfriend for that reason

*Having a neurotypical girlfriend could improve my communication skills towards other neurotypicals, I also want a girlfriend who has friends of her own to hang out with to improve my communication skills.",Technology2006,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kv6c8/17m_autistic_and_i_prefer_to_have_a_neurotypical/,1691438144.0,0.75
"Breaking up 4,5 year relationship because of mother in law Hi everyone thats reading,

I dont know if anybody has advice but my life is really hard right now. 4.5 years i met the most kind, respectfull, funny, loyal and amazing man. My boyfriend he is everything and more i can wish for. He is my bestfriend and my true love we really feel this way about each other. I met his mom for the first time and she is a amazing woman. Also kind but kinda obsessed with her son. I found it cute but as we grew closer and closer, she turned a little but weird. 
For almost 2 years now i turned my emotions down because of the relationship she has with her son. I mean great if you have a nice relationship but i believe when you grow older you get a little bit more free, thats not what happing in their house.
His mom when she doesnt get all the attention gets a little bit more snarky with comments or gets a little bit more annoyed with made me feel oncomfortabel. She always talks about her son and how amazing he is and how they are soo close and dont get me wrong this isnt the worst. But when you hear this for 3 years you get a little bit tired of it. One time we had a discussion and my boyfriend agreed with me, she FLIPPED. she screamed how can you agree with her. But its tuff because she isnt always so mean. She has her good days. I thinks she is just really scared to lose her sons which makes me feel not good. I talked to my bf that i dont wanna be in a relationship where i stand between a mom and a son and where is sometimes feel she wants to decide whats best for me and treat me like a child. I am 21. Sooo today….
My boyfriend talk about it and the BOMB DROPPED 
She called me and said missy we have something to talk about. My name is not missy but she said it in a sassy way.
I said can we talk later i am at work. 
Thennn i got a text from my mom saying SHE called my mom WTF to talk about how i am behaving. Me and my mom have a great relationship together and she knows how she made me feel so she didnt respond. Then i got a text from his mom saying.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN GODSNAME, WHY ARE YOU CREATING PROBLEMS?? 

She is pissed….

Idk what to do i love this man so much but its his mom idk if i want this in my life. She always needs to know what hes doing and where he is and she reacts like this. Idk anymore.

"How do I stop caring what others think and self-sabotage when dating? I (24 F) am the only one who is single in my close friends group, and I’ve been having a hard time dating. I used to date men that weren’t my type or physically attractive to me. They always mistreated me or tried to bring me down. I did some healing work and now will not come close to anyone who doesn’t meet my standards, but when someone does meet my standards, I have a hard time accepting that they could be into me. 

My friends also have high expectations for me when it comes to dating. I feel like it’s because they look up to me in a way and they have said that I inspire them as a person. So whenever I go on dates, I can’t help but think about whether my friends would also like this person or whether they would find him attractive. Whenever I’m interested in a guy and think he’s good looking, they always tell me I can do better. However, I think it’s strange because their boyfriends are not the best looking...

I’m starting to think I have some deep rooted insecurities. I can’t even blame it on being a child of divorce because my sibling is in a healthy, long-term relationship. Whenever I’m dating someone, I get really anxious and overthink everything. I end up withdrawing myself because I’m scared of abandonment. 

But if I’m being honest, every guy I’ve met who I’m physically attracted to doesn’t match my personality. Or they’re boring to me and I end up having to carry the conversation. It’s also important to me that I find someone driven and passionate about their career because I value financial stability. For some reason this is rare.

It’s so weird how I’m usually the one who gets hit on or expected to get everyone free drinks in my group. Strangers, both men and women, will go out of their way to compliment my looks in public. But whenever I look at myself I have a really hard time seeing what other people see. I don’t have the best skin (this is my biggest insecurity), I feel like my forehead and nose are too big, I wish I had a smaller chin and narrower shoulders. I also wish my arms and legs were thinner. Wish my skin was lighter. Smaller feet and hands would be nice too. Also bigger breasts… I can go on. It’s hard not to compare myself to other girls, so when someone physically attractive tries to hit on me, I always think that they would look better with a different type of girl. 

Whatever confidence other people see in me is secretly fake. I’m insecure at my core and I don’t know how to fix it. No amount of fake-it till-you-make-it is getting me out of this. Fake confidence has only helped me in academic, professional and social settings. My insecurity has made me develop an avoidant attachment style. I think this is why I’m having a hard time dating but I really want to do life with another person already and it frustrates me seeing other people easily jump into relationships. I don’t know how to fix this.

TLDR; basically men I find physically attractive send me into a spiral where I tell myself I’m not good enough for them. I also can’t help but wonder if my friends would find someone I date attractive, when I know I should only be thinking of my opinion. Not sure if this is normal. What can I do to get over this so I can finally have a boyfriend?",uuniversal,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15l12in/how_do_i_stop_caring_what_others_think_and/,1691451577.0,1.0
"What the hell dude? Basically, I'm gay and I was in a gay relationship, obviously, me (M14 I know I'm young and this is some basic stuff but I'm just feeling sh\*tty I don't know if im allowed to swear lol) and my ex (M16) were dating and we dated for a good 2 months. 

Eventually I broke up the day before band camp, which was a Sunday because I wasn't feeling any type of love towards him, especially after my situation of my house burning down. I just didn't want to throw my problems over to him and hope that he fixes it. So I just told him, I need a break. The day after was band camp, it was a bit awkward but there were a lot more Freshman's and I'm a short guy so I didn't notice him a lot, only during breaks and what-not.  


After band camp ends, I was feeling pretty good because of my friends were here to entertain me and make me happy. That's when I found out last Saturday that, let's call him A, A was matching profile pictures with someone, I thought nothing of it and went on with my day. Then his status goes to ""I lover her."" 

HER!? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GAY?!? no. So currently now, his status is, ""I love her:) she's my baby girl"".  
\*silence\* what the actual hell is this, weren't you just dating me? didn't I just break up with you? Like I know that I broke up with you because I didn't have any type of emotion towards you, but moving on LESS THAN A WEEK after we break up? IS INSANE.  


I then put on my notes TODAY, "":| damn."" and A's friend D dm's me on Instagram saying, ""Huh?"" I say, ""Look at your bestie's notes, idc if you get mad at me or call me out in any way, just damn, that's f'ing insane."" this is what made me furious, it's just the fact that he moved on so soon. AT LEAST GIVE IT A MONTH, anyways, I was talking with D and he was saying he agreed with me which was surprising because D is really close to A and I thought D would take A's side, but he agreed with me and was saying how much he hated D's s/o, and we'll call her H. Me and D hate H, she's the type of girl who jumps boy to boy. Funny enough, H was broken up with the last day of school my freshman year and a week later was texting another guy.  


I end up telling D that I might just move schools because 1, I hate that school, and 2, the house that I REALLY like is near another school and I'd rather go to that school than stay at that school. But all in all, I just needed to vent this out because I'm angry and it's just not making sense to me.

"Should I date a man with whom I had a bad experience again? Need advice. I really need a piece of advice on dating a man with whom I had a very bad experience last year.

I (32F) am new to dating. Had poor experiences with the men I dated earlier. The first guy raped me on my first date ever. The second guy whom I fell in love with was married.

Then, I joined a dating app and talked to a few guys before I chose a guy to date. We met in December last year at a rented apartment and talked for an hour sitting on a sofa before we started drinking. He was a habitual alcoholic but it was my first time and I got pretty drunk. He ordered some food for me and I got a bit sober. Then he sought permission before making out with me. Things got heated up and we were in bed in no time. I was on top but I didn’t enjoy it much. I wanted him to kiss me again and was inclined toward romance. I also wanted him to go down on me because I did that with him, but he refused. He just wanted to have sex only seeming no strings attached relationship. I was confused and in the meantime refused to continue. We had an argument and he got insecure about his size and told me to go to Africa. I lost words and could just say that we probably aren’t compatible. He asked me to leave right now. I put on my clothes and started crying, he hugged me and offered me money which I refused to take and left.

I tried to contact him again when I got an STD because we didn’t use any condom, but he didn’t respond. I got myself treated and forgot about him.

Then out of a sudden, he contacted me in May this year. He was keen on making things right this time around but started masturbating once we were on a video call. I felt disgusted and refused to talk to him further.

He contacted me again in July, apologized for his behavior, and literally begged me to see him again. He wanted to start afresh and assured me he was being honest therefore I accepted to meet him again but first at a public place, so we can talk and I would get an idea if he was really serious and then would proceed further. But he disappeared again.

He again contacted me an hour ago stating his mobile phone got stolen and insisted on meeting him. I live in a different town so he offered to help with conveyance but I refused to meet him now and told him that I’ll inform him when I’m ready.

Now, please give me any suggestions on what to do in such a situation.

"Need advice on whether to pursue this woman or not I met a woman off of a dating app who was keen on meeting me. She was a senior in college and was working on being a teacher in special ed. I am a 25-year-old man that has a job out of college so we kind of are in different stages of our lives. Well, we agreed to meet up at a mall. After we exchanged numbers I noticed she deleted her profile right away, which I thought was a little strange but whatever. I go to the mall and meet up with her after waiting for her to respond to my text. 

After finally meeting up with her, we do some talking and shopping together. She seemed alright and nothing unusual was going on. I told her that I was hungry and wanted to find something to eat. She said we could go back to her college town and get something to eat there. Before we left, this woman was already kissing me and whatnot which was a little strange for me because I just met her. I just of course went with it. When we were eating, she started talking about how she was suing her roommate for 1400 dollars which I thought was a little much. She was also talking about how she was into doing drugs like coke and pills. I got a little turned off by this, but I tried to not be so judgmental. In fact, most of her conversations were about getting money like explaining if a bouncer rips your ID card or not.

Well after I paid for the dinner, she said we could go to her apartment or chill at a bar. I said we could go to her apartment, and I met her there. Well, we started drinking and watching something on her couch, and things go a little freaky. I tried to get the small talk going again because she was really trying to just make out with me so much that I couldn't breathe. I asked If she had finals coming up. She had said she is not in school right now and that she was taking a semester off. I got very paranoid for some reason and thought she was failing out of school because of her drug problem. There was such a creepy and uncomfortable vibe in the room. I just wanted to pack up and leave. When she was ready to have sex, I made an excuse saying that I didn't have a condom and wanted to go home. I went home, and never heard from her again.

Was I In the wrong and just being paranoid? I know she is mad at me for not having sex. Would it make sense to reach back out or leave her alone?",OrangeBarney,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kzzyr/need_advice_on_whether_to_pursue_this_woman_or_not/,1691449004.0,1.0

Girls like two things : attention and food. If you give them both you are guarantee to make a good first impression.

More seriously : I want to give this piece of advice I don't hear about often : don't ask for a number, give your number instead. Girls don't like feeling pressured to do something they don't know if they really want.

"Tinder is for right-handed people 😕 This vent is for the left-handed swipers.

I wish there could be a switch-to-left-hand interface toggle.

To tap through pictures, you have to hold your thumb over the pictures, blocking them, to tap on the right side to flip through them.

Y'all right-handers take for granted how easy it is to rapidly flip through pictures keeping your thumb on the right edge of the screen. 

The up arrow to view bio is on the right side too.

It's just a little aggravating when trying to quickly swipe. Thanks for your empathies :)

Then she asked how long i was here..i told her.

Despite living in England previously, he always maintained contact with and we met up every time I came back during holidays. 

I’ve recently started being really honest about how I feel with him and he wants to see how things progress by meeting up with each other. We’ve planned to meet up next week and have discussed various dates, one option being able to stay overnight somewhere. However, I haven’t seen him in eight months and I’m unsure whether the first meet up should be to stay overnight somewhere with him. We’ve already had sex on various occasions in the past but I want to start on a fresh page now that I’m living in close proximity to him and there is always the possibility of something more arising from this.

Would it be wise to sleep with him again this time around straight away or just take things slow and meet up casually without overnight stays? I am also aware of the age gap but would like to see this going somewhere and I don’t want it to turn into a situationship in which he thinks he can get sex on the tap.

"I think I was wrong for rejecting a guy I met once almost a year ago I (20F) met this guy this last November on a dating app. I live in a small town about a 45 minute drive from a university city, he just graduated and wanted to stay there because he liked the city. 
At the time, I was meeting a lot of guys from the city via dating apps, I got caught in the speedy dating mentality, 3rd date = sleeping together etc (even though I only slept with one of those guys).

When I met the guy I regret rejecting (24M) I was not taking the apps seriously anymore, I haven’t actually gone on a date 4 month prior. But he was sweet and funny and charming and I really liked him, so after 5 days of talking we went on a date. I saw his pictures, he wasn’t conventionally attractive but I liked his looks, he had long colored hair and an inviting smile and I was into that.
None of that changed when I actually met him. He got me a flower, we had a great conversation, no surprises when it comes to looks. I just didn’t feel immediately attracted. I wasn’t repulsed or something and I really enjoyed the date, just not the crazy attraction you see on TV. And I know it doesn’t exist, I really don’t remember what was going on in my mind. 
Two days later I politely told him that I don’t see a romantic future for us (before we met we discussed that we’re both looking for a relationship) and that was it. He accepted it with no drama.
I was generally not in a good place in life back then, I was young and stupid (which I still am haha) but also grieving the loss of a friend 4 months earlier, in a job I hated, just super confused with no idea what I want.

Usually I delete guys I used to date from my instagram, but he was so sweet and nice I couldn’t bring myself to do it. We would like each other’s stories once in a while, in April he sent me a video he said he thought would make me laugh. It turned into a friendly conversation and we haven’t interacted since.

Fast forward to this saturday, I attended a protest in the city nearby. I saw him there from afar, I don’t know if he noticed me too. It wasn’t very crowded and he seemed to kinda glance in my direction every few minutes.
And I can’t stop thinking about him ever since. I think I cut it off too quickly. Knowing myself better now, I know that for me attraction usually builds over time, and I think that I got so caught up in the 3rd date rule mentality that I decided that if I don’t want to sleep with him after a week of knowing each other then there’s no potential there so why go out again. It was a huge mistake. I really think that there was potential there and I was stupid for not going out with him again. I never had such an instant connection with someone. 

I know there’s nothing I can do about it now. I rejected him, and popping up into his life again is unfair and toxic and I should just let him be and find someone who wouldn’t judge too quickly. I just feel bad, I can’t stop thinking about him and I’m really trying to learn from this experience.
My friends are saying that I’m overthinking this and that I should just text him. I feel like it’s not the right thing to do since there’s another person’s feelings involved and it’s not just about me, but this debate is just making me more confused.

The next couple of weeks he stopped reaching out to me for dates but I continued to initiate them but there was clearly less chemistry between us. We didn't kiss as much and it generally felt more friendly. 

On our last date he tells me that he doesn't feel like this is going anywhere as it feels like things had plateaued. He said that the conversation was good but it was hard to escalate things. He agreed that the first few dates were good but doesn't know what happened to the subsequent dates. 

I'm not sure what I could have done to make things more romantic rather than friendly? I was being myself. Was it because I didn't sleep with him? I usually don't sleep with somebody unless theres some level of exclusivity and it felt a bit too early. We're in our late 20s.

I haven't had a relationship in years, and I mean YEARS! So, it's difficult for me to tell if women are interested, flirting or just being friendly. I haven't had much chance to talk to her properly as my role at work is more hands on.

"It felt good to tell them I'm normally not the type to tell people I have a crush on due to confidence issues. It would actually eat me up inside, and I would always kick myself for not saying anything.

Well recently I met someone who I was very attracted to the moment I saw her (her personality only reinforced this attraction). Unfortunately she's been in a relationship for the past few years so trying to date her isn't really an option. Despite this I still worked up the courage to tell her I'm attracted to her. 

Now I know she could've reacted in a negative way, but she was actually flattered. It actually gave me a confidence boost too. It doesn't matter if I never get a chance to date her.

"Unable to say ""something sweet"" to my gf I need some advice.

So I've been dating this girl for the past 6 or so months, and now we're doing long distance. Consequently, we end up having pretty long phone calls. In the middle of the calls, sometimes even randomly, she'll ask me to say ""something sweet"". Now I understand what that means, and in a normal, flowing conversation I do say sweet things, but whenever she goes ""Say something sweet"" out of the blue, I just go blank. It's not that I can't think of sweet things to say, but most of the things that suddenly come to mind seem superficial. Also I have this issue where I feel like I'm being fake if I say something I didn't say naturally. For e.g. I absolutely love how loving she is, and the kind of calm she brings to my life. And when we're talking about something like this, I've let her know that this is how I feel about her. It's just that if I were to blurt it out after she asked me to say something sweet while we were talking about an incident that happened at work, I just end up feeling like I've handed a fake compliment. I mean if I tell her ""You're really pretty"" because she asked me to, I'd end up feeling fake, even though all parts of my being believe that she's really pretty.

Now obviously this isn't a big issue for me and from the looks of it it doesn't seem to bother her as well, but she's an emotionally reserved person so I get this feeling that she asks me to say something sweet when she isn't feeling fine. And so I would like to be able to say sweet things without feeling like I've said something I don't feel.

So what I want to ask, in essence, is this:

1) How do I not blank out when she puts me on the spot by asking for ""something sweet"" in the middle of a conversation?

2) What is it that I should say? Do I hand compliments? Do I recount incidents where she made me feel good? Do I remind her of happy memories? I have no clue.

and 3) How do I say it even though nothing inside me provoked me to say it at that moment?

I just sent a ‘I had a nice time/joke about something we talked about’ text.

He has been active numerous times today and so I find this to be a no-return, as if he was interested (especially after sex) I should have been on his mind enough to reply.  I am quite a proud person, and so I just wanted to check I’m not being too harsh? This is a new cycle of dating for me and so I might be getting clouded by the men putting in a lot of effort and asking me out in past day etc.  I feel like I should write him off in my gut, but double checking!",IllPassage703,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kvcqz/no_follow_up_text_am_i_too_harsh/,1691438542.0,0.5
"I'm questioning my LD relationship My partner (18NB) and I (17F) met online and have been friends for almost two years. They mean EVERYTHING to me and we ended up confessing our feelings three months ago. The thing is, they live in another country and there's no way we can even be together for at least 2-4 years. 

It's extremely stressful for us knowing that we're half a world apart and can't be together for a while. Additionally, we're both aware that we have personal disagreements and while we tolerate those now, I'm afraid those will become issues in the future. For example, I want kids and marriage but they do NOT under any circumstances. We also have lifestyle incompatibilities that aren't issues now since we aren't physically together.

Additionally, there is a guy I work with who I have a tiny crush on, although I feel really guilty for liking him when I'm in a relationship. It's just nice having someone in-person who I can laugh with and be around who makes me feel good, and vice versa. I'm not sure if I actually like HIM or if I just like having someone in-person (although, he is a very nice guy).

My current partner and I feel perfect together and have built a lovely relationship, but it seems so impossible considering all the hurdles we have to jump through. I don't know what to do. I'm very concerned about all of this. This is my first relationship and everything is very stressful as of now.

"26M Need clarification on 24F (texts in OP) Context: I 26M been dating a single mom 24F, who has a 8 year old son. Her baby father is physically abusive and toxic drug dealer, deadbeat who lives with parents.
She lives with with her drug addict family.
 We have been dating over a year. I work 9-5 and still go to college. I love her and her son unconditionally. I give nothing but loyalty, honesty and respect. I take her on many dates and shower her with gifts.
 These past two months I've sensed her strange behavior like not texting back for hours. She dealt with her first important family member death as well.

Recently I texted her about her behavior and how much my anxiety from her not expressing herself or simply not texting back triggers me that triggers her anxiety which pushes her away.

Here are the texts:

24 GF: I get really overwhelmed when you write me a lot at once I feel like I choke up with my words and feel like I don't know where to begin. I want you in my life always your so perfect and sweet and you adore me and there's nothing more I can ask for but a lot of the times I just don't know what to do bc I know you deserve more than what I can give you or offer you at the moment and I know you always say it's okay but it is not because you are a man with needs aswell Needs that I cannot fulfill at this time in my life


24GF: Yes I noticed that too, we definitely trigger eachother. Well you don't rlly trigger me you just make me nervous and guilty feeling. I feel bad that I trigger you cus I definitely don't want to, I care about you a lot and I always want the best for you and for you to be happy you deserve everything &amp; more even if I'm not able to give that to you yet.

"Make Plans With Women and They Flake So, 4x in a row now in as many weeks, I have asked a woman out or otherwise tried to make a plan to go out and I get cancelled on. To be honest, it really sucks a lot more than just being rejected outright because it gets my hopes up, or I otherwise turn down other plans because I am under the impression we were going to be going out and then they flake. I have asked women out both in person and over text. Sometimes it was clear we were just hanging out, others would be for proper dates and one of the times it was clear to both of us it was going to be a ons.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what gives? I would expect if it were a sheer lack of interest, I would be outright rejected. I know some women don't feel safe turning men down in person, but this has also happened with women I didn't ask in person as well. I thought maybe it was an age thing but the women have age ranged from 23 to 32. In some of the instances, I haven't communicated with them again between asking them out and them cancelling. I'll go over my theories, but no one applies to all the situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I say/ do something to turn them off?: Maybe, though with some of the women in question I didn't speak to them again in the day or 2 time in between asking and them cancelling plans and I didn't see them in person. I figure if I were a creep in general, they wouldn't give me the time of day in the first place. Two of the women asked for my number and not the other way around so I'm not sure this checks out. Doesn't make sense to me that a woman would ask for someone's number if they felt he was a creep.

&amp;#x200B;

Were they never interested at all? Again, maybe. But seeing as they had plenty of opportunity to reject me from the get, especially the ones I didn't ask in person this doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.

&amp;#x200B;

Other plans: Well, then why would you agree to do something in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

Reputation: None of these women know each other or are connected to each other in any way. If I have a bad reputation that proceeds me, I have no idea how they would hear about it short of me being in some database I'm not aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

Immaturity: Ok, so two of the occasions were with women in their early 20s, but this one doesn't as readily apply to the other two women in their 30s.

&amp;#x200B;

My prevailing theory: These women are just as burned out from life and work as I am and simply didn't feel like it when the time came and are simply being inconsiderate about how they cancel.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys' thoughts? I'm the only common denominator here. I've really been trying to pin down if I've been doing something wrong so I can change it, and it's driving me crazy.

Long story short, I’m a 22 year old student, still living with my parents because I want to finish school. My parents have a toxic relationship and always have. My dad has narcissistic tendencies and has a history of being verbally abusive to my mom. We have one neighbor, a single middle aged lady, who is always asking my dad for favors. She is always asking my dad to take her to the airport when she needs it, and asking him to feed her dog when she is out of town. To top this all off, she is very hostile to my mom. She never says hi to her and will ignore her presence when she sees her. I just find it very disrespectful that she would ask a married man for favors. YES, I AM AWARE MY DAD IS MORE IN THE WRONG.

"Is this too far and creepy? Ok so 2 days ago I matched on bumble with a girl that goes to my college and we hit it off pretty well. I think I can confidently say that because she said she was glad to see someone from the same school on here and she was engaged in asking me questions which is usually a good sign that they are actually interested and not just swiping. Anyways, I sent a message last night responding to her's and then went to sleep. When I woke up this morning I looked and it says her account was deleted. This means I wasn't unmatched and she either deleted the account manually (meaning she went out of her way to delete her account and then the app) or she was banned. She has a decently uncommon name so I was curious and checked insta and I found it in .2 seconds. Her snap is on there. Is it creepy to add her snap and try to continue the convo? I can't lie, it does feel creepy, but on the off-chance she actually just got banned and was still interested it might be worth it.

So I'm M 28, straight and I've tried just about everything in putting myself out there and yet I've never had a relationship. Over the years I've used like every dating app out there, speed dating, going out to hobby based events, playing open mic nights, helping out on projects, alongsde taking really good care of myself, being well groomed and in good shape etc. And yet I just don't seem to attract a single person. I''ve had quite a few amazing dates but it just seems that the better the dates are, the more they ""just want to be friends"" (either genuinely where they want to hang out platonically or just a nice way of saying no thanks). I've also had plenty of awful experiences too. But the women I've been on first dates with have often said how I'm a catch, I'm good looking I'll find someone etc so I'm confused really.

So my question is, doing all that and getting absolutely nowhere to a shameful degree, I really need to know if I should genuinely stop looking for a relationship or anything like that and accept being an undesired man 🤮

"Should I keep trying with dating apps, or is there a better way to meet women? I'm a 26 year old guy who has never had a girlfriend.  
To be honest, I never really even tried. I've had multiple crushes on girls throughout my life (mostly during school and college, not really at university) and I've never been awkward around girls, but I was always too much of a wimp to ask a girl out. There was this one girl who I was really close friends with from the ages of 14-18, and inevitably I ended up having a crush on her, but I was too scared. We went to different universities, and never spoke again.  
I turned 26 last month, and it hit me that:  
\- I really want to have that emotional connection with someone  
\- I have to make an effort to meet someone, but meeting girls (or just meeting people in general) after university is hard  
\- It's pretty damn embarrassing that I've never had a relationship or even been on a date lol, and it's only gonna get worse the longer I continue like this. If I ever do get a girlfriend, I'm just gonna have to pretend I know what i'm doing (fake it till I make it pretty much)  
Just over two weeks ago, I made a profile on the main dating apps. I went in with low expectations, and those low expectations were met.  
On Tinder, I had 3 matches in the first week, but they never replied. Nothing since then.  
On Bumble, I've had 1 like, and no matches.  
On Hinge, I've had 4 matches, but only 1 girl replied. And then she stopped replying after her first message (and no, i haven't been using weird/creepy messages or really boring ones like ""hi"", lol).  
I also created accounts on POF and OkCupid, and had more likes on those, but I'm aware those apps have very bad reputations with likes coming from bots or people on the other side of the world, so I plan to delete these apps anyway.  
I'm also aware dating apps in general don't tend to work well for guys that are not in the top 1%, but I started this experiment because apparently that's how most people meet these days. The only other option would be to join clubs/activities using something like Meetup, but:  
a) there are no suitable meetup groups (i.e. those with people around my age attending) near me  
b) even if I were to find a suitable meetup group, I may never meet a girl there. So I'd waste even more of my 20s just hoping that someone is going to magically appear.  
As far as my looks are concerned, I don't think I'm ugly. Of course, I can't objectively rate my looks so I'd have to leave that to others. I'm in shape, well-groomed, and take care of myself. My biggest weakness is being 5'6"" (169cm). That never really bothered me until I started using these dating apps though, haha.

"I dislike dating I’m in a bit of a Catch-22 situation and could do with some perspectives on this. Be kind coz I’m rather sensitive at the moment. Here goes. It’s almost like I’ve stacked up all the odds against myself lol. The thing is, I dislike dating apps and dating. The whole charade of marketing yourself like you’re a product, donning a fancy dress to come off as aesthetically pleasing, and subjecting yourself to the judgment and scrutiny of a stranger doesn’t appeal to me. Not to mention the fact that I seem to be the Patron Saint of the desperate, duplicitous, and/or sociopathic type because those are usually the kind of blokes I end up meeting. And if it’s not that, then it’s guys who don’t have the qualities I’m looking for in the one specific man, neatly tied up with a bow, but a spattering of a few qualities in many men! And the fact that most men expect action after a number of dates fills me with much much trepidation. Coz if I’m hanging out with 4-5 men within the same time frame in an effort to get to know them all better as people, I’m supposed to suddenly start playing musical beds? No thanks. I’ve also tried attending hobby groups et al., and while I’ve made amazing friends along the way, I just haven’t met anyone I’d consider entering into a romantic liaison with. Darn it, why couldn’t I be a gorgeous woman who could have her pick from among the crème de la crème of men? Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy being my sassy, witty, perfectly ordinary-looking self but it’s so unfair how some women have it all by mere virtue of the fact that Aphrodite breathed in their direction while I’m left having to contend with candidates who are just not up to par. Add to this complex stew, the fact that I can’t/won’t settle for less coz exes have spoilt me rotten by setting a pretty high bar in terms of what I’d want in a man. And the fact that there has been a revolving door of friends and cousins who have finally found their future spouses doesn’t help any either. Stupid, pigheaded life/destiny/fate and its unwillingness to just have me run into the kinda guy I like, become friends, and then naturally/organically become a couple, so that I can once and for all be done with the entire drama of finding my Mr. Darcy.

"How and when do you stop feeling so jaded and bitter after being cheated on? It’s been five months since my last relationship ended. To provide some context, I was with a man that I was very very in love with but he cheated on me early on in the relationship which eventually blew up and I ended things. The shitty thing that really messed me up was he was able to disguise everything so well that I truly believed it was a great relationship and trusted him 100%. 

Ever since then I’ve just kinda lost hope in humanity I guess. Even when I look at happy families i immediately think, well who knows what’s going on behind the scenes. I’m conventionally attractive I’d say, so there’s no shortage of men, but I cannot seem to form any kinds of connection close to what I had before. Even when things go well, I immediately have the kinda thoughts of “well who tf knows what’s gonna happen. Even if people are happy at some point it all falls apart anyways. “  the thought of committing to a relationship just fills me with dread but I’m also not satisfied with emotionless situationships.

"Why would my bestfriend ask me on a date and never bring it up again? My (24F) bestfriend (25M) asked me out on a date a few weeks ago. We’ve hooked up years ago and it never ruined our friendship or made anything awkward. These last few months I felt something shift between us, and thought that feelings developed. We got so much closer and began talking all day long. He’s made a lot of jokes about us being in love, ending up together, etc and maybe it just gave me the wrong idea. I’m pretty sure I caught feelings. All our lives our family and friends swear we’re soulmates and claim we’re in love and I could never imagine that until now. He made it clear this was a DATE, not just us hanging out. He even planned it but we held off because I was away that week.

We had plans to see each other the weekend I got back (not for the date) but just to hangout like we usually do and he cancelled. I didn’t think much of it but he didn’t text me for a week. When he did reach out, there was no flirting or joking, and he never brought up the date again. Even if he doesn’t have feelings, as my bestfriend he normally speaks to me a lot more.

He choose the other person he was seeing to pursue a relationship with her and become her boyfriend. Im just sad and broken and i have no idea what to do. I was so venerable with this person, and I feel like if it wont work with my best friend it wont work with anyone. Never felt chosen and wanted.

I feel like the person I'm meant to be with is either with someone else or doesn't exist. I feel like it would happen by now. 

Im starting to get over it and want to date other people again. My friends have been my biggest support system and they have made me feel better over this sad time period. 

However, My biggest issue is getting back out there and dating people I don’t know either apps and meeting new people irl. Dating through apps hasnt worked out for me with cheating scandals and legit ended up with an extreme pregnancy scare. Ive also dated my guy friends and it lead to huge fallouts and pain. I do not believe in the friends to lovers trope anymore. 

I feel when dating unknown people they are only showing their best selves and hiding behind a mask. They won’t tell you the inside outs of themselves, and how they are like with their family and friends and personal issues ect. 

I prefer to be friends with someone and getting to know someone for who they are truthfully before jumping into anything (like to like the or to even be interested in dating). Emotional and sexual chemistry is very important to me (and I am a very sexual person which makes this harder for me).  
Please help what do I do! My friends tell me I should start getting back out there and date multiple people to figure out what I want but I’m terrified.

Anyway, during a normal conversation, he mentioned how I should find a guy that looks like him or “even better”. This comment hurt me a little but I brushed it aside. He then talked about how he’s not willing to put in the work for a relationship right now but is training to improve his social skills for when he meets his future wife. This didn’t sit right with me at all.

I also have friends they all have girlfriends and they ask me why I don't have any but I don't know I am just bad at texting or expressing my self through text to girls, I overthink It's just get awkard and very formal when I am texting a girl.

"I am not sure how to get to the next step with this girl Hey,  
  
I met this girl on Tinder, and we've had a couple of great outings together. We went for dinner, spent a day together, and even had a sleepover. We met up briefly once after that, but now I'm at a bit of a loss on how to proceed. I'm really interested in getting to know her better, but I'm struggling to figure out the right approach.  
  
So far, I've tried a few things to keep the connection going:  
  
I suggested meeting up after work, but she canceled, mentioning she was tired.  
I asked her out, but she had plans with her girlfriends.  
I proposed going to a concert for her favorite singer, but she explained she can't take too much time off work.  
I inquired about visiting her place, but she said she needed some alone time.  
I understand that her reasons are valid, and I genuinely respect her boundaries. I'm really eager to spend more time with her, and I've been considering asking if she'd like to hang out or grab a meal together today. If she declines this time, I'm thinking about taking a step back and not initiating any more plans. While she does respond to my messages, I've noticed that I seem more focused on spending time with her rather than having meaningful conversations.  
  
I want her to know that I'm interested in getting to know her on a deeper level, beyond just hanging out. I worry that I might come across as wanting to fuck her only, which is definitely not my main focus (I genuinely want to get to know her better).  
  
I've been pondering the idea of sending her some funny cat videos to lighten the mood and give us something to talk about. I'm not entirely sure if this is a good approach, though. Since we're still getting to know each other and not officially dating, I'm hesitant to bring up this topic directly as it might seem premature.  
  
I'd really appreciate any advice you could offer. How do I strike the right balance between showing my interest and having engaging conversations without overwhelming her?

"How to avoid gold-digging psycho Karens? Or is it a me issue? I think I was born in a different time. For context I'm 34 m a struggling doctor. Emphasis on struggling since my practice isn't great. My other jobs pay better believe me. I have a few businesses too. Financially I'm not where I want to be but I think I can manage. I was raised by my lola to always pay for both. She always taught all her male apos that if we cannot pay for 2, don't play. She will demand we open doors, assist ladies going down or up stairs and elevators, etc.  
  
So here's the thing. I have had my fair share of ons, fwbs and other mutliple partner arrangements. And I think I am at a point in my life where I want to have a peaceful life and start working on having a real relationship. My surname is the same as one rich politcal family but I am not related to them. I wish I was that rich so that money wouldn't be an issue. I do not mind picking the tab on dates, but lately I noticed that there are some that do take advantage.  
  
Typical scenario:  
  
I meet a girl. Treat her like how my lola taught us. We hit it off. Sex is really great. I'm considering of being exclusive with them. But before that happens, cracks begin to show, especially when I start caring for them. They start asking for a little help at first. Like nadukutan ako can you send this. So I would oblige and send gcash. I have a family emergency and I'll send again. And I notice this with girls in general, like there are no status ie financial or educational attainment indicators.  
  
When this start to happen I usually send them a goodbye text/chat or call; when ideal I tell them in person.  
  
Now the shitty part, they start raging, stalking and literally destroying some of my stuff. One time a girl I used to date slashed 4 of my tires.  
  
So here are my question:  
  
Is it me? Do I attract these kinds of women?  
  
If it's me then, what should I look out for?  
  
Am I too impatient that I ditch too early?  
  
Should I just accept that I am doomed to singledom and meaningless sex?  
  
Apologies for the lengthy post.

"Staying friends after breaking up: is it always a bad idea? I (early 20sF) dated a guy (mid 30sM) for around two months after having known each other for a year (but actively talked for much less than that). The relationship started out very intense, serious, we saw each other several days a week and then called every day we weren't together. We never said the L word out loud but we danced around it.

However, we ran into some issues that we didn't and don't know how to fix. I don't think he's completely over his ex and I'm pretty sure he has some trauma/baggage from his very complicated past relationships - which resulted in him being a little avoidant and anxious when it comes to commitment and expectations. I also have some baggage, which resulted in me needing constant reassurance. This caused some arguments. Other than that, we loved each other's company. 

After we broke up, we went no contact (his decision) for a few days until he caved and messaged me. This would happen twice. Now we've been talking consistently, as friends. However, we've met in person and the chemistry was still there, we both could feel it and it was... weird. We didn't kiss, but we kept touching each other the way we would back then. He still openly flirts with me at times but I've been holding back on that. 

However, we don't text when he goes out. And I can't ask who he's going out with - my mind keeps thinking it's another girl, that he's moved on, etc. And it shouldn't matter because we're not together, but it does. He also tries to check up on me and whether I've met someone; if I've watched x new movie with anyone already, and other probing questions. 

We both dislike the idea of not talking anymore. We miss and like and care for each other; but I think we're both dealing with intentions that are romantic, rather than just platonic. I don't know whether to go no contact until we have both moved on or wait until time takes care of these feelings that we have for one another.

I fear, though, that by keeping him in my life I'll hold myself back from meeting other people... because subconsciously I hope he'll eventually figure out we're right together, that things will be better. Etc.

I'll take any advice I can get and would like to hear about anyone that stayed friends with their exes, what happened, and the likes. Thank you!",thethrowaway4help,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kklo8/staying_friends_after_breaking_up_is_it_always_a/,1691414488.0,1.0

One day she was working at the bar and I sat there to have a drink. I started chatting with her and intentionally cut the conversation at some times to see if she is actually interested which seemed the case to me as she was interested in talking more with me. At the end I asked for her number and she said that she doesn’t give her phone number at work, which I completely understand and it is my fault for not handing my phone number to her. After that, she stayed being nice and offered me a complimentary drink and then I left. Do you think she did not give the phone number due to being at work ? Or she used that as an excuse to reject me ? I think me and that person could become something serious and I am even thinking of going back to the same hotel and wait until she finishes work so I can ask her out.",No_Willow_1321,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kqbqi/how_to_interpret_this_situation/,1691427444.0,1.0

"Should I give him a second chance? I met a guy on Bumble nearly two months ago and we have been primarily texting with a few voice messages and calls. We took a long time to get to know each other before a date. 

A couple weeks ago he asked me to meet for our first date. The night he chose didn’t work for me so we chose this past Saturday night. He asked me to choose the place and he would set everything up. Midweek last week I checked in on the details and he never confirmed fully saying the place is the same but the time could change. Kind of weird. On the day of I didn’t hear from him all day, so I checked in through text and asked for the details. I called and he didn’t pick up. When I hadn’t heard from him by 4 I knew it wasn’t happening. I was concerned there was an emergency. 

He texted me at 5:45 to tell me he had been on the road all day - the destination was 9 hours away from us - for work. I told him it would have been courteous for him to have told me. I would have scheduled my day differently. At that point I thought it would have been appropriate for an apology but all he said was “now that’s the case, what should I do?” I decided to not further debate or get entangled so I went to stay the night with a friend and went to the beach the next day where I didn’t have cell service.

In the meantime he texted to ask if I was alright, if I was angry, and finally asked why I was ignoring him. I responded that I was out of service. I told him that I was not alright, that I had been looking forward to the date, I was hurt that he didn’t update me, and that I felt like I didn’t matter to him. 

He again said he didn’t have time to tell me and that this is for our future. He was going to make a big commission. I asked him when he found out and when he left. He found out Saturday morning and left right away. I asked him if he made any stops for food or gas, implying that it would have been an occasion to have sent me a quick message. He said that he could tell I was mad so he wasn’t going to tell me and said “Don't worry, I'll make it up later and allow you to pat my ass twice.” 

At this point in time I was furious. I felt like he didn’t respect me or my time and that he didn’t actually apologize. I told him that, “when you said ""but now that's the case, what should I do?"" Honestly I thought apologizing was the appropriate thing to do. I think it would have helped me feel like you respect me and my time.” He told me this was an apology. 

I don’t feel like this is an apology. It’s not clear to me that he understands that I was hurt. I feel like he didn’t respect me - especially my time and feelings. I don’t feel like he took me seriously. If he had been kind and apologetic I would have felt differently and more open to a second chance. 

I’m not sure how to move forward. I gave myself permission to not figure it out right away. But I no longer feel excited by him and think he is putting off a-hole vibes. 

I would appreciate any advice. I an open to the fact that I could be overreacting.

"When will I heal? I dumped my gf over a year or so ago. I'm not hung up on her as they say. I had fun being with her and it was beautiful and I remember ut fondly but that's about it.

The problem. My ex was a rageaholic. Kind of. She was sarcastic too insecure about herself. She would always take her anger on me. Always indirectly insult me. Sarcasm was her middle name. Plus it was a 1 sided relationship I got tired of carrying and blah blah blah, I dumped her ass.

We dated for 2 years. This attitude was there from the start. (Yeah, people say I have the patience of a saint.) I feel hurt. Lately I've been feeling like this wound is turning into a scar. I accept the situation and how crappy of a gf she was and how she got worse after being dumped by me. Like dudes. She was insulting me minutes before I gently suggested to break up. I never ever retaliated or took my anger on her. My middle name was ""unsuccesful deescalation"" 

All of that is the past. But after a year, I hurt everyday from it. Not from the breakup itself. Rather, this... Treatment she gave me. I hate throwing down the word ""abuse"" but maybe this is a smaller form of it. I recently met with a cousin of mine that just so happened to look like her. And whenever I was around my cousin, I felt as though she was going to yell at me or berate me. Simply because she looks like her (my cousin wouldn't hurt a fly.) 

So what I want to ask. What the hell is going on with me? 

I want to begin the new chapter of my life. I'd like to find love again. But I'm not going to allow myself that until this stops hurting. It wouldn't be fair.

"Is it fair to suffer just for being truthful? 

A lonely gay guy from Bangalore. I was in a lot of confusion when I was young so I didn't really made any friends.

When I came to work, I had some understanding about myself and the internet helped me understand it better.

When I discovered I'm gay and greysexual it was a big thing for me and I was excited. I really believed there are many guys like me out there.

But when I started looking online for hangout or cuddle buddies, the response was bad. All the conversations lasted only few minutes and it was either to understand my sexuality or convince me to try new things.

I slowly started loosing hope. I just keep on imagining if I'm in a bad environment or everyone online are bad. The problem is it's too difficult to understand if a guy is interested in hanging out in real world.

And being in a heteronormal society, even asking a guy outside in friendly manner seems weird for others.

"[30 F] [35M] is he just not attracted or interested in me? 



 I’m constantly rejected and can anticipate that the guys who are showing me attention online will eventually lose interest (if you can call it that) and lead me on/reject me. 

This is my question. I was talking to a guy who I was attracted to (he was attractive.. he could literally get any girl) . 

He asked me out and we did go out because I guess we have a lot in common…. 

Long story short he left unexpectedly to move closer to his family. We kind of talked in and off but that stopped. We ended up discussing casual after he left and we tried to meet up once but he admitted he was trying to get over a break up and we stopped talking. I kind of got upset and said something about it to him and later apologized 

I reached out regarding being friends said that he saw it as unrealistic. I’m assuming he doesn’t like me any capacity or attracted to me at all? 

To end this story, I noticed he’s been liking my social media stuff? Why is he doing that if we’ve had no contact? After I apologized to him after we’ve had no communication with each other. 

And how come he hasn’t deleted me? 

Anyways, is he just not attracted or interested in me? Or is it just that he’s there and I’m here and he already said he doesn’t want distance, doesn’t see friends as realistic due to distance and isn’t feeling casual?

"No luck on dating since ever Hi people.
First time Im posting something like this, but I feel like the advices I am getting from my friends dont help me out that much.

I am kinda in a bad state when it comes to dating. I am a 31 years old gay guy and never had a relation. I had around 30 dates in my life and noone of them ever got into something serious. They end up in ghosting, friendzoning or it just not working out (most of the times I dont get the real reason, just some ""i say somrthing nice so I dont hurt you reason"".

This year I had dates with 5 different people. 2 friendzoned me but I ended uo being real good friends with them, 1 ghosted me after 3 amazing dates and 2 decided they were not ready for something serious after a few dates.

I am really tired of dating apps, but never in my life has someone talked to me in reallife.

I am good looking (in my opinion), I have a very open and good personality, have no problems making friends or talking to new people, have my life under control, I am stable in terms of psychology (did a year of therapy because I used to hslave depression and it changed my life so much) a stable job, good friends and an amazing family. Im super happy with my life, yet I still feel like Im missing someone on my side who I can share everything with and talk about everything.

Last person who dumped me was yesterday, I am not sure if its the best option to start dating straight away again, since I am still a bit sad about it, yet I still want to get to know somebody.

I would love to hear about similar experiences, opinions or just some good words to get over this little pain a bit quicker.

"As someone struggling to get into the dating scene, one thing I have a huge insecurity about is that I'm almost 30 and still live with my parents (not entirely by choice). How weird does that seem? First and foremost I must explain that I am saving up money to move out. I have a full time job and I've been putting all my cash tips that I make into a savings account since I started that job just a little over a year ago. Now I have about $4000 in that savings account. And it's all for moving expenses like the down payment on an apartment, furniture and other utilities I'd need. 

That being said, I still feel like a loser piece of shit that I haven't moved out. I'm 29 and I still live with my parents. I feel like any woman who had any interest in me (which is rare to begin with) would be instantly turned off by learning I don't have my own place. I'm not looking for one night stands, I want to meet someone and make a connection that grows over time and becomes a real relationship. But I feel like no woman would want to invest their time in me if I'm not living on my own. It'd be one thing if I was younger. But I'm at a point in my life where I feel like I haven't achieved enough and I'm lagging behind. I feel like shit about it. The cost of living is crazy high and I am having a hard time finding a place in my area that I could afford on my own, along with all my other expenses like car payments, phone bill, gas, groceries, etc. 

So how weird is it that I'm in this situation? How do I approach the subject? If I'm asked if where I live, how should I answer?",selfdoubt5421,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kmfp0/as_someone_struggling_to_get_into_the_dating/,1691418813.0,1.0
"Struggling to find relationship m20 So I’ve never been in a relationship and I have been on and off dating apps for the past two years with no luck. I would say I’m either average looking or just below and having a good all around personality. On dating apps it’s hard to get matches let alone replies and it seems as though if I don’t formulate the perfect reply they’ll never message back. Talking to girls I’m fine about, but I’m way too scared to talk to a girl and ask for their contact details for the reason of that I think they’ll find me weird or creepy or they’ll accept but don’t really want to talk because of the normal stereotypes of men approaching woman. Ofc I wouldn’t be like that but still hard to get past . I don’t go to bars or clubs which I know is a good way to meet new people.

I looked at it more as, I do like this girl, she's going to be here, it'd be nice to bring her to this wedding and it'd be fun.

But on the day of the date she told me that she has an foot injury so she couldn’t go. Then we rescheduled it to a week later. The week later she cancelled again because she still had that foot injury and it didn’t improve. She said to me that she will text me when she feels better. 

The thing is I asked her if the foot injury wasn’t just an excuse and that she didn’t want to go anymore. She told me that that wasn’t the case  and that she would tell me upfront if she didn’t want to go and that she would text me.  

The thing is that I have been waiting like 8 days already for her to text me. But she still has not texted me or let anything know. And the time between our last date and now is about 4 weeks so it is getting longer and longer.

"I'm Done Approaching Women. I am going to vent, but my tone isn't an angry one. Just disappointed (in myself to a high degree).

I could start by saying that I always wanted a wife, but that's lame and somewhat obvious. So here's the real beginning: approaching women is an absolute chore (and it SHOULDN'T be). Why do I even have to do the approaching? I do what all of the ""gigachads"" do: keep good hygiene, work on people skills, dress my best, etc. It never works... at all (unless you look like gigachad Adonis or whoever the seasonal male celebrity is).

I hate it when so many people ask me ""why are you still single?"" Geez, if I knew, I wouldn't be single... Maybe it has something to do with my physical appearance. I'm in shape, sure, but I am 5'8"" and I got the face of an old man (I'm 19 and soooo many people think I'm the DAD of my 15 year old brother 💀). Maybe it's because I don't have the ""charisma"" or ""charm"" like Chris Hemsworth. Maybe my accent/voice sucks (okay, it does). Maybe my financial status being quite lackluster (not a millionaire) is the problem. I don't know, man. 

Every time I approached a woman, they'd get bored and leave. I know I didn't say anything wrong. I just don't say anything super hot or use pick up lines like some billionaire playboy philanthropist. I try to introduce myself and start some conversations, but they are NEVER interested. It's like they are always tuned out when I say ""hello."" I don't start off with the same generic line with every girl. I try to be normal and approachable. No woman approaches me, and I cannot approach them, apparently. Even the girls who actually share common interests, don't want to talk about said interests with me. Really shows how ugly, how boring, how unattractive I really am. I listened to all of the ""charismatic masters"" or whatever, and they can't solve my problem. I'm sick of getting let down and having my confidence blown to the freaking ground, all because I am single yet keep getting rejected by every girl in existence.

"How to stop overthinking AND when to communicate you need transparency? I’m 25F and every time I’ve tried to date someone, I’m constantly overthinking things and over analyzing things.

If a guy is active on social media but won’t text me when he’s on his phone, something is wrong. 

If I ask a guy when I can see him next, am I being too desperate? Too much? Too anxious?

These are all things that I struggle with plus my lack of experience dating.

I’m not one that easily goes with the flow of things and let things happen. I’ve always been an over thinker. I know I have anxiety and anxious attachments from my fear of being abandoned and not being good enough.

"Amazing 5th date, but he hasn’t texted me after? I’ve been seeing a guy (M28) since early June.  We’ve been on 5 dates, the last one being last Thursday. He has no trauma or mental illness (a first for me dating someone like this lol) and seems to display a secure attachment. He’s not overly verbally affectionate but he shows it in other ways, plus I think he might be shy or maybe he thinks it’s too soon. 

During our dates so far, he is a perfect gentleman, really attentive, listens to me, seems genuinely interested in my life and very physically romantic. While I’ve been extremely anxious with previous partners before, I don’t think I’ve ever been this attracted to anyone ever. He opens the door for me and serves me food first, things like that I’ve never had. However, I find his texting style to be very frustrating. He seems to not reach out immediately after our dates which my anxious attachment reads as disinterest. He will take 2 days after a date to reach out. However its been 3 days since our last date and he still hasnt reached out :( 

In July I went to Europe for holiday for 3 weeks and we sort of stopped talking because we hadn’t had a discussion about exclusivity so I understand that he wanted to give me space so I could have a summer where I wasn’t tied down to anyone. We did text here and there but not overly so. When I came back from Europe 2 weeks ago, I reached out to him on Instagram to ask “How are you?“ He responded positively and said that he wanted to hear my travel stories and we organised a date for last Thursday.

The date was wonderful. He cooked me dinner and we talked for ages. He remembered our convos from Hinge from 2 months ago, like remembering my fave restaurant and a discussion about an American beer commercial. And because it was the first time I’d seen him in 6 weeks, our physical chemistry was off the charts. He complimented my dress and after sex he said that he was so shy to make a move on me. I slept over and we cuddled all night. He even snoozed his alarm 3 times so he could sleep next to me longer. When he got ready for work he kissed me and said “See you later.” Which implies a future date?? 

Which leads me to ask why he hasnt reached out since then?? I’m just so confused bc our dates are literally perfect but he doesnt show that by reaching out to me? Even something like “how was your weekend?” would’ve sufficed. I know that I should text HIM but I feel like I’ve verbally confirmed many times that I like him and I just wanted validation that he likes me. Ugh I’m just an anxious mess right now.

"[30 F] [35M] is he just not attracted or interested in me? 


 I’m constantly rejected and can anticipate that the guys who are showing me attention online will eventually lose interest (if you can call it that) and lead me on/reject me. 

This is my question. I was talking to a guy who I was attracted to (he was attractive.. he could literally get any girl) . 

He asked me out and we did go out because I guess we have a lot in common…. 

Long story short he left unexpectedly to move closer to his family. We kind of talked in and off but that stopped. We ended up discussing casual after he left and we tried to meet up once but he admitted he was trying to get over a break up and we stopped talking. I kind of got upset and said something about it to him and later apologized 

I reached out regarding being friends said that he saw it as unrealistic. I’m assuming he doesn’t like me any capacity or attracted to me at all? 

To end this story, I noticed he’s been liking my social media stuff? Why is he doing that if we’ve had no contact? After I apologized to him after we’ve had no communication with each other. 

And how come he hasn’t deleted me? 

Anyways, is he just not attracted or interested in me? Or is it just that he’s there and I’m here and he already said he doesn’t want distance, doesn’t see friends as realistic due to distance and isn’t feeling casual?

"Realizing I’m a Tender Heart This past weekend I’ve went on my first date in six months. I met this woman on an app. Very quickly she became my favorite person. We enjoyed all the same things and it was refreshing talking to someone who didn’t make everything about themselves. After hooking up, I made a terrible mistake by being insecure about my sexual performance through text. My past sexual trauma ties into this. I’m very upset that after all the therapy and personal work I reverted back to my old self. 

Yesterday, she didn’t text me and actively avoided my IG story. We talked everyday and shared at least 2000+ messages until this point. I know it’s my fault for treating this situation bigger than it is. I accepted that the connection is over between us. I’m realizing now that I’m looking for something more than just casual sex. I’m glad that I know that about myself now. I thought that I could hang with the City Boys but I’m a CLB 😂. My heart is definitely not built for this meta and I’m going to need a few weeks to myself.

"TLDR: My boyfriend felt rejected when I didn't want to hook up, started talking with an accent and literally became a different person. Then broke up with me. I (35/F) just had the weirdest weekend with my (35/M) now ex-boyfriend and a friend. My friend invited me camping for the weekend and said I could bring my boyfriend along. We met on Tinder. On our first date we discussed what we were looking for, long term relationship. After dinner he proceeded to invite me to his place for wine, which I declined. I mentally put him in the looking for a hookup category. Over the next few weeks he would invite me to do things frequently, so I gave him a chance. Four weeks in we had the ""What are we"" conversation and established that we were exclusively dating having now become physical. A month goes by and things are really good. We have open discussions about past relationships and how they shaped us, thoughts on men and women being just friends, check ins on how we're feeling. We meet each others friends. There were normal new relationship hiccups, that now seem like red flags. He was upset that I still spent time with my friends without/instead of him. He constantly ""joked"" about me having commitment issues. I brought up how him constantly bringing it up doesn't feel like a joke and reassured him I was invested in a relationship and wanted to see how we could grow together. 

It started going downhill a week ago, when he asked if he was better than my ex. I guess he was looking for me to tell him he was the most amazing person I've ever met. I told him I don't think its fair to compare people because everyone is different, and every relationship was different. I would only compare him to himself and how he treats me based on what we've discussed. He didn't like that. He completely shut down, after telling me I was wrong and that I was lying and that he knew I compared him to other people I've dated. I gave him space that night. We got cookies and watched tv. He went home. Next time I saw him I brought it up. I told him he seems to withdraw when he feels rejected, and that it was not my intention. I told him he weaponizes affection, which he denied. I pointed out that after I wouldn't tell him he was better than my ex he did not touch me. No hand holding, no cuddles, barely a hug goodbye. 

A few days later we go on our camping trip. Things seemed fine. He was excited, we talked like normal leading up to Friday. We picked up my friend after work and everything was great. We get set up at our campsite by 8:30pm. We started a fire and made smores, but the wood was wet and the fire died pretty quickly. So to bed we went about 930. We lay and talk and cuddle and he makes a move. I said, not tonight, I'm really tired from preparing for this trip. He said fine, and immediately rolled over. I told him just because I don't want to have sex, doesn't mean you have to ignore me. Which led to a fight. And boy did it escalate.. He ranted about women not being able to communicate and being difficult to date. And that women ghost men way more than the other way around. That all of his female friends complain about guys not communicating but they must be terrible at picking mates. When I told him I agree that men don't typically communicate feelings or life events well he asked for an example. I told him a situation with an ex (that he already knew about) and I made the mistake of saying ""To this day"". He then said ""OOOH, it all makes sense now, you still have feelings for other people."" I asked where that came from and he said if you're still talking to an ex you must still have feelings. I felt like he was putting words in my mouth. I also brought up the fact we had talked about some of my ex's being ""friends"" in that every few months we might say hello and hope you're doing ok. He was fine with it and said that some of his female friends are in his life because he tried to sleep with them and was turned down. 

The craziest part is **HE STARTED TALKING WITH AN ACCENT!** A really country accent. Me being tired thought I was hearing things. I asked where the accent came from and he said it comes out sometimes, like when he drinks. In the past two months we had drinks together, including on his birthday where his friends were buying him shots. Not once did he speak with a country accent. He also turned into the most cynical person. Typically he's upbeat and positive. I would joke about being an old lady and hating the world these days and his response would always be, but there are so many new experiences to have and people to meet. Friday night in the tent, he went on a rant about hating people and never wanting to expand his friend group because they are great and people suck. After 2 hours of this I told him I felt we were at an impasse and should sleep on it and revisit this discussion. I felt like I was talking to a completely different person. Saturday he would go from touchy feely normal behavior, to wandering around the campground alone and not wanting to be bothered. We tried playing a get to know you game and even my friend noticed his behavior was completely different than before. 

Today he got up at 6am and packed all of his stuff into the car. My friend and I got up at 7 since he had been making so much noise and started packing. We ate breakfast, he refused to join and wandered off. We cleaned up and packed the car. I texted him, since he hadn't returned, that he seemed ready to leave so we were packed and ready. He came back and said ""I'm not rushing you, you guys can go swim, have fun."" We left at 8:30. We rode in silence as he blasted heavy metal/screamo/angsty music. The closer we got to my friend's house the more upbeat the music became, even played some Britney Spears. We dropped my friend off and headed back to his apartment where my car was. He pulled behind my car and piled all my stuff in the parking lot. I had my driver door open while trying to put stuff away. He decides to back into the parking spot next to me. So I got in the car to close the door. He knocked on the window and said, ""Are you not going to say goodbye, just going to leave me."" I got out and explained I just didn't want him to hit my door. He said thanks for inviting me, half hugged me and turned around to untie his kayak. I stood there confused, like are we not going to talk about what just happened. So I got in my car and left. 10 minutes later he texted me saying, ""You seemed like you were in a hurry so I didn't get to talk to you. I don't think I'm what you're looking for."" I told him he turned into a completely different person and I would agree, good luck.",Hungry-Hippo-6607,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k39ux/tldr_my_boyfriend_felt_rejected_when_i_didnt_want/,1691362543.0,0.77

"Woman asked me to pick her up on first meet up or provide transportation to location. Got upset when I said no and cursed me out. Do you pick up your date on a first date ? Matched with this lady on hinge like 4 days ago. Conversation was okay, she would text back like 8-9 hours later and it would always be about how she was busy at work. Never got to ask what she did. Anyways, on Friday during a convo  I jokingly said it sounds like she needs a like a drink due to her work life. She immediately asked if I was offering to take her out for a drink. I wasn’t offering and thought this was kinda odd. But I actually wanted to go out for a drink so I did ended up offering. 

She tells me she’s free that night (gives me no specific time) and ask where we’re going. I tell her and she doesn’t respond for like 8 hours. Night comes and I’m at home relaxing playing video games. I forget about the plans and honestly think it wasn’t happening. I get a text from her at almost 9 pm. I tell her the place closes at 11 and if she’d be down to go somewhere else.


I send her the location and to tell me when she’s getting ready to leave. She ask me if I could pick her up or send an Uber and to see if we could go somewhere else since she ain’t like the new place I suggested. 

I told her I don’t pick people up on the first dates/or provide transportation due to safety and her being a stranger.  She also lived like 45 minutes away. So I would have to pick her up from her location, head back to our destination and drop her home when we could just meet in between. Anyways, she cussed me out saying I wasn’t a “real man” and other types of nonsense. Never responded. She blocked my number and unmatched after that lol.

"[30 F] [35M] is he just not attracted or interested in me? 

 I’m constantly rejected and can anticipate that the guys who are showing me attention online will eventually lose interest (if you can call it that) and lead me on/reject me. 

This is my question. I was talking to a guy who I was attracted to (he was attractive.. he could literally get any girl) . 

He asked me out and we did go out because I guess we have a lot in common…. 

Long story short he left unexpectedly to move closer to his family. We kind of talked in and off but that stopped. We ended up discussing casual after he left and we tried to meet up once but he admitted he was trying to get over a break up and we stopped talking. I kind of got upset and said something about it to him and later apologized 

I reached out regarding being friends said that he saw it as unrealistic. I’m assuming he doesn’t like me any capacity or attracted to me at all? 

To end this story, I noticed he’s been liking my social media stuff? Why is he doing that if we’ve had no contact? After I apologized to him after we’ve had no communication with each other. 

And how come he hasn’t deleted me? 

Anyways, is he just not attracted or interested in me? Or is it just that he’s there and I’m here and he already said he doesn’t want distance, doesn’t see friends as realistic due to distance and isn’t feeling casual? Or maybe that’s all BS but would be different if I was attractive to him??",ThrowRAbikiniblonde,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kibj9/30_f_35m_is_he_just_not_attracted_or_interested/,1691408584.0,1.0

"I canceled a date two hours before the time because I hadn’t heard from him today. He is upset. I had a first date with someone that we planned yesterday. I texted him earlier today (11 AM) to confirm that we still had a date but his notifications were silenced. 

I texted him two hours before meet time “Hey I haven’t heard from you today so I think we should cancel.”.

He texts me an hour later (1 hr before) like oh no I’m on way. And he’s like upset like “I’m only ten minutes away……” and he called me like “I just pulled off the freeway. Are you really not coming?” I told him yes, and let him know I texted him an hour ago saying I think we should cancel and he was like “I haven’t been looking at my phone I’ve been busy and getting ready… should I just go home?” And then he sends “I mean it’s not like we still can’t do something. But whatever just sucks I essentially drove half way there and got ready and everything for nothing.”

My thing is.. who doesn’t check their texts before leaving for a date? What if something happened? And also doesn’t having your notifications silenced all day scream suspicious? Did I do anything wrong here or was it right to cancel?

Edit to add: I didn’t want to text him all day. I had barely communicated with this person at all and it was a last minute plan. He was texting me quite a bit yesterday while I was out shopping and let me know he was going to a party. I said okay have fun etc. And no word at all today.

"I Could use some advice on what to do next or to even do something at all Let me start by giving you some context about the current situation. A month or two ago I matched with someone through Tinder. During our conversations she mentioned that she had recently recovered from cancer, this is some information for later in the story. Our conversations went well, so well that she soon suggested we do something together. I immediately suggested a date in the next week, but then she would be on vacation with her parents. The weeks after that couldn't be either, she had to stick to a strict diet for her last full body scan, before this scan she would have to take radioactive iodine. She was adviced to avoid people getting within 2 meters of her for two weeks. So finally I said we would see how or what in the following week.  
  
In all that time in between, we did have some conversations, but not a huge amount, because for me that time was also incredibly busy. In the last week off her no contact advice we talked and agreed on a date, but a day before the date I got a message. In this message she told me that the weekend before she had met another man with whom it clicked well, so she didn't think it was a good idea to meet up. I said I was disappointed but wished her luck and told her that if it didn't work out with the other guy, she could send me a message.  
  
After two and a half weeks, I got a message from her. It had turned out to be nothing with the other man. I did ask when they decided not to go through with it. If she had been rejected recently by him, I would not have agreed, because I am better than a rebound. But, this was not the case and she had been thinking about it for around a week. I told her we would make an appointment the next day, because I was at a party. She was very happy that I was still open to still dating her and was very exicited to go on a date.  
  
The following week we went on a date and it went well and we laughed a lot. We gave each other a hug and went home. On the way home, she immediately started messaging, which I saw as a good sign. After a day, I texted her, eventually asking if she wanted to do something again. She indicated that she would like to do something again. I then tried to immediately agree on a next date, but that didn't work out.  
  
After a few days I texted her again, with an idea of what we could do and then I also suggested a date. I did start to notice around this time that there was a little longer between her responses. I didn't mention this to her of course, it was just something I noticed. A few days before the second date she sent me a short message in which she indicated that she was not feeling well at all and that this was why she reacted so late and briefly. I indicated that I could understand and then said that I would cancel the workshop (second date), because it is no fun for her and me to go when her head is not in the right place. We did continue talking for a while after that because I didn't want to end the conversation in a negative way.  
  
Now it has been about a week since our last contact and I have started thinking about the whole situation again, maybe a little too much, which is why I am here now. Looking back, I did have to be the one to often start the contact and take the initiative and I wonder if it is smart to do this again now. If I now start messaging her again to ask how she is doing and to see if a new date can be planned, I think it will come across as needy. I am getting the feeling her attraction is lowering but that could just be me overthinking the situation. I'm not sure what to think because her behaviour could be influnced by her medication en current situation.  
  
What do you guys think about the whole situation, did I do the right thing so far and what do you think is the best next step? Send her a message to ask how things are going or stay at arm's length for a while and let her approach me?

"How do I figure out what I want? And then what? I'm giving some background because it's relevant and important, but I'll try to keep this from turning into my life story. I'm a 32 year old single guy. I grew up very religious and sheltered. Didn't even go to public school until 8th grade. This I believe lead to stunted social skills. I was never comfortable talking to my family about dating or sex. At 14 when I was in 8th grade my mom told me I wasn't allowed to date until I was at least 17. I didn't see a point to trying to get a gf, after all what girl would want to date a guy who can't even tell his parents about her. After 17 I still felt too awkward about the subject to bring it up, so no girlfriend high school for me. I did however lose my virginity the summer I was 18 while staying/working away from home. Fast forward to 22 years old. I was a college drop out drug dealer at this point. Still never had a gf and had only been with the one girl. I had plenty of friends/hang abouts who were girls but I never understood to make the jump from friend/acquaintance to girlfriend ( I still don't). One day one of my customers, a 45 year old women, txt me asking to have sex. She ended up being my first girlfriend. About the first 6 months was great, followed by 4 years of misery. I left and swore I'd never get into a live in relationship again ( I haven't). Since then I've enjoyed being single and independent. I love living alone, not having to worry about other people's needs and feelings. It feels good to be selfish and just do whatever I want. I've improved myself, education, career, family relations, ect. That being said I don't think I want to spend the rest of my life without anyone at all. My question is how do I find out what I want with so little experience? It seems women want you to know this before hand and I don't want to waste someone else's time as well as my own. I at least know that I don't want marriage/ living together (need my own space), or kids ( child support and baby mama drama, no thanks). Should I try to find something long term with someone who doesn't want to live together? Should I just date causally. And how/where do I even meet women in the first place?

"Dating a broke and anxious girl I (24M) have been dating this girl (21F) for about a month. I work as a software engineer and have my finances in place. I am very attracted to her and want a relationship.

The problem is that she is doesn’t have a job (because of anxiety) and is broke. She is working on it, going to a public therapy once a week. She doesn’t go to school, doesn't know what she wants to do and doesn't know when she’ll have a stable job.

I pay for all the dates and we go on cheap places. I always pick her up since she doesn’t have a car and license.

What I like about her is that she’s easy going, never complains and makes me calm.

Lately, she said she didn’t want to have sex, because of past trauma (we did have sex once). I feel like this thing we have is one sided where now she doesn’t bring much to the table.

Should I break it off? I first made the “gamble” to see where she would end up with her work life, but not having sex is another big hit.

EDIT : Thanks for all the input guys ! I am trying to read them all but there`s a lot lol. A bit more context as to why I decided to date her knowing her anxiety is that I never felt so attracted to someone before. Granted I`ve only started dating 6 months ago and I am still learning, but I never thought someone so attractive can be attracted to me (she said that she never found someone that attractive as well).

"Is it an official red flag or what ? I (26M) met a girl on Tinder, and we went out with her cousin for our first date. After that, we started talking and went on two more dates. I really like her, and she feels the same way about me. However, there's a major obstacle in our potential relationship – she doesn't live in the same country. That was a significant concern for me as I don't usually do long-distance relationships. Nonetheless, she is determined to live in the same country and is currently applying for jobs here. We came to an agreement that if everything goes well after one year, we will move in together, regardless of the location, as long as we can be together.  
  
Two days ago, we went out with her sister, cousin, and a friend from her hometown. During the night, she seemed to ignore me, as she was catching up with her long-time friend. I didn't mind as much since they probably missed each other and had a lot to talk about. However, I tried to make an effort to have eye contact and talk to her, but we didn't engage in much conversation. Instead, I ended up having more conversations with her sister and cousin, which felt strange to me.  
  
After that, I sensed something was off on my side. I had opened up my heart to her, something I hadn't done in the past five years with anyone else I dated. I feel that she is no longer making the same effort, and I mostly initiate conversations and send pictures of what I am doing. I even suggested that if she misses me, she should call me, but she hasn't done so yet, even though she promised she would when she got home 2 days ago when she was out.  
  
Normally, I consider long-distance relationships a red flag, and I tend to avoid dating girls who live more than 35 minutes away from me. It's just a preference of mine. Despite that, I decided to give this girl a chance and opened my heart to her. Now, I'm feeling regretful about my decision and fear that I may end up getting hurt again.

"Trying to get back on the dating scene after getting wrecked (25F) The last time I was actively on dating apps and in the dating scene was probably right out of college. For some reason I got really ambitious and was dating and going on dates on a weekly/monthly basis. However I did begin to realize how much I was not ready for that and didn’t really handle those situations gracefully…

I think that I have slightly improved since then (I’m lying to myself). I started just settling for going out with a bang having one night stands where I would likely never see the person again. I messed up when I agreed to see the guy I had a one night stand with a year before and it ended in ultimate disaster, as I would have expected. It lasted about a month before he decided to move on and claimed to be in love with someone else. 

Things have been an absolute catastrophe since I graduated college and I have been a big part of it. I met a guy I thought would be forever and then 5 months later got diagnosed with bipolar. I have made so many reckless moves since then, including moving cross country on my own. Some people would say making mistakes is the fun part of your twenties. Trust me it has been entertaining, but I realized in the past year or so while dealing with family/job/life troubles that I would really like to have someone by my side to support me. It was really hard going through all that alone, and none of the past relationships checked up on me after my move or ever again at that. Granted, I did put myself in that position. But it made me rethink a lot of things. That is a terrible feeling and I don’t want to feel that way again. 

I realize now after going through a perpetual victim cycle for awhile expecting these people that I cut things off with to suddenly appear in my life without me even communicating with them that something was going on. I struggle with asking for support and I’m more the “suffer in silence” type. I’m a Scorpio moon so I would blame it on that. It’s only cinematically tragic until it’s real life drastic for your mental health. I have to actually put myself out there in every sense of the word if I am going to make connection and establish a support system. 

My mental health has been up and down for years. But now that I’m 25, things are kind of starting to settle in. It’s either going to get harder, easier, or stay disappointingly the same. At this point, it’s looking like I will either spend the next several years of my life in my apartment with my dog (on the surface doesn’t sound that bad). Or I will finally put myself out there again and through trial and error hopefully find a group of people that support me and hopefully a partner as well. But transitioning from being alone most of the time and struggling really badly with my mental health to assimilating with society is overwhelming.

Me (22f) and my bf (31m) has been dating and living together for half an year. There were some friend we knew for long time betrayed us by trying to tear us apart and manipulating us. Therefore, we went to another country hope to heal the pain. However, I have never been to that place before and the culture-shock suffered me as well. Also, the financial situation is not as stable as before because we could not earn money there. The network was pretty shitty so it was hard to try to do things online to make money too. In the trip, I did not know he wad overwhelmed so I told him something about my terrible upbringing and got raped before. Also, the last few days of the trip he has to reduce his setraline dosage because he did not bring enough to overseas. We were seeking online therapy at that point, but I guess he was too depressed to share his true feelings. Therapy did not really work out. We had some terrible arguement when we were in overseas. He said that me screaming or shouting really traumatized him and made our romance level decreased after we came back to our hometown.

After all the things happened, we still hold on to hope that our relationship can be fixed.

However, today his depression even got worse. He says that he does not know what is right or wrong anymore. I do not know what distance between me and him can make him comfortable. 

I really wanna fix things with him and company him through this depression journey. Is there anything you would recommand me to do or books to read to help me understand him more?

"Randomly Blocked on Instagram, looking for an understanding Let me preface that this was a casual holiday fling from a few months ago. But she seemed to specifically plan this block and it is causing me confusion, so I wanted to get a girls perspective.

I met this girl on Tinder when travelling in a different continent a few months ago, she was from the country and visiting this particular island. We had a great 1st date, and then hung out again a couple weeks later when I visited her city as part of my trip. Then gave me a ride to the next city I was visiting which was just 1 hour away.

The dates were good, we had fun, slept together and so on. During general chat on the 2nd date she did say ‘I think we would be good as friends rather than bf/gf, let’s have fun tonight for sure, but I think we would be better as friends’. I was fine with that, I live in another continent and while she was very attractive and nice, I didn’t see us as a perfect match necessarily.

Any ways I went back to Europe and got on with my regular life. Not gonna lie, I was thinking about her quite a bit. However…. I was not contacting her much at all. I replied to a couple of her Instagram stories, we connected on Facebook, and we both liked some of our posts that we uploaded in subsequent months.

She got into a relationship (1 or 2 of her FB posts made it obvious). I did write to her on Whatsapp a couple of months ago asking how is everything etc. She never wrote back, so obviously I didn’t make any attempt to contact her again and deleted her number. I presumed she would unfollow or block me then perhaps, but she did like a couple of my Instagram /stories posts over the next few weeks.

Last Sunday, I noticed she had blocked me on Instagram, I could tell as her page showed up in a general google search. I presumed she would have done the same on Facebook but I was not blocked there. A few days later it showed both her facebook and Instagram accounts as deactivated. My obvious conclusion at this stage was that she had deactivated both her accounts.

**However, her facebook was showing up again today. But her Instagram wasn’t. I created another quick profile on Instagram, and she was searchable on that… but not on mine.**

**Therefore, it appears that she blocked me, then deactivated her social media pages to maybe make me believe she was just taking a break from social media…. before re-activating them. Not sure why she hasn’t just blocked me on FB, maybe she forgot we were connected there.**

I’m confused and somewhat let-down.

Sure it was just a holiday fling, but she is the type of girl who I would have liked to have stayed in touch with. Yes she had a new boyfriend, but again, I literally only texted her once asking how life was. And that was 2 months ago.

**My only fearful conclusion is that she maybe figured I was crushing on her via her Instagram activity. Let’s face it, we all enjoy looking at our crush on Instagram. There seems to be some anecdotal evidence and speculation that story ranking viewers is dictated by who interacts with your profile the most, including viewing the profile.... and she probably got paranoid when she saw me appear at the top on a consistent basis. This is quite possibly it and I'm definitely going to be more vigilant about this moving forward.**

Of course she has a new boyfriend and maybe she got paranoid that I would re-appear on the scene or ask about meeting up travelling again, which she would have to decline. But if she was thinking along those lines, I don’t get why she just decided to block me randomly when I wasn’t even contacting her.

I am never going to contact her again in any shape or form, even if we remain connected on Facebook. A block is a block, and ‘no means no’. But I would just like to hear your thoughts on this one.",letsgetitsolved201,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kgtb0/randomly_blocked_on_instagram_looking_for_an/,1691404285.0,0.5
"New to dating - 22m Hi all,

I am a 22m with no dating experience and recently I have felt that I want to get into the dating world.

I have never dated before and I am feeling like I am a bit old now. I am feeling the pressure considering that I only have a year of university left and I focused so much of the first 3 years just studying.

The only issue I have is that I feel that I am running out of time because I am only really starting to focus on improving myself outside of studies and career. I am working as a undergrad engineer and going to classes.

I understand I need to focus on improving myself which is why I am starting a new diet, gym routine and Invisalign. Also looking to work on my own startup.

But how do you stop the feeling of anxiety seeing all your friends making steps in this area well ahead of me. I feel like I focused on my career too early and now don’t have time to focus on these things considering losing weight, etc are a lengthy process in of itself.

Some advice would be greatly appreciated",plop786,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kabpz/new_to_dating_22m/,1691382732.0,1.0
"Am I being rejected? Hello,

I am 33M, and have been on a Tinder date a week ago with 29F. We matched and arranged a date last minute on a Saturday, the date was great and we ended up back at her place. We had oral sex.

She went on a vacation for a couple of days and came back. During that time, I initiated communication 3 times. I asked her out yesterday and she said she just didn't feel like it. The messaging is sort of one sided, even though she does respond well to my jokes.

However, if I look at the big picture, it doesn't really seem she wants to pursue this any further. Whether it be casual dating or something more. I liked her and we had a blast on our date, so it's really a hard pill to swallow and I'm having a hard time dealing with it and understanding why.

Any advice? I don't feel like I'm being pushy, but maybe I am? Should I stop contacting her for like 3-4 days or just flat out ask her if she wants to meet again or not?",OsmiMagnet,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kcpvs/am_i_being_rejected/,1691390528.0,1.0
"To men on dating apps: why do u never respond? I (25F) have started dating again and the apps r terrible. Im considered moderately attractive, I have a decent job and I actually took time to make a nice profile. 
When guys swipe right on me, I try to ask them something based on their profile or just ask a random question. But for some reason, they just don’t respond. Maybe out of 20 matches, 1 guy will respond. Then after 2 weeks they’ll unmatch or I’ll just end up un matching them after a month. 

I don’t go for the top 10%. I swipe on guys looking for long term relationships(what I’m looking for), have a job, r from my culture and look average. 

Men on these apps, do u want to chase the girl? Does me messaging first seem like a turn off? I honestly dunno what to do. I’ve showed my profile to a variety of friends and they said it looks great. 

I even initiate phone calls and meetups. Idk guys never initiate anything :( . But then when they meet me they go head over heels. So I really dunno what to do. 

One of my male friends said I’m a bit awkward in my pics but I look cute. I don’t want to compete with the top 10% girls on the apps. Im fine with being average. But even average men won’t respond 🥲.

I feel so burnt out. I spend a week making conversation with a guy and things seem great and then they just leave me on read. It’s frustrating.

"Stood up by a girl who said we were supposedly soulmates? Recently stood up by a girl who I had been speaking to for a good few weeks. All was going well, when then became a lot closer with her saying how much I meant to her, and she wanted us to be together and all this stuff. I of course 
reciprocated the same thing as I too agreed.

She cancelled one date and then we reorganised it and her communication became very slow and dry compared to what it was on the lead up. I asked her what the problem was etc. She said she was a bit upset we didn't speak as much as we did before but she still had heavy feelings for me and sent me love hearts and all kinds.

The problem wasn't my communication though it was very much her's as previously mentioned. Anyway, the day before the date she was very excited she said, she was telling me how much I mean to her, sending me heart emoji's etc.

Day of the date...she doesn't turn up? I message her asking when she's coming, if she's alright and then I just gave up. Later that night I did message to ask her what the hell had happened? I wouldn't normally do this but felt I deserved an explanation especially if I meant so much to her etc. Anyway, a day on and still no reply?

Any advice would be much appreciated guys. Usually it would suck and be as easy as walking away and just never messaging her again but when she was saying how much I meant to her an stuff and as did, I reckon I deserve the truth.

"Recently single and so confused by all things dating right now. I’m feeling super mixed up. I’m definitely a relationship girly. I recently broke up with a boy that I loved a lot, but the relationship wasn’t reciprocal, and I needed different things than he was willing/able to give. I’ve been so immersed in hookup/dating culture, especially since moving to a new city. But I’m missing having someone that’s just my person. I recently had my first o from head, which was a lot. Somehow, I feel like it opened something in me that wanted more emotionally. I connected hard with the guy who did it, but he’s in an open relationship, and I need to detach myself before I get any more heartbroken. Now I’m wishing that I could feel that level of intensity in my (several) other interactions. I had a bit of a buzz going with a guy friend, but I really don’t want to fuck up a friendship by making a bad judgment call and exploring things, so there’s no way in hell that I’ll say/do anything on this front. I also am not in the mood to embarrass myself by chasing someone when I have plenty of guys that are tripping over themselves to talk to me. Simultaneously, I hate the idea of casual hookups now with guys that don’t have substance. This is the first time in my life where I’m not in a casual dating/hookup mood, and also not in a relationship.

I honestly thought i sent something wrong and offensive to her but after me and my friends re-read what i sent, we didnt find anyt bad abt my messages. So we are just confused and wnna ask for some advice. 

Plus we are both still following each other on ig, is that a shimmer of hope that she doesn't hate me? and I still hv a chance of getting a reply back? Maybe this ghosting is due to some personal issue and not in regards to what i did.

All in all i do feel that ghosting is a very immature way to end things. Given that we are both adults. As of now i have not reached out and decided to give her some space along with having some self-respect for myself.

"Is he trying to get rid of me 25F here, I’m from Bucharest, Romania. I’ve been using Tinder for a very short period of time at end of last year-beginning of 2023 and at the end of March I match this guy from Netherlands. He been here for a weekend and we matched after we was back in the NL. 
We started to talk on whats app. And talk and talk and talk and looks like we like each other so far but we both had to managed other things so we couldn’t meet so quickly (he had 2 weeks holiday already book, I had a nose job in May and needed to recover) so we meet mid July, he came to Bucharest, ee had a really nice date, we’ve been talking a lot and spend the weekend together. After he left, the next days told he’s “good except that I’m not there” and also nice things.
Before coming to Bucharest he had some health problems, doc told him it’s about some appendix inflamation. He took antibiotics, then when he came back to NL went for more investigation and a few days after he had a surgery urgently for appendix. Then he told me he’s still in hospital because he got some infection and need antibiotics again. He’s not answering the phone, he has it on DND, i texted him on whats app and just ignored me from monday to sunday and on sunday I texted him again if he blocked me or something and I’m very worried. He answered to me and told he’s still in hospital and can’t talk. He has a bad diagnosis and he doesn’t want to talk about, but told will need treatment for a while and he doesn’t lnow if will be better soon. Sugessted me to live my life as I don’t deserve this and it’s no sense to talk since he’s sick and don’t know if will get better. He didn’t even told me what he has. 
I thought maybe he wants to get rid of me but my gut instinct is tempted to trust him. He was nice to me and we had a good time. Even before his surgery he told me he’s not ok last days, but also didn’t give me sings that he doesn’t t like or something, he told nice things after we meet and that’s Why i m so confused now. I asked him in wish hospital he is because I wanted to go to him but he told me he doesn’t want to see me like this and also his parents are there and it’s awkward.

We couldn't really talk for a few weeks until one day she came and told me how overwhelming everything is, she feels emotionally numb, and the commitment of a marriage scares her now (fear of marriage was a case for her even earlier when we met 3 years ago, but it gradually improved, now its back). Having told about mental exhaustion and all, I reassured her, told her she os under no burden from my side and I would be there with her no matter what happens. She calmed down and we carried on. 

Now, the conversations have been dry, at times getting better, but dry for the most part. She still messages me first, sends me instagram reels if I am not awake and talking, talks to me daily even though she has a busy routine. Like she would be offline from social media all day but as soon as she is on, we would be chatting. Kept telling me about her emtional numbness, how positive messages dont make her feel anything anymore and she feels like she is just reading them. There were no heart emojis, response to ""I love you to"" would be ""ilyt"". 

Last night we were chatting, I told her we can go to therapy, and she was like ""Im fine."" (Notice the period). I did tell her that I love her and I can tell what she is going through despite her not telliing me. This ""Im fine"" ""I dont need help"" has been going on for a few weeks now. She seemed to have got offended, but ironically soon after this conversation she didnt want the chat to end and wanted to talk more to me. Last night was the first time in weeks she also sent me hee pictures, the chst ended woth her adding a heart to her last message.

"overthinking a LDR ex dated a guy mostly long distance as i moved countries for around 10months.
It started really good (end of july 2022). Same interests, instant click, I even think that if u remove the romance out of it we would’ve made great friends. Around march 2023, he started pulling away because of some problems he had IRL but he wouldn’t share (classic avoidant ?). He would constantly reassure me before 
but on that period Feb/March, things became different, he lied to me about being out to the movies with his friend and sister (where my friend saw them) and i can’t wrap my head about why he would hide that? 
Anyways, he became crappy at communicating, would like our mutuals posts and ignore my texts.
around april/may, I booked a flight home just to have an IRL talk with him (in which he was about to cancel lol - I feel stupid doing this when he could have called and I wouldn’t waste money, time nor energy.)
After that we agreed we’ll try to patch things up for the next months as long as he does effort. (Yeah i was asking for a phone call and a text, he couldn’t do that lol) by start of July I was done and broke up with him. He didn’t even bother reading all my texts just one where he felt like I hurt him with my words, but clearly him hurting me with his absence isn’t relevant. 2 weeks later, he texted to check up how m doing. And we send memes to each other rn (more than when we were doing when we were together).
Now I have no intention of trying to get back with him at all. I just find it funny how once the “relationship anxiety” is out he actually slightly talking like a decent person, it kind of reminds me of the whole Freud concept that a man cannot love and respect a woman at the same time.

Lately, i have been all these reels in my feed from accounts about lovers and all dirty stuff,  and i had never checked his followers before, now i find he follows almost all half naked girls, pxrn pages and he even claimed before that he doesn’t wanna be with a gf rn because he is getting more religious????

She did tell me that she was looking for something serious because she wanted to meet the right person to have kids with soon.

Would you look at your past partners to gauge one’s own attractiveness? Because all of my past partners were attractive to my standards, and most of them had to make the first move because I was too shy, my past friends would even remark that I could do better on some of my exes. I’ve also had girls who were not my type go crazy over me, but I never pulled a 10/10 girl.

I am curious to know if a perfect smile is something that is a deal breaker for you or not. 

My teeth are not perfect, I'm in the process of getting them fixed but it takes a lot of money and time. I grew up very poor with an alcoholic mother so she never took us to the dentist or doctor. I have baby teeth still, crooked teeth and they aren't pearly white.

"Need some unbiased input on a situation Context: I am a single father and have not seriously dated in over a year (since splitting with my ex fiance/child's mother).

I have been going to a restaurant near my work for lunch just about every day for the past month or two. There is a server there that I am attracted to and have a crush on. I know it is a hard to read situation and that a lot of guys can read too much into the actions of a tipped worker. I have taken the following steps to not be a creep or be obvious that I have a crush on her:
I have not spoken to any of her coworkers about her. 
I don't over tip. I tip the same $4-$5 to whichever server is serving me regardless of what I order. Mainly out of principal because I hate tipping culture and tipped workers deserve to be paid more. 
I know that regulars normally get treated more friendly than others, and I have taken that into consideration and try not to read into her actions too much.
I speak to whichever server I have about as much as the next. 
I engage a little more with my crush, but not in an overly flirty manner. Like one time, she mentioned that she couldn't wait to get off so she could go swimming, and then the next day, I asked her if she enjoyed her swim. She wasn't put off by it and confirmed that she did have a good time.
I sit in the same area of the restaurant every time I am there, just so happens that 8/10 times it is her section.
I have not asked her about anything too personal.
I have not confirmed if she is single yet. But, after talking with her a bit, she has yet to mention a significant other.

So, here are the situations that I am trying not to read too much into, but I need more input on.

1. She and a fellow server were talking at the register, and crush was facing away, other server said to her ""here he comes"" in a kind of playful tone. (This server is married and has 2l3 kids, they come in sometimes, just fyi)
2. Crush always makes a point to smile and says hi to me, even when she is busy.
3. We have a thing where she is trying to remember my regular order and always misses something. So I make light of it and just let her know what it is. I think this is more of a regular customer thing, though. 
4. I changed up my regular order recently and got less food than normal. She commented on it to me, and then she told one of her coworkers that I was ordering less food.
5. Last time I was there when she was working, she brought up that she had worked a double the night before and that she was exhausted from it. I jokingly asked, ""Why would you do that?"" And she explained that she was trying to get extra money so she could go to the beach with her family. We chatted a bit about this, she was leaving the next day and would be gone until this coming week, then told me some more personal info about her family. When I was paying, she said bye and did a sad little puppy eyes and pouty lip because she wouldn't see me all week.....

So. Give me your opinions on the situation?
Should I ask for her number or give her mine? 
Is she just being a friendly server? Is she flirting with me to get a good tip? Should I never go back because I have embarrassed myself and not even realized?",shrike26,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k8zez/need_some_unbiased_input_on_a_situation/,1691378526.0,1.0

"Open and honest or lie/evasive? So I'm 38M and haven't dated since I was like 19. I was a terrible alcoholic and had pretty bad social anxiety. Even my earlier dating experience is pretty nonexistent. The last girl I dated was a cousin of a girl I worked with. My only real girlfriend in high-school only lasted for about 4 months and we never really went out bc she was 15. I kinda dated this one other girl, but I didn't have a car so likewise worthless experience. The rest of my life I was so miserable that I didn't even seriously consider trying to have a relationship. So my primary question is whether I should divulge any of this information on a first date? I know that I'll eventually have to tell someone I'm dating, but how and when. I've finally gotten a date with a girl doing OLD. I basically have almost 15 years of my life that I'm ashamed of. I haven't drank in over three years and I have a successful handyman business now, so I have that going for me, but otherwise I'm terrified of what I'm going to say to various questions that will inevitably arise. So I either lie like crazy about my life, be evasive or be absolutely honest. I'm normally a very open and honest person so lying doesn't come naturally to me, but I don't want to scare this girl off. I have a couple of other girls I'm talking to online as well. Another question is whether or not to say a thing about other girls I'm talking to while doing OLD. I figure it's probably best to just pretend like they don't exist unless a girl specifically asks about my OLD experience.",RavenousFox1985,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k61iu/open_and_honest_or_lieevasive/,1691369982.0,1.0
"I (27F) found my boyfriend (32M) flirting with a girl he swore he hated and found annoying. What should I do? Me(27F) and my boyfriend(32M) have been together for 3 years now and I thought everything was going great. But a month ago I had this weird feeling that something wasn't right and I had to find out if he was still trying to talk to girls or pay for their OF. So 6 months into our relationship I found that he was paying girls OF and it really hurt me because he was also commenting on how nice one of the girls breast were. I was hurt mainly because I've always tried so hard in our relationship I have bought him expensive gifts since the first day we started dating and until the beginning of this year(2023) well back to last month I saw he was flirting with this woman(30F) it wasn't a light flirting. She would post pictures and he would say she's beautiful etc she replied back flirting with him as well. It hurts because he never comments I look beautiful. Also on their conversation he told her he would fuck her if he was single, he told her he would go hang out with her if he could, I also saw one time he told her he can go pick her up to take her to the doctor mind you she has 2 girls AND a boyfriend(not sure if he did). It hurts me because I've invested so much love into and I've never cheated on him also I've possibly wasted close to 20k on presents in the past 2 years and half and pay 2 of his bills. I've been thinking about leaving but if I'm being honest I've never tried this hard to stay in a relationship I always leave in the first red flag but my mom told me to actually try this time maybe I'm just over reacting so this is my longest relationship. His truck is under my name and now I wasn't able to get a car because of the truck so my car is under his name and I just feel like I've invested so much and I've never done this with anyone before so in my head I'm thinking maybe it will work maybe I'm just over reacting. I have confronted him but all he says is he was bored and it didn't mean anything but I'm not so sure this thing between them has been going on since BEFORE we started dating. Also after that conversation he was mad at me for 2 days and after he went about his days like nothing happened. Days later he noticed i was ignoring him and he text me saying ""i don't deserve you..."" and cried. Now I'm thinking if staying is a good idea or not or what should I do because we have stuff together. Also I live with him at his moms house I demanded a house I have a son and I feel like we need the space. He states we can't afford it atm, I told him I would get a 2nd job if necessary and he can do his side job but I'm not sure if he's lazy or I'm actually thinking that maybe he doesn't love me since he doesn't want to put much effort so we can afford our own place.",scareeedddd,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15kcyxg/i_27f_found_my_boyfriend_32m_flirting_with_a_girl/,1691391388.0,0.99
"What would be considered too much texting before meeting? I matched with this guy a few days ago who seems super nice and we had a solid text exchange last night. He asked me out on a date tonight and I said yes. I woke up this morning to 5 texts from him too, which I found a bit overwhelming since I haven’t met him yet and I was supposed to see him tonight. Around lunch time I had to reschedule (got thrown on an after hours work call at the last min) and he said no problem, and “if this had not been a first date scenario, he would come over with chocolate as it sounds like what I need right now”. I responded and said cool, lock in Monday! and can see he has sent 6 messages since.

I’m not sure if this guy is just nice/eager, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by it. Feels a bit odd for him to be texting me so much when we haven’t even met yet and we don’t even know if there is any real chemistry.

"Advice how to go about this? Should I reach out, or should I wait? Background: Me (F 28) single for a 1.5 years after a breakup of 3 year relationship, Person I'm dating (M 30) single for 1 year after a breakup of a 10 yr relationship  
I've been seeing a guy for 2 months now. From the beginning, we've had great communication and consistently saw each other every week. As I got to know him in a deeper level, for things that troubles him, I noticed he would rather have support/someone listen than get an opinion. Last week, he's been having trouble dealing with changes and I offered my support by comforting him. I didn't press on him to share but I did say I'm there in case he needed to vent/someone to listen to.  
I noticed his behavior shifted a few days ago. I asked him how he was, he said he was trying to get high, so I told him I'll leave him be to relax. The next day after he reached out first, and I asked him how he was feeling, he said he was busy so I told him to take it easy. He reached out yesterday saying he's been overwhelmed. I told him that I was sorry he was overwhelmed and that I was there to listen in case he was ready to talk/share, and that I was proud of him for making it through the day. He said thanks but said that he was busy for the whole day so wouldn't be able to text, but still confirmed to still see me next day and go ahead with our destination plan.  
The next day comes and he sends a text to push it to a later time. It was fine for me because I know he usually wakes up later so didn't want him to be too tired, so I agreed. 15 minutes later, he sends a text for a raincheck on our plan because he wasn't feeling well. I didn't notice this because I was getting ready so I only saw it an hour after, so I messaged to say that was fine and hope he felt better but wanted to confirm if he still wanted to see me (because there are times when we cancel our original plan but still saw each other). I never got a response back when he usually does even if it's to say ""no.""

"Unpopular Opinion but truth in it. Men and Women should not be trying to be friends...😱 hear me out. When I look for a friend I'm looking for motivation and inspiration to challenge and mold myself into a better man. Naturally other men would be best to help me with that, just as women would be more naturally better at doing that for other women. Now my big issue is majority of women profiles (on DATING Apps mind you.) state friendship only, or looking for friends first. And even some that list casual not knowing what that means(but that could be a whole other topic). But I'm assuming everyone else like me is human and enjoys having a romantic partner in their lives. Times have changed dating rapidly and with so many different perspectives out there now communicating is key now. When I invest time in a woman it's because I'm interested in her as a potential romantic partner. So if women and men can't be friends what good are they to each other?...DATES! Or what used to be courting to find a Tender and Caring emotional support partner which includes emotional bonds through physical intamcy 😱""disgusting man mentioned sex"" quit lying. it's natural drive of being human. So I will only invest my time in getting to know a woman if I'm attracted and feel she could be that romantic partner. Vice versa if a woman matches with me or is trying to get to know me I assume they are attracted and looking for a potential romantic partner. AND no I don't believe in Virtual dating. If a man and woman match each other then they should put on adult shoes and come up with a public date asap.

"[30 F] [35M] is he just not attracted or interested in me? 

 I’m constantly rejected and can anticipate that the guys who are showing me attention online will eventually lose interest (if you can call it that) and lead me on/reject me. 

This is my question. I was talking to a guy who I was attracted to (he was attractive.. he could literally get any girl) . 

He asked me out and we did go out because I guess we have a lot in common…. 

Long story short he left unexpectedly to move closer to his family. We kind of talked in and off but that stopped. We ended up discussing casual after he left and we tried to meet up once but he admitted he was trying to get over a break up and we stopped talking. I kind of got upset and said something about it to him and later apologized 

I reached out regarding being friends said that he saw it as unrealistic. I’m assuming he doesn’t like me any capacity or attracted to me at all? 

To end this story, I noticed he’s been liking my social media stuff? Why is he doing that if we’ve had no contact? After I apologized to him after we’ve had no communication with each other. 

And how come he hasn’t deleted me? 

Anyways, is he just not attracted or interested in me? Or is it just that he’s there and I’m here and he already said he doesn’t want distance, doesn’t see friends as realistic due to distance and isn’t feeling casual?

I told them that I’m trying to work on healing myself so that I can be able to do thing like flirt with my person but like on the first date I just want to chill, talk, get to know each other as friends. My friend kinda gave me the side eye and told me that that’s not how most people on dating apps or dating in general are going to be. So now I’m confused is my view weird or not normal, I thought just trying to get to know each other as friends first was a normal thing?

"Should I reach out to him and try? Or should I just let it go? Hi all. I’ve been seeing this guy constantly since mid or end February (sorry can’t remember lol) and it  just seemed to be going really well We live an hour away and both enjoy our busy lives, so we were consistently seeing each other once a week, twice sometimes…we connected well, did lots of fun things, the sex was great; and for a while he was really into me, talking about how much he loves kissing me and how we had such good chemistry. One of our last hangouts felt really good, like it just felt super right. We were even talking about future plans and stuff. 

Then probably these past 5 weeks or so he’s made like no effort. I have to ask to do something every time. Last week we were supposed to hang on a Saturday but no solid plans. Saturday afternoon he texts saying he doesn’t feel well and maybe we could hang Sunday. No follow up.
This week he said he might be able to hang but he doesn’t know because he might be going up north. But no follow up, and I’ve stopped following up because I don’t want to be annoying or really rejected anymore.  

Now it’s Sunday and I haven’t heard anything really. We send each other silly videos on Instagram, but he hasn’t sent me one since Wednesday, just laughed at the ones I sent. Which I know isn’t like a big deal, I don’t put much steak into Instagram videos but just adding it all up lol. 

Anyways I feel like he’s just phasing me out. It really really hurts. I just wish he’d be up front if he is, and tell me he’s not interested.

Should I reach out and try to get together with him? Should I ask him what’s going on? Should I just leave it and let it go?

"What`s the shortest gap anyone of you women slept with someone else before committing to a partner? I\`ve been dating this girl for 4 months now. It\`s been very good but yesterday I found out she has been sexting and sleeping with some men. These 2 last mouths I don\`t know, but I will assume probably. She has the right to do that as do i. But it still kinda sucks. I like this girl and she likes me. We want a serious relationship btw. This question is mostly for women. 

My question is whats the time gap anyone of you slept with someone to the time you have been official? 

For example, there was this girl that dated my friend and she found out he had sex with this girl 2 weeks before they became official. He told me it really bothered her. My question is what\`s the shortest gap anyone of you women slept with someone else before committing to a partner? 

For me 2 mouths would be reasonable if the girl i\`m dating did that hypothetically . If I found out she slept with someone some weeks before we became official that would bother me if it ever happened. I personally can\`t connect with someone on a deeper level and be fucking other women as well.

"I (26F) want to end things with my perfect bf (25M) I’m in a 2.5 month relationship with this kind, supportive, generous, loving guy… and I want to end it.

He is everything I wanted my ex to be like. He values quality time, considerate of my feelings, initiates fun dates, and more. So I feel like the biggest asshole ever not wanting to be in this relationship. 

I was with my toxic ex for almost 3 years. I ended things with my ex only a month before my new relationship. (Which my current bf new before dating me.) I thought I was ready and healed to begin dating again as I had no more feelings for my ex. However, I guess I never got the chance to be by myself and learn to practice self love before this new relationship started. I truly didn’t think i needed that single time up until this point, or else I would have never agreed to go exclusive. I never ever want to be the person causing another to feel pain or heartbreak. Hence posting on this subreddit to gain insight and advice. 

Issue is: I can’t tell if I’m having thoughts about running away from this relationship because of personal problems (e.g, not healed from my past relationship trauma/ the love I have for myself) or if I’m genuinely not into my bf as a person.

I was really excited to for this new stage of my life. Especially with my bf who is finally showing me what healthy love looks like. 

Apart from all the lovely things about my bf, there are a few things I can’t seem to get over:
- His energy. Every time we’re together, it feels like I’m the one that needs to entertain him. Like I’m the one that needs to intiate fun/ interesting/ loving/ whatever type of conversations or else he’ll just be sitting there blinking at me. Recently whenever he leaves, I feel drained and weird. I feel better after hanging out with my friends. 
- People have told me I’m a funny person. I know not all ppl will think I’m some stand up comedian, but all I know is that I’m a super goofy person that loves making ppl smile and laugh. And my current bf doenst really laugh with me. I totally get it if my humor isn’t his type thing but it bums me out that we can’t be silly or weird together. Which adds to the point above about mismatching energies. Also the stuff that he finds funny really cringes me out… like fat people jokes or one time he told me a “funny story” where his friend yelled some politically incorrect shit in the movie threatre… where I replied “that’s kinda mean” and he’s laughing saying “well I didn’t do it!”
- His energy in public. I think he’s a shy or socially anxious guy which I can empathize with… but when we’re out for a nice walk or a dinner date, he looks all around when i try to start up a chat or laugh out loud (almost like he’s embarrassed or anxious that I’m having fun? Which of course makes it not fun anymore) when I ask what I can do to help him feel more at ease, he says those questions make him feel worse… ok? 
- When I met his friends for the first time, they kept making jokes about how awkward my bf is. I began to see what they were saying when he mentioned weird things in our group convo.. it was so off putting and tbh a turn off. For example: the girlfriends I met of his are bff’s. So I was feeling nervous before the meet up. Before we met up with them, my bf told me that these girls are inseparable, so I jokingly said to him “oh god you’re making it worse” (jokingly! as I was anxious about them liking me) anyways he proceeds to tell them I said that within 5 mins of meetin them for the first time… !?  
- I never understood the saying  “confidence is attractive” but now I get it. He got a haircut and I wanted to see his new hair. I was complimenting him but he’s anxious about the size of his forehead. (he wears hats 24/7 which is obviously fine but I was trying to compliment him) So I asked to see his new hair, he took off his hat, and then proceeded to cover his forehead with his hand the whole time… and when I said it looks amazing, he replied “noo stop”… I was reassuring him and trying to be loving, but his self esteem issues are getting hard to navigate.
- Last thing: I feel like he’s moving our relationship way tooooo quick. We’ve together for less than 3 months and he’s already talking about our future, living together, and inviting me on family vacations. He also said I love you 3-4 weeks of knowing eachother.

I really like/liked him. But now the attraction is fading as I’m recognizing these new qualities of his. He loves me so much and does everything I wish my ex would have done for me. 

I will obviously chat with him about my feelings (not sure how? But I will) I’m not interested in leading someone on or ever ever hurting another, as I know too well how that feels like.

I’m here to ask: how do I know if my feelings are valid for wanting to end this relationship? Would the qualities I listed above change the way you veiw your SO? I’m so used to being manipulated and feeling unwanted… and now I have someone that’s truly into me… I don’t understand why I’m second guessing my emotions or feelings for him in this relationship.

hey, i'm (20M) currently facing a complex situation with a girl and i'm feeling unsure about how to handle it. it might be a lengthy post but i would really appreciate your help and advice ;(

a few months ago, a girl sent me a request on instagram. curious to know who was it, i accepted the req and texted them. i got to know that it was a girl on the other side. we were getting to know eachother and we instantly clicked, sharing many interests and i really enjoy talking to her. she said she was 17 and in 11th grade, so we haven't started dating due to her age but we got so attached to eachother and grew really close. it was evident that we wanted to date after a certain time so we continued our longdistance situationship. however, she took our thing very seriously and putting in a lot of effort for which i reciprocated. she has all the qualities I've been seeking for in a partner and we have a strong emotional connection.

after four weeks into the situationship, she revealed that she lied about her age and she's actually 15yo (9th grade). i felt incredibly guilty and my heart sunk. throughout those 4 weeks, there was no way for me to have guessed she was 15 based on her way of speaking/texting and appearance, unless she had informed me. i asked her why she didn't tell me earlier and she said she was afraid I wouldn't be interested in her and she liked me instantly when she came across my profile. initially, i wanted to end things because of the significant age difference between us. we didn't talk for three days but after a lot of thinking, crying for hours and discussing the situation with my close mates. i decided to remain as friends with her and stay in touch as a well wisher because I was too attached to completely cut ties + i didn't wanted to hurt her and given that im in college and low on finances, we aren't going to meet anytime. so we decided to continue it without crossing the limits. 

we kept talking for another four months. whenever we had disagreements, she was always willing to communicate and resolve the issues asap. she seemed too mature for her age (compared to my ex who's older than me). during tough times, she was always there for me, supporting and comforting me when i needed it the most.

fast forward to present: today morning, she dropped a bomb and revealed that she's in 8th grade, she had to repeat a class due to past depression of her previous rs. now i feel like my world is falling apart and my heart's racing faster. i feel guilty and shouldn't have took it this far. we're at different stages in our lives and im unsure of what to do. i don't want to hurt her by abruptly stopping our communication and cutting ties but at the same time, it feels too uncomfortable to continue it with someone who is still in 8th grade while im in college. we are at a point from which we can't go back. as im  writing this, my tears are streaming down my face. we were inseparable for these past few months, just thinking about that cutting off ties with her making me bawl my eyes out. i'm feeling so conflicted, pls help me. 

TLDR(gpt): A 20-year-old guy shares his emotional turmoil over a complex situationship with a girl he met on Instagram. Initially believing she was 17, they grew close and developed a strong connection. After four weeks, she revealed she was actually 15, causing him guilt and hesitation. Despite the significant age difference, they decided to remain friends. Months later, she disclosed that she's in 8th grade, leaving him conflicted and unsure of how to handle the situation without hurting her.

"Guy I'm seeing made joke comparing me to an ex gf We're in our 20s and I've been seeing this guy for a little less than a year. We've been busy so we haven't seen each other in the past two weeks. I was missing him so I mentioned a few times that I wanted a hug and missed cuddling. He made a stupid joke about how all this texting about wanting to cuddle reminded him of an ex and now he's wondering if all women were like that. I told him that it made me uncomfortable and he apologized. 

I fully believe that he'll be more aware of saying anything like that to me again and I know that it was just an offhand joke. We talked it out and moved past it. But I am still feeling a bit upset a few hours later. When I read his initial message it was really just a mood drop that I can't shake. We talked it out already so what else can I do to just move past this? How do I prevent myself from reacting like this again in the future? Sick of feeling sad over something so trivial lol

"Ghosted heartbroken friend advice needed! Story time - 

40 (f) 39 (m)

A friend of mine had been dating this guy for about 6-7months. I was surprised that she even dated this guy because she had only been romantically involved exclusively with women for many years. So, anyway she takes a chance with this guy and falls for him. She said he made her blush and at times she didn’t even know how to speak properly around him because she was so attracted. She knew she definitely had a thing for him and enjoyed spending time with him. They texted and communicated daily, saw each other about 3-4 times a week. This went on for about 4 months. Then suddenly he started distancing himself. She asks him about it a few times and each time he states he really likes her, he’s just busy working, and isn’t looking for a relationship. Which was kind of shocking for her because he pursued her as if that’s what he wanted initially. This totally felt like an excuse. But, she decided to continue the connection in hopes work would slow down or he’d change his communication frequency and perhaps his mind regarding a relationship. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and she says she ended up losing her patience. She told him basically all he seems to want is a doormat of a woman, that’s pleasures him, while he focuses on himself and offers zero commitment. She said this in a not so nice way. 

Now, he hasn’t even responded to her. She is feeling very sad, hurt, and unsure how to move on. She feels he should have at the very least understood as to why she was frustrated. I try to tell her to just let it go, he’s clearly just not that into you. But, she keeps saying deep down she feels something else happened that he isn’t being honest about. 

She has texted him twice since and has now stopped and will not text again. But, I can’t help but now feel so much disappointment in humanity in seeing her like this. I watched her fall for him, I watched her face light up talking about him. I fear she will never trust anyone again. 

What advice do you have for people that have been ghosted? Is this common? Even after 7 months and having introduced him to her entire family? 

Are people that cruel? Or, do you think he is just very hurt by her comments and will eventually come around?

"Is it fair to suffer just for being truthful? A lonely gay guy from Bangalore. I was in a lot of confusion when I was young so I didn't really made any friends.

When I came to work, I had some understanding about myself and the internet helped me understand it better.

When I discovered I'm gay and greysexual it was a big thing for me and I was excited. I really believed there are many guys like me out there.

But when I started looking online for hangout or cuddle buddies, the response was bad. All the conversations lasted only few minutes and it was either to understand my sexuality or convince me to try new things.

I slowly started loosing hope. I just keep on imagining if I'm in a bad environment or everyone online are bad. The problem is it's too difficult to understand if a guy is interested in hanging out in real world.

And being in a heteronormal society, even asking a guy outside in friendly manner seems weird for others.

"New BF Won’t Kiss Me My bf (24M) and I (24F) have been dating exclusively for several months. 

Some background: We both were living with our parents when we started seeing each other). I moved recently a few hours from home across state lines but we agreed to give long distance a shot, and so far it’s been great. I have been in several long-term relationships, this is his first relationship and he has not been involved with anyone - no kissing either. We both don’t want to have sex anytime soon (personal preferences), but at this point, I’d like to start getting a little more intimate. I mean he probably does too right?

I would just have gone for it by now if it wasn’t for the fact that this will be his first kiss. I’m afraid he wants to make the first move or isn’t ready yet or wants it to be special or something. I asked him out, but he’s planned and paid for all the dates, so he does take initiative. I can’t tell if I’m intimidating him or if he just wants to wait a little bit longer, or what. We’ve hugged, he seems to kind of side hug me tho… but again, can’t tell if it’s out of trying to be respectful or fear or what. I’m making eye contact, I’m complimenting him often. I’m flirting a lot and he flirts back too, I have given him every reason to feel confident. 

He’s coming to visit soon and we’ll have more chances to be alone. Should I just go for it and make a move when he visits? Should I talk to him about it first?

If so, you’re not alone.  
Defensiveness is a way of protecting ourselves from feeling guilty, ashamed, or threatened by someone else’s criticism or feedback.  
it can take many forms, including verbal attacks, denial, fabrication, avoidance, and gaslighting.

"Is this a good enough reason to not date someone? I (25F) recently have put myself back out there. I did 2 different speed dating events which I had no luck with, but it lead me to make a friend, Charlotte (28F). Charlotte and I haven’t been friends for very long, but she is probably one of the better friends I made since I moved to a new state a few months ago.

Last month, Charlotte told me she was going on a trip to her home state for few weeks. I didn’t text her as to not bother her while she was away.  Around this time I matched with Charlie (29M) on Bumble. Charlie let me know work was busy this time of year, (summer) but he would love to meet me in a month when things die down. That was July 10. Since then Charlie and I message, but not too often as I, too, am busy with work.

Fast forward 2 weeks and Charlotte was home from her trip. I had a weekend trip right after she got back, and then the next week I had to travel again to attend a family funeral.

Now it has almost been a month, and I am looking forward to setting up a date with Charlie. I had just gotten back from the celebration of life late Wednesday night. While I was thinking about Charlotte I texted her. I asked about this new guy she has been seeing, and she sends me a picture of the 2 of them saying they have made it official. I congratulate her and Charlotte asks me about my dating life. I give her a quick intro of Charlie and send his pictures to her.

Her immediate response was, “omg.”

I asked her, “what was wrong.”

She followed up with questions like how the conversations was between Charlie and I were. I immediately let out a sigh of relief and text her, “I was afraid you knew Charlie and he was an awful person or something.”

Charlotte responded with, “I love you. And I’m a firm believer in that some people may just not be right for each other. So yes I know him. Me and him were not right for each other.”

At this point I get on the phone and call her - this is where she tells me that they went on 1 or 2 dates. While it didn’t work out nor did it last long… but they did sleep together.

I have sat on this informational for a few days, and am aware it’s not that bad. Everyone has dating history, and I shouldn’t care because it was before me. Normally I wouldn’t but I know the person and she’s my friend so I just feel differently. I have asked friends &amp; family - everyone has a different answer. Should I continue talking to Charlie?

"[30 F] [35M] is he just not attracted or interested in me? 

 I’m constantly rejected and can anticipate that the guys who are showing me attention online will eventually lose interest (if you can call it that) and lead me on/reject me. 

This is my question. I was talking to a guy who I was attracted to (he was attractive.. he could literally get any girl) . 

He asked me out and we did go out because I guess we have a lot in common…. 

Long story short he left unexpectedly to move closer to his family. We kind of talked in and off but that stopped. We ended up discussing casual after he left and we tried to meet up once but he admitted he was trying to get over a break up and we stopped talking. I kind of got upset and said something about it to him and later apologized 

I reached out regarding being friends said that he saw it as unrealistic. I’m assuming he doesn’t like me any capacity or attracted to me at all? 

To end this story, I noticed he’s been liking my social media stuff? Why is he doing that if we’ve had no contact? After I apologized to him after we’ve had no communication with each other. 

And how come he hasn’t deleted me? 

Anyways, is he just not attracted or interested in me? Or is it just that he’s there and I’m here and he already said he doesn’t want distance, doesn’t see friends as realistic due to distance and isn’t feeling casual?

She seemed to get me - she said I seemed like a good person and picked up I've been taken advantage of by women in the past(sadly true) Eventually she invited me to a live music show at another bar in our town today, and I said that I'd go.

"How common is cheating these days when it comes to new relationships? TLDR -  I'm 17, starting to date, and wondering much of an issue cheating actually is since it gets exaggerated by social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway because people I know irl follow my main account.  


I'm asking this out of genuine curiosity. For context, I'm 17M and starting to seriously think about dating for the first time in my life. I feel confident in my looks/personality and a few girls in my friend group have expressed interest in dating/ getting into a relationship with me. They're all super nice and I love spending time with them, but the idea of getting cheated on scares me enough to just feign disinterest and keep them in the friendzone instead. I feel terrible doing this, though, and I want to know how irrational I'm being by letting this thought prevent me from dating.

&amp;#x200B;

For as to *why* I feel this way, it's mostly just social media getting to my head. Social media of any kind is the absolute worst for feeling secure about the future of a relationship. Thirst traps, incels, tate fans, celebrity breakups - it seems like everyone is trying to tell me that if my girl isn't being pampered 100% of the time, she's already hanging out with sombody else. I know how idiotic that sounds by itself, but I guess the constant exposure to all this crap has finally gotten to me. Thousands of stories of people cheating on their SO over insignificant stuff can't all be coincidences, y'know?  


I'm mostly just asking for y'alls thoughts on the matter. Is cheating common enough to worry about? How worried about it should I be going into this stage of my life? What are your experiences with cheating as a risk?

"Children of unhappy parents? I’m unhappy in my relationship for many reasons. We’ve been through a lot. We’ve been together 8 years, with an almost 6 year old. I want to be separate but I can’t stand the thought of not having my son every day.

"Girl Unmatches On Hinge Because I Took 5 Minutes to Reply I've (19M) had hinge for about a week, and it's been nothing so far, until tonight. I finally matched with someone, and had a brief convo with them. We talked about conventions basically (as one of my photos was me with a celebrity at a convention). She sent another message and I opened it, but before I could respond, something came up that took my attention away. I had to put my phone down for five minutes, and when I came back, I saw she unmatched me.  
  
Like...seriously? I was away from my phone for 5 minutes! I was so excited and nervous too because this was my first match, and it was going great. She was nice, pretty, and just seemed awesome, plus, she was very enthusiastic and showed interest in talking to me. Gah, I know this tends to happen with these apps but, I mean, it isn't like I left her on read for an hour, or several...jeez.  
  
I was going to post this on the hinge subreddit but for whatever reason it won't let me post. Perhaps I have too little karma, I don't know. (I'm also reposting this here because I feel like venting...sorry).",kendrick20004,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k9b72/girl_unmatches_on_hinge_because_i_took_5_minutes/,1691379571.0,1.0
"At some point do you just give up on trying to find the right person? For quite some time now I(30M) have tried and failed over and over again at finding the right person. By that I mean a woman I can actually marry. I have had a girlfriend for a year, but we broke up because we just weren’t looking eye to eye,(also get ready of reading this a lot) she told me that it’s not me, it’s her and that she needs to sort things out first. We broke up about 7 months ago and I have tried for the last 7 months to work on myself, working on finishing my Degree in computer engineering, tried dating other girls too, but on that one I just have no idea what am I doing wrong. 

I went out with a girl that has also had a failed marriage, I would’ve loved to start something with her but that damaged her so bad that she was just a depressed wreck. I tried helping her, also got the famous “it’s not you, it’s me” message, she also got mad at me for some reason. I was trying to help for her overcome depression and tried my best to be supportive but I guess I overstepped some boundaries.

I then met another girl, we hit it off pretty well, we had excellent chemistry, then she told me that she thought about us, to which I responded “I think I know where this is going”. Anyway, she told me that things between us just progressed so fast,  that she hasn’t fully recovered from her last relationship that lasted for 7 years and that she broke up with him about 8 months ago. I also heard from her that it’s not me, it’s her and that she needs to heal first. She also told me that she feels “too childish” compared to me. That’s also something I heard pretty frequently or something very similar, mainly that sometimes I am too serious, that I should ease off a little. I have no Idea what they mean or are talking about, I know how to crack a joke from time to time. I mean I am no expert for cracking jokes , but I also don’t think that I should put on a monkey suit and start act like I am on crack or something. Seriously, what did they mean, when they tell me to ease off a little?

Then I DM’d other girls too, but they were usually very short response chats, in other words more failed attempts. Also I should note that I usually meet girls via Instagram, because that’s the only way of contacting anyone these days apparently. I would love to try and approach a girl in real life but I just have no clue how to do that in today’s time without it going awry. 

I also forgot to mention one more girl, but that also ended with “I’m not sure, it’s not you, it’s me, bla bla”. 

I feel like an Idiot at this point and sorry for my very long rant, but I am just losing hope at finding the right girl. I am tired of rejection, while it doesn’t hurt as bad as when I first started, it has always had a huge toll on my self esteem and being 30 years old, I am not sure what to do. I am also sick of self help and all that crap, because at this point it’s all fairy tale nonsense and not actual real life. 

I admit I am not the richest guy in the world, nor do I really have that much money too, but I am also not broke. I have a job, I am finishing my degree in computer engineering, I am almost native-fluent in two foreign languages(english and german) and I know a little turkish on top of my own native language. I am also quite skilled in drawing and painting, especially drawing portraits. I also have a vast knowledge about video games, movies, and overall pop-culture. I am also quite religious(a muslim), not the most knowledgeable , but I consider myself a healthy amount religious and knowledgeable. Not sure if all that was important, but I felt like I needed to just throw it out there.

Is the right girl just going to materialise out of thin air or should I keep trying and failing until it finally works with somebody? I am not sure about anything at all anymore.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar and have you succeeded at one point?

"I think I’m catching feelings again but I think he’s just horny So last year I met a guy at the gym who came and tried helping me. I didn’t think much of it since he was just genuinely helping me with my form. 

It was all small talk like we just say hi and “how are you?” Little by little I started developing feelings. I decided to shoot my shot and asked for his number. He said he got into a car crash and was currently driving so I found the right timing to ask for his number and give him rides. 

From there, he was the one texting me like once a week to say hi and wish my a wonderful week …etc. he would throw subtle signs that he liked me so I shoot my shot and told him I liked him. He said he felt the same. 
The day when I saw him he carried me in the gym parking lot and kissed my cheek. Lol
I went to his house to hang out and initiated a French kiss. Yes I feel like I initiated everything. I sat on top of him and started making out. Lmao 2 weeks in we started having sex. We sorta dated from January through April. Then we kinda got into an argument and stopped talking for like a month. 

Since then he’s slowly texting me every week and just recently he’s been calling me twice a week. 

Keep in mind I haven’t seen him because I have been avoiding the gym. Lmao. I still like him and want to avoid getting attached. 

So last night we were face timing for 2 hours. He went grocery shopping and was asking me stuff like what should I make for dinner. He asked me if he should cut his hair. I threw in subtle signs that I find him attractive with shorter hair. I told him “remember when I confessed I liked you” he smiled and kinda got nervous. 

My dad injured his arm and he asked me if he can stop by house later to drop off the peppermint spray… I said yes. He came and for the first time in 2 months I had seen him again and my heart felt so good!!😭😭 he hugged me 3 times. The first hug he hugged me sooooo right for like a whole minute. He hugged me again then before he left he hugged me again

I’m not sure if I’m tripping. He called me again this morning to see if the spray worked for my dad. I really like him but I don’t want to ruin this friendship lol.

"Ghosted by coworker I started a new job several months ago. I was having a tough time connecting with my team at first, but we hired a couple new people and it’s made work way more enjoyable. 1 person in particular I seemed to really vibe with, my productivity went down slightly but it felt great finally connecting with someone and the shifts would go by way faster while getting to know each other. She would tell me pretty personal stuff about her recent breakup, family, and financial situation, so I started feeling comfortable talking about similar things but didn’t share too much about my issues.

After working a few shifts together I got the courage to ask for her number and she gave it to me without any hesitation. We started texting and getting closer at work to the point that there was a lot of unnecessary playful touching, nothing inappropriate but our hands would always linger longer than needed and sometimes she’d graze me or I would her. After this our texts at home would get increasingly intense. We’d talk about things we’d want to do together, lots of jokes, fun random facts about each other, with lots of word play and innuendos. And then the texts got more and more sexual, with no innuendos needed. Straight up talking about what we would do to each other and how much fun it would be. This went on for about a week, we would consistently text each other day and night, though we weren’t scheduled to work together for that week so the sexual tension between us kept growing. She messaged me while I was at work saying how I seemed like I’d know how to make her climax. And we tried to make plans for me to pick her up after work one day.

Then there was 2 days of no contact. I didn’t think too much of it. I get it, people get busy and we were spending a lot of time communicating through messages. It got to the day before our plans, and I still hadn’t heard back. And this could possibly be my screw up but I’m not sure, I unfortunately realized I had made plans about a month prior for that same night we were supposed to hang out. So I texted her after having not heard from her for 2 days and let her know I wouldn’t be able to make it. She eventually got back to me reassuring me everything was good and she just was away from her phone because she was spending too much time on it. She also said it was totally okay and she understands and not to worry. A few more texts were exchanged and she sent me a photo of her looking really cute at work. I replied soon after and haven’t heard back from her. I waited a few days before following up. This was during the weekend and we were scheduled together the upcoming week. She called out on the day we were supposed to work together. Another week went by and she did it again. Called out when we were scheduled together.
I’m just really confused, everything seemed to be going great at work and even better over text but the last thing I received was a cute pic and then it was radio silence.

Could she have gotten upset I couldn’t make it to our first date even though she said it was okay? Did she realize our texts were inappropriate and got embarrassed? Is she scared of seeing someone so soon after a bad breakup? Does she think I’m a creep? Was it just bad timing and she was talking to other guys at the same time and doesn’t have the heart to tell me?

I’ve been pretty depressed about it and I’m getting the feeling she might quit soon as she had previously mentioned job interviews she had with other companies. Obviously I know where and when she works but I know confronting her about it when I’m not scheduled would be pretty intrusive and unwelcome and seem desperate. I honestly just really want to know what happened even though we don’t know each other that well and she doesn’t owe me any kind of explanation, but I would really appreciate that as it would help put my mind at ease. We are scheduled to work together again next week and I’m just prepared for her to leave me hanging again and this feeling just really sucks.

"An old crush messages me once every 6 months to a year like clockwork and I’m not sure how to take it TLDR: old crush fades in and out knowingly and either has bad attachment issues or is actively fucking with my head with false hope

So I had a crush on this girl G all through high school. We were pretty decent friends but she didn’t see me that way. Our group pushed me to date another girl from G’s friends and we dated a few months at the end of senior year. I had my first kiss before college, even though it didn’t last long. I dated, had flings, had my first love blow up, dated a controlling abuser, and am now working on myself and staying single after a couple of almosts pushing 30.

From 18 to 26, years go by and I’d see G at college occasionally and we were friends. Then after undergrad she moved about an hour away and she started this trend of texting me or snap chatting or sending me memes on social media. I still definitely held onto hope but the pattern became obvious over time. She would reach out, I’d respond, and then she’d Grey rock, turn her notifications off, and eventually the convo would just stop. Then out of the blue months or years later she’d rinse and repeat.

I’d be between relationships or failed tinderships and we hooked up a couple times. I always got the sense she knew she could use me that way and I’d fall for it, and at different times I told myself I was okay with it. But as soon as I ever showed anything beyond cold detachment, up go her walls.

This has continued through the past 5 years, moving across the country, moving back, and I now I just see it as a trap. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt that she just wants to be friends, to catch up, and the little hope voice thinks maybe she finally is reciprocating, but the behavior pattern always feels like she’s keeping me around as a backup plan in case someone better doesn’t come along, or if she needs a Sunday Blues self esteem boost, she can shoot me a message and gauge if she still has me in her pocket. 

I think i fall prey to abusers and people who want a relationship only on their terms. Emotionally unavailable orbiters who purely seek validation, and know that if nothing else, your desperate consolation prize is there if they need a pick-me-up.

Just sucks because the reality of how this persons actions come across and how my fantasy of them feels does not align and I either have to play along, call them out and potentially look like an asshole while they have their plausible deniability, or just ghost and block, which feel harsh. I haven’t seen her in person in a few years but we have always made non commital plans to meet up for coffee but life. It just sucks because just by this post, you can tell how much power this person has that they can get me all in my head with a fucking text.

"My seventh one-night stand on herpes dating site— about my dating experience on a herpes dating site  Hello everybody,

Before I move any further, let’s have a brief introduction about my seventh companion in my little adventurous journey on this herpes dating site.

The lady in question, Jenny, was a nurse at a local clinic. A woman that redefined simplicity - petite with short, rough-cut black hair, hazelnut eyes and a skin that was more pale than tan. No-one could call her a head-turner but she held a modest attraction that was hard to ignore.

The date was as plain as dates could be - meeting over a cup of coffee. We met at a little café that smelt of freshly roasted beans and old books. In the most mundane manner, we exchanged pleasantries and spoke about our respective backgrounds. Taking sips from our coffees, we simply rambled about our occupations, the shared experience that brought us on this dating platform and some day-to-day life topics.

With the shadows growing longer, the café started to empty, and the chatter came to a gradual end. Rather unexpectedly, she felt comfortable enough to invite me over to her place. And I, being the protagonist of this story, agreed to go along.

At her place, we chit-chatted some more before she led the way into her bedroom. You can guess what happened next - we had sex. Nothing sophisticated, it just happened in plain old, simple style – two adults, with the same medical condition, deciding to spend that night in each other’s company.

And there you have it. The tale of my seventh one-night stand – nothing outlandish, nothing out of ordinary, just an everyday story of and from an everyday life.

Until next time, folks.

"Unserious Women on Dating Apps I’ve been on dating apps off and on for a few years now. Obviously, the experience hasn’t been too successful so far as I am still on them, but I digress… For some context, I live in a major city, am 29, male, active, in shape, 5’11” and have a good—if demanding—job. I got out of a fairly mediocre five month relationship from the apps and have been trying to put myself back out there as time allows while also working on self-improvement. Anyway, I had a girl reach out to me after matching. We got to talking and then I told her if she was looking for  the same thing as me (“a long-term relationship with someone who shares the same values as me”) that we should meet in-person. She agreed, and we moved to text. So far, so good. Over text and on the app, I told her I was going out of town for a week but would be happy to meet her when I got back. It took her over a day and a second text to get her to reply if that was okay, to which she said “sure,” and requested that I text her when I got back. Fast forward to today as I return from traveling and I did exactly that: texted her this morning to set up a time to meet. There has been no reply, and I expect no reply. Maybe she met someone else, but, as I said, even the first out-of-app text I sent her required a double text to get a meaningful reply.

I’m really not hung up on this single girl, but rather am frustrated by the trend of unserious women I’ve experienced on dating apps. You would think that after establishing a baseline understanding that both people are seeking the same thing—hence why I am forthright about my intentions in my texts on the apps, which girls have told me in-person is refreshing and shows confidence on the man’s part—there would be better, more intentional communication, but that hasn’t been the case for me at all.

The last relationship ended because, without going into too much detail, the woman was also unserious; she claimed explicitly to me she wanted to settle down with a career-oriented man with a professional job focused on the future, but in the end states she wanted someone more “boyish” and who “drove trucks” (her words, not mine—I have nothing against men who drive trucks at all, but it was news to me that’s what she was looking for). Likewise, there have been shorter experiences (one to two dates max) that have died because the communication between dates was like pulling teeth on my part. I typically ghosted these ones or got ghosted myself—waiting 24 to 48 hours (and in some cases longer) for one-sentence replies to texts in the days after dates the girl claimed to me were “great, I can’t wait to see you again” just got exhausting.

I’m obviously a bit frustrated and demoralized (and I’ll be upfront and state that I have things to work on myself and have been trying to learn from past relationships and situationships, hence why I am not giving up), but it seems like all the effort here in my time OLD has been one-sided and the common denominator has been unserious women who are not only not honest with what they’re looking for but are atrocious communicators. I’m sure others have similar experiences.

TL;DR Why are so many of the women I’ve met on dating apps unserious and / or terrible at communication?",nyc-203,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k0e2p/unserious_women_on_dating_apps/,1691355341.0,1.0
My boyfriend doesn’t initiate intimacy often. My (23F) boyfriend (31M) of several years doesn’t often initiate sex. This makes me feel unwanted and generally just doesn’t make me feel good. He is a great person and I’m genuinely happy in our relationship. I have communicated my feelings with him and he listens. His responses to how I’m feeling usually consist of “I’m in a slump” or “I don’t know what to do about this.” I don’t ever want him to have sex if he doesn’t want to but I also feel like how I’m feeling is important too and there has to be a middle ground somewhere. I feel like he isn’t opening up to me about how he is truly feeling and I don’t know how to solve this issue if I don’t know how he’s truly feeling. I guess I’m just looking for advice because I love him and I want our relationship to be as healthy as possible. I feel like intimacy is an aspect of a healthy relationship.

"dated a christian guy 
A background info / as any teenager would be, i started to be curious on the dating life and began to experiment. Ended up settling with a guy, let's name him B.   It's safe to say that B is religious, a christian dude who is very active in church and youth assemblies. Bible verses all over his social media typa guy. 

I myself isn't very religious, my granddad is an atheist, both my parents are roman catholics but we aren't too exposed to attending masses and hardly ever pray and we still respect those who are devoted followers. But I thought to myself that maybe dating a nice religious guy like B won't be so bad.

It all started when B invites me to go to church with him, but I refused and explained that i'm not comfortable with the atmosphere with a lot of people in 1 area, loud instruments, and dancing.
He hits me up w the ""its your decision, ofc im not forcing u"" and I thought it was the end of it until he gets rly pushy, in a calm way but i keep refusing and then he'd ask again the next day, and the next, and the next. The first straw was when B told me smth along the lines of ""the end is near... and i gotta accept God as my savior and then dropped the ""but im not forcing u"" line. 

Same thing with B forcing me to introduce him to my family and also him introducing me to his mom when it hasn't been even a month of us officially dating. This was also an everyday reminder from him and ofcourse, ending it with an ""it's still your choice, i'm not forcing you"" But it's not that i don't want to introduce him yet, my mom also had a very tight schedule and we hardly ever got to spent any free time with her. 

One time we we're talking abt music and I mentioned Queen,  and then B looked at me dead and said ""did you know that Freddie Mercury sold his soul to the devil, that's why he got famous that quick"" I tried to laugh but this boy was not fcking laughing and added that the rock and roll hand sign meant something devilish
And I just couldn't believe my ears that I'd actually hear this typa shit from an actual person being dead ass serious about it and it left me blankly staring at him because I didn't think there was a purpose arguing back. And yes he already knew that I was a huge fan of metal and rock music.

And over time, i just sorta got used to all B's touching. At first he was asking for my consent but each time i refuse but he always does it anyway, and i thought it was all normal for dating and i should just put up with it. One time we we're hanging out and B pointed out the sins I've done according to the bible so i built up my courage to say that isn't he the one committing a bigger sin between the both of us on a regular basis, Lust. And B's reasoning was that, that type of stuff is only natural and couldn't be helped.

These are the only the stuff i found weird about B that are related to religion.

I never argued with of these with B because I thought that I'd be disrespecting his beliefs.",rat_raspberry,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15k03d2/dated_a_christian_guy/,1691354626.0,1.0

"Just expressing an opinion on modern mentality Hey guys, I met a girl recently and we hit it off really quickly. We met 4 weeks ago and we've been seeing each other almost on a daily basis. When we are together people think that we've been together for years because of how comfortable we are with each other. 

Last night I expressed to her that I would like to make sure that we are exclusive and that I'm starting to get attached to her. So she said yeah we are exclusive but she thinks that my feelings aren't real because 4 weeks is too fast, like if emotions had a timeline attached to them. So it got me thinking, after one week she was sending me nudes, after 2 weeks we were having sex (and that, for her, was long), but having feelings after 4 weeks is too quick. 

So it got me thinking about when did the shift happen to sex, nudes, OF, serial dating and the such becoming normal behaviour and having real feelings have become taboo?

"What’s the point in lying to people when online dating? Honestly, just a rant about my recent experience with online dating. 

I (28F) had been out of the dating game for about 7 years, before 2023 started. About two months ago, I met a guy on Bumble and we really hit it off. Talked for almost two weeks before going on a date. First date was great, we had an engaging convo and I was excited like “wow, this is going really well!” 

Too bad it didn’t last. 

So I am someone who is very open about not wanting kids (either my own, or someone else’s). It’s a personal preference due to events in my childhood and early adult years. When this guy and I got past the superficial questions, I made a point to bring this up only a couple days into talking and prior to our first date (mainly just that I did not want to have kids). No point in wasting time if we’re not on the same page - my opinion is not going to change so we can move on to find other people better suited for us if we don’t align. His Bumble profile did not have any mention of kids, or preference, and he never said anything about them; kind of steered the convo away. I didn’t pick up on it at the time but I wish I had.

Fast forward a month, and three dates in. Get a text from the guy, saying he wants to talk about something important, and that he was surprised I hadn’t asked him about it on his profile. I was confused and immediately went to our old messages on the app. 

And there it was on his profile: “Have kids and don’t want more.” 

What. The. Fuck. I screen my swipes pretty carefully and don’t swipe on people who either have kids/ want kids because I know it will be a point of contention. So I knew it was not listed on his profile when we originally matched. After a lengthy text from him about the situation with the kid, I ended things. Truthfully it was only partially because of the kid, but more because he lied to me for a month about everything when he knew my feelings.  

I just don’t get the point of lying to people you’re starting to date, especially when it’s something so big. It’s one thing if the topic doesn’t come up, but cmon dude.

I want a connection first, but with everyone I met, they want to do sexual stuff right away.

"(24M) Advice for “escalating” friendly conversation with women I find attractive? I don’t know how to flirt or tease with attractive women I meet in the real world and so it just remains friendly conversation and never seems to flow into an opportunity to hook-up or ask for a date.

I’ll give an example. A few months ago I saw a (24F) coworker at a work event/holiday party thing. Basically had a handful of scattered conversations with her previously over Zoom or at other events previously, but talked a lot more this time. We seemed to really vibe tbh, talking about coworkers, shit-talking the company, asking her a lot of questions. At a 3 hour event we probably talked one-on-one for like an hour. She’s cute and very intelligent and career-driven which I all find attractive. But even with a couple drinks in me I never tried to flirt or tease or anything like that, and I couldn’t gauge if she also liked me like that. Like, is this just two coworkers bantering or is there mutual interest? I can never tell, and I think this is because I don’t know how to gauge interest in the moment like that. I guess I’m fearful of the awkwardness if she recoils when I show attraction. This is why I think I have better luck on dating apps even if I hate them, there’s an immediate assumption of sexual attraction when you match.

To put it another way, *conversations I have with women I find attractive are pretty much exactly the same as conversations with women I don’t find attractive and other men.* Is that good or bad? Is this what’s holding me backing in dating? HOW do I escalate conversation in these situations?",FudgeStriking1832,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jw0zs/24m_advice_for_escalating_friendly_conversation/,1691344787.0,1.0

"How do you stop being a sex addict? IDK if this is actually sex addiction, or just pursuing validation or whatever.

I'm a person who very much wants to settle down and have my own family. I'm late 20s and I live in one of the most populated cities in the world.

I was dating a girl for a few months and thought she was the one, but she basically told me she's not actually interested in a relationship. Almost immediately after I just went on dating apps and one side really wants to find someone to settle down, but the other side sees all these incredibly attractive women saying they're just looking for sex and I get so tempted I always end up going for them. I now have 3 FWB and I'm really worried that I'm not progressing anywhere with a real stable partner, and that these girls might eventually be hurt if I end things...

"Who else swipes left on people with ambiguous relationship goals?

Why are you even on the apps because it seems like you're there just to waste people's time. You had your whole life to think about this.

And then you ask them, and they say ""Only if I meet the right person.""..... isn't that the default goal of looking for a relationship, to meet the right person? Do you want to meet the right person or not? Who wants to search for a serious long term relationship... be with them for years and years, and then say to them ""I'll still be in this long term relationship with you, but I won't have kids or get married with you because you aren't the right person, but I won't break up with you.""

"I (M20) got my girlfriend (F20) pregnant 5 months ago, and we got an abortion. Is our relationship salvageable? 
I (M20) am dating a girl i've known since highschool (F20) as we ended up going to the same University. I'd been into her for a while, but just too scared to make a move. I eventually ran into her at the library, and we ended up talking for hours. The chemistry was there, and we clicked in a ton of ways. She told me about some of her personal issues, and I spilled about mine. Her friend was even there, but it felt like just us, and it ended in her inviting me to a movie. I flaked under the pretense that I had somewhere to go, but it was really because I just felt...undeserving. Despite always having an eye for her, I put a lot of distance between us. She's going down a similar path to me, but without as much financial support. She's always been extremely strong academically and has had a high drive for success. I just felt like I could ruin that, as relationships often can be a big distraction. Especially young love. 

After making a move the second semester, we started talking. We bonded quickly, and within about 4 weeks began dating. Our conversations were easy, rife with interaction, and we both come from different backgrounds and very different places, with very different families, but enjoy a lot of the same things. I struggle with my partner because I just feel like I don't deserve her. It's still a large struggle in our relationship, but i've gotten better at taking her off a pedestal. Being the first guy she ever dated because of a SA in her past and some serious distrust in men (due to this and other things), she was slow to have sex. As we became closer, she opened out to me a lot and became very comfortable with me very fast. This was mutual, and we were both very happy. 

She had a lot of fear regarding sex: pregnancy could ruin her future, it was something she had never done and wanted it to be serious, and she had trauma that made it scary and potentially uncomfortable. She also had some insecurities about my sexual experiences, many of which did not occur with protection. I never intended for her to know this as I knew she wanted to use protection and fully accepted that, however a mutual friend with a blabber mouth mentioned how sex was better without protection. She mentioned how both me and her agreed on this to my SO (a conversation she and I had before we were together). I've since put some distance between me and this person for a lot of reasons, this being one of them, and the other being that she makes my partner uncomfortable. This culminated in us having a conversation about sex, and we agreed that although we both wanted to do it, we weren't sure when, definitely wanted protection, and would give it time.

Well...a couple weeks later she said she wanted to have sex. I was unprepared: I thought it would take a lot longer for her to become comfortable with that, and although I was elated, I did have my doubts about her state of high arousal conflicting with her judgment. I asked multiple times if she was sure, and she said yes, so I went to look for a condom. This was the first girl I was going to have sex with in college, and although I had condoms, my roommate had been taking them because he was sexually active and I wasn't using them. I ended up having none left, and told her we couldn't have sex, which was a bummer. Well, 30 minutes later, with us still going at it (just without penetration), she said she wants to do it without protection. I myself had no qualms, but I knew this was something she didn't want to do before, and so I once again asked multiple times if she was sure, if she wanted to take the risk, etc. She told me yes, that we could use a plan B, etc. 

Despite taking a plan B the morning after, she ended up still getting pregnant. In our state you cannot get an abortion, and although it was extremely early, she still had to go to another state. Her brother and mother took her, and she had a Plan C pill, which worked well. I ended up seeing her family after this all occurred, but before she had told me and her father. We hit it off; I loved her family, they liked me (I believe?), and her father even called me his stepson in spanish on accident, which I'd imagine means he took quite a liking to me. Her having a boyfriend was a big deal; she had always turned guys down, and would go on dates but never further than that. The only interaction that was off was with her Mom (due to her knowing that I had gotten her daughter pregnant). When she did tell her father it created an immense amount of conflict within their family. Her religion is very strictly against abortion, and her family is very religious. This also took a toll on her, as although she is not as religious, she still subscribes to her religion. 

This happened about two months into us dating, and three months into us talking. It has affected us in a lot of ways: she will be colder to me out of nowhere. She struggles with seeing me when it conflicts with seeing her family. She has always wanted a boyfriend who could be very close to her family, and although I fit in well and was ready to take on that role, her father refuses to see me again until I marry her. Her mother also is very uncomfortable with us being together. Her brother and his girlfriend seem fine with me, and we have gone on double dates and hung out together, however whenever she discussed this with him and how it was difficult to maintain a relationship with me as I won't be a part of the family any time soon, he himself said he couldn't do that and would have to break up with somebody who their family couldn't accept. She is unwilling to end our relationship, despite the strain this has put on both of us. I am too. I love her a lot. I loved the chemistry we had, how I saw her smile on our first date, how she talked to her family and how everything feels so new even though I'd been in relationships and met families before. 

She's the first woman that isn't just an extension of my self-destructive nature, and one of the first girls i've ever loved as much as they loved me. Now it feels one sided a lot. I just don't know if we will ever be able to go back to normal, but seeing what we were and what we could be makes me so unwilling to give up. 

Edit: for timeline, we started dating in February. She got an abortion in April. we've been together for about 7 months now

"Should I ghost her? To understand the whole situation, let me give you a little back story. My last actual relationship was more than 3 years ago, and after it ended I went through a lot in my personal life which has made me a very anxious person. So recently I just started dating again, met an amazing girl who I really liked but then things were evolving too fast and I ended up trauma dumping on her which led to us walking our separate ways and left me devastated. However, I stayed on tinder and matched with a girl I thought were cute and we started talking. We decided to meet up this weekend for Pride and me and my friend was drinking the whole day during the parade so I was pretty drunk when we met. We had a fun night in the group setting but at some point I get very anxious (am previously diagnosed with social anxiety) and my first instinct is to get out of there so I take my stuff and leave. She texts me and asked where I was and I was being honest and said that I panicked and needed to be alone. She didn’t let me just walk away so she came and calmed me down and I ended up staying at her place, she was being very sweet. But this morning when I woke up next to her, I realised she did not really look like her pics, she is really not my type and it was kind of awkward to have to spend the 2-3 hours with her before we said goodbye. And me not being able to reject someone right on the spot because I felt that the whole situation would be even more awkward then.. we kissed a few times and when she asked when she could see me again I just said that we will have to make plans soon. I already know I’m the asshole here but how to mitigate the damage, do I ghost her?

"Question for men and women who claim sex is all we care about and not a serious relationship. I want to ask a sincere question to all ages from 13 and older.   

I frequently hear how hard it is  to find someone who wants a relationship instead of a one night stand or friends with benefit.       

The place one looks for a partner plays an important part of finding what we truly desire.       In many cases,  the church is most often the place people go to for a genuine, long-lasting partner.   The church is a place not only about people struggling in their faith, to worship and come together as one  but also for those who want their partner to respect their body.   

It is considered a sin to have sex outside of marriage     at most churches.  Some churches are okay with having sex before marriage with some constructive guidelines.   

If you are the type looking for something real and long lasting, serious and fulfilling, you might want to give the church a chance if you haven’t already.

"Too many bad experiences…should I just give up? I’m a girl in my early twenties and have tried dating countless times but each time it always falls apart before a first or even second date. One only wanted me for sex and got mad that I didn’t sleep with him immediately so he ghosted me, another I talked to for a few weeks and I found out she was talking and openly flirting with other people too and when I confronted her about it she said “I’m keeping my options open in case you don’t work out” and “I’m not gonna stop talking to other people just for you”. Another girl “forgot” to tell me she had a long term boyfriend who was allowing her to have a side chick and never disclosed it with me till the first date, another person was a walking pile of red flags and liked to hangout at strip clubs and wanted to get pregnant immediately, was already divorced at 21, and smoked like a chimney. The next one also “forgot” to tell me she was engaged and always thought she might be bi but wanted to have a one night stand with a girl to experiment with the fiancé’s blessing and didn’t tell me until weeks in. The last one just never wanted to speak to me and kept making up excuses to never wanting to meet up and I took the hint and backed off and haven’t spoken to them since. I wondered if maybe I was the problem and became super self conscious thinking maybe I’m too weird? Too talkative? Too awkward? I already know I have a hard time making friends, as I’m a bit introverted and just moved to this city and I don’t leave my place other than going to work or running errands and I don’t drive either so I’m used to just keeping to myself and walking around the city alone. I’ve had many jobs but was never able to make a friend close enough to hangout outside of work and always thought maybe I’m the weird one. Basically the only way I’ve tried to get dates is on tinder but if you know lesbian tinder (I’m pan) then you know it’s mostly straight girls looking to “experiment” (aka be my bestie but kiss and eat me out on occasion) or couples wanting you to join their threesome or ig in my case a couple girls who never mentioned they had a whole ass relationship. The last one really destroyed me and I keep wondering if it’s even worth it or maybe I should change my approach. Usually if a friend or someone asks why I’m single I share my last few attempts and they say “oh I don’t blame you”. Like what’s even the point? I’m lonely and I wanna try again but I feel like I’m just gonna get the same outcome. What should I do?


Edit: Thanks a lot for the advice and I’ve been working with my therapist who helped me to discover a lot of my loner habits (not going outside much, not speaking to people, rarely leaving the comfort of my room, etc) were side effects of my recent depression and it’s something I’m trying my best to work on.

"Setup a date and now im terrified Alright a bit of backstory, I am 24(M). Matched with a really pretty girl on tinder and we messaged for a min and she gave me her snap and number. We been texting each other for 2 days now and we have texted quite a bit and she is very funny and I feel the banter is really good. Now even though im 24 I am very shy. I have been on very few dates and am always awkward. The thing is I have never been on a date with a girl from tinder or any dating app. I get a fair amount of matches most of them girls I find attractive but never make a move. Considering she messaged me and we kinda hit it off I setup a date just a week from now. 

Now even though im shy I know how to talk to woman and have always been told im funny. The thing is I have to be comfortable with them. Also the biggest thing is I more comfortable as I know the person has seen me in person whereas here we have only seen pictures, I do have a fear of her being disappointed in my looks or smth, I dont know why, I look like my pictures but its still a thing with me. 

Also this may sound really dumb but I have seen quite a few posts about ppl talking with bots and not knowing. Considering I been pushing myself and trying to make plans and meet up with up them when im known to make excuses to not go out I feel like if this is not a really person I might never do this again. It sounds stupid but with AI and other posts being made I just dont know. My reasoning which my friend has told me never say is that she was just really pretty and I dont know if she would be messaging me. She gave me her number and snap and I dont want to really ask her for a photo cuz it seems weird but she has a snapscore higher than I liked to admit so I dont know.

But... understandably, it's made dating hard. It attracts some strange types... Small off-hand comments that would seem fine to anyone else grind my gears, because I can't tell if they're attracted to me or to the perception of innocence. ""You're so small,"" ""You're the perfect size for me,"" ""The innocent ones are always the kinkiest,"" ""You're just so adorable and feisty.""

Things are going ok except for somethings he says that kind of leave me a bit speechless cause he has a lot of “preferences”. I try to work out as much as I can (trying to get that booty gains) but my work is very exhausting. I am still trying my best nonetheless, but my bf would say things like “I like it when your butt was firmer, that’s just my preference” knowing that I don’t have a whole lot of time to go to the gym consistently, but it does kind of downplay my efforts and it makes me feel a little insecure. I told him in a joking cute way “you should like my butt regardless of it’s firm and when it’s a little jiggly cause it’s my booty”. But he said it’s his preference and he’s allowed to have preferences. But idk how to respond to him when he said it’s his preference except for “ok”.

I have tattoos and when I travel I like to collect little tattoos from places I’ve visited, we are about to go on our first trip together and I said I am thinking of maybe getting a tattoo. He said no don’t do it because the amount I have right now is enough. When he said that, it was giving me controlling vibes so I asked him to clarify. He said it is his preference that I don’t get anymore but he won’t stop me from doing what I want. So I just said ok, cause again idk how to respond to that.

Another situation was when I needed to change my shower head in my bathroom. I’m pretty independent and I’m used to doing things myself, I bought a new shower head from Amazon and was about to install it myself until he said “no, let me do it, don’t be too much of a handywoman”. That threw me off a little and I said why not? I’m used to being the handywoman because I live alone. But he insists on doing it for me so I had to wait a couple of days for him to visit me to change it out. 

Am I thinking too much into this and maybe this is actually normal? I am feeling really confused. Please let me know what you guys think.",DaiLo4Lyfe,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jfmik/my_bfs_preferences_leave_me_confused/,1691294191.0,0.71
"Is this why I’m single? Wondering if I’m single because I’m short, chubby, divorced and have two kids? I got pregnant young. 20 to be exact. My kids have the same dad and we only got married because of peer pressure once I got pregnant with our second child. I regretted it literally same day I did it so seemed inevitable we’d get divorced and almost two years later we did in fact get divorced. He moved on pretty quick and is engaged to be married next June. I’ve done a lot of working on myself in the last two years and have dated casually. I got into a relationship that lasted 9 months but I ended it because of some issues he’d been having. I know I’m not undesirable completely, (I have lots of sexual offers) but I haven’t had much luck in the department of actually finding someone who wants to seriously date. There have been a few but I don’t typically find them super attractive and then our sexual compatibility is off so it doesn’t typically go anywhere.

"Why do people say to “love yourself” before someone else can love you? I’m a young guy (21) and anytime I get irritated with how fucking hard dating is ppl always say I have to “work towards me goals, stable myself and love myself” before I can date anyone. The reason I think this is dogshit and I’m questioning it is because I know people that dated, married and had kids w someone they met in high school and are still together. My college roomate and arguably best friend met his girlfriend or I guess fiancé. Our second semester of college and they’re still together.

"Things were going fast while dating and she wants to slow things down, I need advice A girl (21F) And I (23M) used to date recently came back into my life apologized for passing me up in the past, she was going through some personal stuff, and said that I was the most genuine guy that she talked to and she confided in me because she needed someone to talk to. She seemed genuine so I talked to her for a bit and told her I would be happy to be friends with her so we started talking again. Talking to eachother we both found out spark again and we had a lot of chemistry talking to eachother. The conversations started to get more and more flirty and I have a side by side at my house so I offered to take her out and ride around with her. She said yes and she was very excited to spend time with me and I was excited too. I picked her up and I was planning on keeping things somewhat casual. 

We held hands on the ride and went back to my house and watched a movie and where things started to go fast. We started cuddling which led to kissing and making out. We didn't have sex or anything because I was just really enjoying cuddling with her and didn't want to push it. My friend had a wedding reception that night which she ended up going to with me and we were pretty much attached to eachother the whole time and after we went to her place. We did the same stuff but we eventually had a talk that she was worried that we were going to fast and maybe we should slow down and spend more time together in person but she does really like me and had an amazing night. She was very caring and affectionate when talking to me and I told her I understood and it was getting late so I ended up going home. 

She is honestly one of the sweetest most caring girls I've ever been with and we are still going to spend time together but I really don't want to mess this up by doing something stupid. We were both high when we had our talk so my brain wasn't working 100 percent so I'm still a little confused on what she needs right now exactly. I was thinking I'd message her and asking her because we are both sober now but I don't want to annoy her with all these questions.

"online relationship, advice please This is a long story of an online relationship. 

There's this girl I met on Instagram, she once replied to my story and we started talking a lot, at a point where we shared things about our lives and got related to each other in many ways ( her dad's presence in her life is almost non-existent except for providing her with food and my dad passed away sometime before). Shes had a very cruel childhood I don't wanna disclose it here but it has had her scared of men in general (*according to her*) but that's not the issue with us tho, I think I broke that barrier and did well and made her feel safe about it. As the time passed I started liking her and she liked me back and then one day she said she thinks she's in love and I felt the same but we live pretty far apart, like a province apart. So I tried to dodge these talks for sometime but after sometime I gave it up and told her I felt the same (we didn't start dating, we only admitted our feelings for eachother) it went well but I was still concerned about the distance and didn't want to start talking about it and I still wanted to date her even if it was online and she seemed to be into it too. 

Now things took a little turn, as the time passed I really grew into it and started loving, caring and thinking about her all the time. She seemed to have the same effect but we were still not dating even though I was definitely gonna ask her in a few days. She had told me earlier that she really liked dancing but then suddenly that day she told me that there's a dance competition in her school, a pretty big one and she was going to compete. Then the next day she told me that the dance had guys in it too and many moves require them doing dance together like lifting the girl and stuff. i told her she didn't need to tell me and it's alright, it's just dancing but she then said she doesn't feel comfortable with it, I tried to encourage her first but she seemed to not be wanting to so I told her it's alright if she doesn't want to then but she said it's a pretty big moment for her too and she can't just skip it for being uncomfortable or anything so I encouraged her again and she decided that she will do it now.

 Then something seemed a bit off to me, as days passed they kept doing practice sessions in school and I used to ask her how it she'll say it was great and enjoyed it quite a alot but there was something off about her she didn't seem to talk like she used to, late replies and not adding anything to the convos, it was okay for me I thought she must be tired by all the practice sessions or anything but then one day I asked her about the practice a bit more and about her male dance partner   and she praised him a lot, said he's a really good guy who respects her and all, i was happy for her as she had told me she was afraid of men, I thought this would be nice...

And then was the day of competition, when she got home she shared some pictures... there were like a lot of them with her dance partner, in one picture she was fixing his eyelashes ig and in another he was fixing her heels and a lot many like it.. I didn't judge her or anything but I've got to admit I got really jealous for I wanted to do those things with her but I wasn't able to. my mood went off and I didn't tell her anything but she noticed and then she said she's sorry for sending me those pictures if it turned my mood off and she had me back at it. The competition was over and i doing good but her late replies didn't change one bit, I even asked her why she does she told me her family interrupts and other excuses and also she used to fall asleep at night in middle of conversations( that's what she told used to tell me ... but I didn't believe it totally). it went like that for quite a few days and one day I put on a Batman pfp on Instagram and she asked me if I was matching it with anyone, apparently it was a part of matching couple Batman and Catwoman photo pfp. i told her no it's just random and asked her if she'd want to match pfps she said nah not yet.

Almost a week later she changed her pfp and she was wearing the same dress as on the dance competition and there was a bit of someone's head coming next to her. I downloaded the pic and erased that head so it would look a bit better and sent to her, thought she'd want to use that one.. she seemed startled and said ""yeah I wanted to keep it as a pfp but that head was coming between and I couldn't erase it myself"" i was like alright  but just a minute she didn't change her pfp still and I realised I have seen that head somewhere, it was her dance partner. i quickly went to his Instagram and guess what they were matching profile pictures with their own photo.

i didn't know what to say.. i just texted her ""why? why do this to me?"" she reacted like she didn't know. i sent her a screenshot of his profile. I could barely type... my hands were shaking.
then she started to explain, she said that his girlfriend had cheated on him so he asked her to match pfps with him so that he could get revenge on her by making her jealous. didn't make sense to me but I kept calm about it and asked why did she lie first then.. she said she wanted to keep that as pfp earlier and didn't even mention him. she said yes that's what she wanted but the guy saw her pfp and got an idea out of it... but it was basically just a few minutes apart that I asked her this there's no way the guy saw it so quickly and had an idea and even talked to her about matching pfps in such short time... i didn't believe it and asked her is she's lying... she started crying and said im accusing her of cheating and said that it's just a photo she only loves me and she has never shared so much or talked to anyone like she did with me. i didn't know what else to get out of this but I never wanted to see her cry so I let it be, the pfp is still like that. We talked awkwardly for sometime but I had my peace with it after like a two days and started talking normally to her. then five days ago she tells me that because they won first position in school they're now going to perform again somewhere, I was happy for her and that's what I showed her but deep down... i didn't really want it to happen again to me, I knew I was gonna feel really bad and jealous again. The performance was today, they won again but she again had many of pictures with him and just the same as last time, I have her other friends Instagrams too, those who participated in the competition they don't seem anything at all like these too and in the morning she said she couldn't get a ride so her dance partner picked her and dropped her back home too on his bike... 
I was thinking of dating her and meeting her at some point, she has told me the same.. even today.. 

but I don't like this at all.. is she just very friendly or is there something else to it? because I can't take this anymore, this is strangely painful, I have never felt like this before. i didn't say anything to her but I feel incredibly low. 
what should I do?... i still love her... a lot.. i don't know if it's just me but it's hurting me a lot and I don't know why she can see it.  
if this is how she's going to be, I'm always going to be in pain. Should I stop it with her or am I overreacting?

"Blunder on first date - closing doors after I (33F) recently matched with someone (34M) and we really hit it off - banter, deep conversations, voice memos, you name it. We had set a time and date to meet up, and the first date was quite chaotic and overwhelming (for one, I arrived to meet him for the first time and he was sitting outside with his parents - let's just say that I was a little overwhelmed throughout the night).  
  
We had a coffee the morning after and things were quite alright. I wasn't necessarily under the impression that we would continue at the pace we'd started, but I thought to myself, ""Many first dates are awkward, some are entirely awful, but we have had a great connection and I would love to meet up again and feel more like myself"".  
  
Well, a day passed, and I didn't hear from him. He reached out to tell me that it wasn't ""quite the right match"" for him, and that's okay. So I asked what he thought I wanted from him, and he said, ""Well, you made jokes about the future about an hour into our date, and it seemed like you wanted to be exclusive, so you came on way too strong for my liking"".  
  
But here's the thing: A lot of our banter had been characterized by jokes about the future (which were designated as such). In part due to so many many things happening all at once, I had joked about this a little more (e.g., when he told me he was talking to other people, I was like ""why? I exist!""), thinking it was obvious that I wouldn't want to jump into anything right off the bat. It honestly was just a joke, and it didn't come out of nowhere - there had been a precedent to which he'd contributed.  
  
We talked more yesterday and I mentioned that I would have liked to roll things back and feel things out. I don't go on a first date to decide if I want to be exclusive with someone. He said that once such ""blunders"" happen, in the context of sexual and romantic connections, he will close the door on it and never consider that outlook again. But he will consider friendship. Now, that seemed completely reasonable to me, but I've since thought about it more and some things are not sitting right with me.  
  
\- First, when it comes to friendship: People are human, and humans make mistakes. And mistakes happen in friendships, too - if someone is so inflexible with forgiving them, it makes me worried that I will have to police my communication. In the same vein, people will commit blunders in the dating stage, too, and I personally view them as opportunities to tap into how people communicate, how they resolve things, and the like. They will inevitably happen, and if they happen early on, it's almost like a litmus test if communication and resolution will be possible. I like to extend grace to people, because if we didn't forgive mistakes - obviously, we are not talking about severe violations of boundaries or the like - we would be alone.  
  
\- Second, he mentioned that (unlike with me) he will feel no connection with somebody, but go on a second date and try being physical to see if something could come out of it. With me, he felt a connection, but a blunder is enough to close the door on me. This doesn't add up to me if the goal is to date intentionally.  
  
\- He could have mentioned that I had committed a blunder before we got physical with each other (no sex, but things got quite handsy). He was also quite touchy-feely in the morning. If he felt he needed a way out, there was no reason to go through with any sort of intimacy.  
  
Overall, I'm wondering if people think that my blunder was severe enough to close the door on me; whether you would try to pursue a friendship in this scenario, if you were me; and whether you think his ""inflexibility"" with dealing with a joke taken too far is a bit of a red flag.

"Can I tell a girl I would like to date her and make her my girlfriend, but only if she lost weight? 27 y/o male here

Hey there, I’m probably going to get hate for this, but I am friends with a girl who is really awesome. I like her personality, she is very feminine, would
be a good mother and partner, emotionally intelligent, has the same type of humor as me, likes to go in the ocean, etc. She’s made it clear that she is interested in me sexually/romantically, but I have turned her down, because I don’t want to ruin the friendship, and I’m not interested in her romantically, because I don’t see myself being happy in a long-term relationship with someone who is overweight.

Sexual attraction is there, but not at all what it would be if she was at her ideal weight and tone. 

Right now, she drinks beer quite a bit and eats unhealthy food. Her exercise is largely recreational activities, which do not happen super regularly. Mostly swimming in the ocean and surfing. She is 24 y/o

I work out a lot, I have been through many health struggles that left me functionally crippled, and crawled my way out of the situation into having a very strong V-shaped frame. I get a lot of mental health benefits from going to the gym and moving my body, and can tell there is a big difference in my general attitude, energy, and how I feel when I get even a little bit of exercise and nature exposure in the morning

Being able to relate to someone who has the same attitude towards exercise, and has the body that shows it is very important to me.

So is being sexually attracted to someone over a long period of time, which I know will not be possible if she stays at her current weight. 

If she wants me as I am, in really good shape, is it not fair for me to want her also in shape?

Won’t say she did wrong but won’t even say that it was a correct way to end things. Didn’t even end things on call just few sentences and done.
I really wanted that relationship to work maybe I over expected a bit that why it is hurting. But now I’m in a situation where I don’t if I should start dating again or not. I don’t feel like starting a random talk with someone or even try to flirt. But every morning I feel like I want to have someone in my life with whom I can grow.

It's a shame that after breaking up and realizing he was a selfish man-child (and weirdly cared about incels), I still have a crush on him because of his looks.

"Did I mess up my date and should I still text him? I need answers! Im a woman and I went on a date with this guy I met online. We really hit it off and we have a lot of similarities such as football and music taste. The first date went sooo well, we went on a walk, went to the gym and had a couple drinks. I could tell he likes me from the way he casually touches my shoulder and legs (not in a perverted way) and how he always leans forward when talking to me and he always tells me im pretty and nice (basically compliments me) After that, we would text each other the whole day and we don't really run out of topics so he invited me to a second date. Even a 3rd date to go watch movies. 

So second date comes up, he invited me to his place and he told me he has alcohol to drink but it was like 1/4 left from the bottle left. He seems like a decent guy so I agreed. Before we drank in his place he always mentions pervy stuff but I just kinda pushed it off but I kept thinking about it. So I offered to drink more alcohol as I am not even tipsy. He was like ""okay fine"" and he went to buy more. After I got drunk and told him to sit beside me and I leaned my head on his shoulder. I started saying stuff like ""you're hot"" ""you're so big"" ""does it turn u off?"" And I guess he got uncomfortable and stood up he said he doesn't want to take advantage of me since I was really drunk. He took care of me and offered to walk me home. He told me things like ""you should slack back on ur alcohol"" ""u got too crazy"" while he was walking me back. I told him im sorry and thank you like a couple times and he said ""it's okay i just need time to process it"".

The reason for the incompatibility is that my BF has her life and path figured out(to the extent one has life figured out), she's built her career, made her investments, emotionally stable and has a clear plan for her life. She's very kind and nice to others. She forgives and loves deeply and gives her all to every relationship she has. She's extremely clean and organized and loves to do house chores. She is very traditional in her relationships in gender roles and very feminine.

The guy on the other hand, started one uni course and changed his mind two years in. Then he went and started another one(which really isn't marketable, maybe he thought it was at that time), finished undergrad and then went to study his masters and did a couple of 3 month internships in between. Thereafter his longest job stint(related to his chosen profession) was for one year. He then decided to follow his long term girlfriend(who had a stable, highly paid job and career) of that time to wherever she was and they kept travelling together with him finding odd jobs to do as they travelled. The girlfriend broke it off with him after 10 years together. He says she cheated and didn't want to reconcile. 

A few months later, he meets by BF and they hit it off. He seemed nice but slowly when my BF wanted to take things seriously, she starts noticing some questionable things. The guy is still doing odd jobs and didn't seem to have a lot of plans for his life. Then when my friend started asking him for his life plan, he said he's been applying for jobs but he's not getting any(at least he got into some interviews) , then he had some business ideas which he never really pursued, he claims to be clean like my friend but he doesn't clean up after himself when we've gone away for trips, even his shoe laces are tied so weirdly(it's really like how I've seen kindergarten kids tying laces). These were some minor things that my friend was willing to overlook but the biggest blow for her came when the guy asked her if she's ever considered having a house husband and he would take care of the house and kids because he believes in women empowerment and supporting her as she climbs up the career ladder. My friend said no and said that she always wanted a working spouse, a traditional setup, to which he said, ""that's fine too but he prefers having to split everything 50/50, chores, finances etc"" to which my friend said, ""then I'm not the spouse you're looking for and that's not the relationship I want for myself"" He just laughed and brushed it off and continued chatting away. They are still not officially dating(my friend isn't seeing other people but he's been out on a couple of other dates) but the guy always checks on my friend, updates her on his whereabouts, says he is ready to propose to her if she gives him a chance. His future plans with my BF is how he'll cook for her, massage her when she's so tired from work, give her kids, f*** her real good and would never cheat on her. To me, really this is what a 20 year old says to another. Life is more than this.

I think this guy is confused and really has no sense of direction. He just goes where the wind blows and would fit himself into someone or something so long as it works for his comfort/goals. I don't trust that he loves my friend genuinely. I feel like I should tell my friend something because the guy low-key looks like he's love bombing her as well.

"i met a really sweet guy So, I started talking to this guy on a furry app called barq, me and him are both furries, I am a F, 19 and he is M 25, we both went to the mall yesterday on a first date, my mom came along because i wanted to be safe.

We went to the arcade and played a few games and he let me use his tickets to get a prize i liked, then we went to an anime shop and he got me an eevee figure and a kirby one. 

Before we all went home we went for sushi, and he paid for me and my mom without her even asking. He makes more money then me and her. I really like his personality and I hope that me and him work out and become official. We're taking it slow since i start school next year and have a surgery soon.

But I feel like going on a few more dates with him to make it official because i really like this guy, hes so sweet, caring, heartwarming, and he is also a cat person like me and he has a big fluffy maincoon. 

we also both love paranormal stuff and want to go ghost hunting together. He works at EA sports and helps with the lighting and models at movies :3

"changed tone completely after sleeping together I (24F) have been seeing this guy (26M) for a month or so after meeting on hinge. After not going beyond a hug on our first two dates, a couple of days ago we went to a bar and had a few drinks and long story short, ended up going back to mine and sleeping together. It was great and for me has definitely increased the emotional connection but he seems to have gone the other way. Although we would only message once or twice a day before, I’ve barely heard from him since and what I have has been very brief and closed conversationally. 

Normally I’d just accept that he was just in it for sex and now that’s happened isn’t interested anymore but I didn’t get that vibe at all before. Even during the date he told me he’d deleted hinge and had told his mum about me and we were making plans for future dates.

The things that are unusual to me is the lack of touch, even if we are laying together, about the only time is having her arms around me while kissing or during sex, there is very little else.

Then if she is leaving, she states she is leaving, will give a small kiss and leave without even really saying goodbye, even though i say goodnight or whatever else. Basically ""hellos"" and ""goodbyes"" seem to be an issue.

Are these behaviours typical of someone on the spectrum? I would love to get some insight from those who also are and get your perspective on dating and life with autism in general to give me a better understanding of her point of view.

"how do i deal with a guy friend who’s making me think we have a skinny love?? help me not get confused.
Op (26F)

been feeling something confusing towards this friend from high school. we’re not close in high school but when we went to college we got to meet up frequently because suddenly, we belonged to the same group of friends. Now, were both 26 and still meeting up 3-5 times a year with the same group of friends (all of us are busy). We don’t talk at all via soc med — only during birthdays, before hanging out with friends and just some random and sudden urge to want to hang out together (don’t really push thru). But whenever we drink with our friend group, we would end up sitting beside each other, somehow stealing glances and help out each other out with some errands and to-dos in the most subtle and “intimate” way. 

The last time we hang out, we were sharing a pack of candy and it might not be much but i feel like it was sort of romantic how we would share the pack of candy. We don’t even need to talk before knowing which candy to get, we just know what to give and ask from each other subconsciously. He’s also very attentive to the songs I play (i pick the music in every drinking session) and he would ask me to listen or play a song he thinks is good or i would love — not even minding other people around. 

During the last time we’ve been together, before standing up our chairs to pack up, he said thank you for me allowing our friend group to drink again in my house (we usually drink in my house), then he asked me to do a high five with him but his hands lingered more than they should and he ended up holding my hand for a good 5 seconds, like actually holding to it. And our hands stayed like that for a good 10-15 seconds before our friends turned their heads towards us. Tbh, i think both of us didn’t want to let go. After that we went out the gate. We bid two of our other friends goodbye (theyre riding the same car), and right before this guy went to his car, he said thank you again and asked for a friendly side hug which haha lasted for about 5-10 seconds again. He kept saying thank you and good night too. I know he’s not drunk too. 

As much as I want to convince myself those things doesn’t really matter because he’s not even saying anything or doing anything after our every encounter, I still feel like there’s something there. Am i being delusional or? I can share more about our backstory (nothing much) if it helps.

I feel like i have a crush on him since high school but it’s so complicated these past years — he has a kid, but his baby mama and him are not together ever since, his baby mama is married, he’s a nephew of my boss at the same time.

"I really need a man’s advice 
I've been seeing this guy for four months now, and everything has felt so good so far that it worries us both.  When it comes to achieving success and starting a family, we share the same sentiments and objectives. Last night, we even had a deeper conversation during which we both felt connected, and everything felt just right. While we were snapping pictures, my deceased ex-best friend texted me, ""Hey, you okay?"" (I only speak to him occasionally, and the majority of the time I don't respond since I don't have much to say, plus it's been two years since my ex passed away and I don't want to feel like I'm still in holding on to him) anyway the guy I’ve been seeing asked who it was and explained who he is and kept it short and simple… he said to me “red flag” which I was taken back a bit, so later on I realized he became distant so I basically just gave him all the reassurance that it’s only been me and him for the 4 months and that I have not and am not interested in talking to anyone else( I even have made this man lunches for work and even surprised him with a birthday basked that I made to show him how much I care for him and that I’m here for him) .

"separated from an ex-date for more than half a year, still gets anxiety from what he told me and idk the cause of it anw I was trying to book hotel for my family and I saw day-usage or hourly usage hotels and immediately got reminded of him because he told me he used to go there w his fwb or like dates there (although I’ve never been there but we planned once). I don’t know why I still feel affected by it after a year. Ngl, when he told me he had a non-active fwb while dating me shocked me that I cried daily for a year and I thought it’s because our values don’t align which was why it was the biggest disappointing news I’ve heard. (I know it’s not normal to cry daily, I’m seeking counselling and counselor said it’s normal to be sad over this, but the cause of daily crying could be due to emotional build up from young w my parents which I’m still trying to grasp). The feeling of sadness and shock still lingers in me, although it’s much less now. I just seem to be affected by anything that reminds me of him and his fwb, even in the smallest things.

"Advice on how I (31M) can introduce my older partner (47F) to my family. Hi all. Hope you’re all having a wonderful weekend wherever you are.

Created this post because I need some advice. I’ve been in a committed and loving relationship with a woman who’s older than me and been together officially for 7 months (I’m a 31m and she’s 47F) and every day with her has been heaven. I’ve told my parents about her but haven’t told them her age because I know they’d try to put a stop to it. I really want to introduce her to them so that they at least know who she is and maybe on the chance they’ll see how happy we are and change their stance. my partner shared the same worry about how my family will react to our relationship as well as her family will react to me. I love her dearly, know I want to be with her and will be together no matter what my family says but ideally I’d love for them to be supportive. 

So what I’m asking is, what do you think would be the best course of action in order to hopefully have the best possible outcome after meeting? What would you do in this situation? Anything I can do beforehand to mitigate/lessen the impact of a possible Bombshell of news to them? Any advice I’d appreciate gratefully.😊

"Are dating apps and online dating harder these days compared to 3-5 years ago? Or did I just age out of it being effective? So I'll start by qualifying that I (34M) have had good success over my 20s and early 30s dating, and that I know by no means is that the experience for everyone. I know many guys especially struggle to meet women and date, form relationships, and find sexual and romantic partnership. However, I'm a relatively attractive guy, at least I used to be, and I found that meeting women I was attracted to, both online and in person, was something I could be successful with. I should also say that I'm very very kinky, and in the past, this was something that would differentiate me and allow me to form stronger early relationships with women. 

I always found the apps (I've used all the major ones, and some less so) to be more challenging to meet people im interested in, than in person connections, but still somewhat effective if enough time was invested into my photos and my bio. I also meet many women through less common means - reddit, the popular poly/kinky app feeeld, fetlife, even youtube, so I tend to view my ""text game"" as really strong. I feel like I've been able to stand out by writing well and communicating upfront and early, and spending time cultivating my photos. 

Ideally I'd like to find a life partner - something really I've been searching for my whole life, so I am serious about dating. But I'm struggling. I can't really put my finger on it, but it feels like - post covid - something has changed with online dating. In the past I would get lots of matches with people I was actually attracted to, and I could have good convos with those people. Now it feels like I'm slogging, barely getting matches and most of the ones I do get are with people I think are not at all attractiveness matched with me, and the convos dry up pretty quickly (again, even though I've had good success with written connections). Through alternative sources like Fet or Reddit it feels like DMs are more frowned upon than ever, there is 10X more competition from desperate or rude men, and the women that would be open to meeting somebody through a source like this are swamped with people. 

Ultimately, I'm not sure if these differences are simply in my head, are the result of a changing dating landscape, or are because I am older and less attractive than I used to be. As far as the latter goes, the conventional wisdom is that you are ""more desirable"" as a man in your 30s, but I certainly don't feel that way. I take care of myself, work out, have a skin/haircare routine, so I'm not really much different looking in my eyes. And I do feel like on some level the landscape has changed, however. There is seemingly more competition than ever before on dating apps and the gender disparity is even more extreme, and most guys have figured out how to look good in photos, especially with faceapp/facetuning and the proliferation of media on how to look better on your profile. Is it just that at my age most 20-something's filters filter me out, and there are less 30+ year old women to make up for the difference? Is it that everybody has moved to social media (instagram and tiktok) for connections? Should I just focus on meeting people in person?

I'm curious if anyone else can shed some light on their experiences or observations from recent online dating. Have you noticed changes in the last 3-5 years? ",justarregulardegular,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jsi9q/are_dating_apps_and_online_dating_harder_these/,1691336043.0,1.0

"Feeling Unsupported and like I put in more effort to keep things open Hello, so I (24NB) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for about ten months now, and two months ago we moved in together. Since the beginning of our relationship, we’ve had issues where he was not fully honest or open about how he’s feeling or what he wants or needs from me or our relationship. Meanwhile, I feel as if I have more than put in the time and effort needed to create such a relationship, to give him space to be honest, and am not getting a lot in return. And it’s just so hard to feel invested or as if I’m doing the right things for him AND myself when he’s not giving me much to go off of. 

So, for some context, our relationship started polyamorous, a new experience for both of us. When we met, I had a girlfriend (with who my relationship also started as poly), and I was honest with him from the beginning about her and the nature of our relationship as well as my interest in him. She and I aren’t together anymore, and he and I are now closed, although I’m not fully convinced he wants it to be, even though he was the first to mention wanting that. He admitted later that he only said that he wanted to close the relationship because he thought I needed that. This has been a recurring issue I’ve talked to him several times about, about him only saying things because he thinks I want to hear them, especially when it’s something as important as whether or not to remain open. Since then he’s claimed to have been honest about the stuff he talks about but it’s hard to believe him. 

He broke up with me briefly in January because he (in his words) felt that he couldn’t give me what I needed, and admitted that he very often did or said things just to make me feel good, and that he just “coasted along” with what I wanted from the relationship. He said he suspected he was aromantic, and (again) in his words, my being perfect for him but him still being unable to return my affection or effort as fully had cemented this suspicion. 

And to be very clear, I have never forced or coerced or talking him into doing anything. Whenever he said no or turned down a date or whatever, I immediately accepted this and either tried to reschedule or just went “Aw that’s okay maybe another time”. And when he broke up with me, I was clear that I was hurt, but that I’d seen his lack of involvement and could understand why this was happening and wished him well. He then said he wanted to try, that he’d changed his mind. I never asked him to stay or to reconsider or anything, he fully came to this conclusion on his own. And I loved him and wanted to explore more with him, so I agreed to try again.

But even still, his efforts have remained the same, and honestly it feels less like it has to do with him being possibly aromantic (he’s since said he doesn’t know for sure if he is but that he knows he loves me and wants to be with me, so I don’t want to suggest that he is or isn’t anything that he himself isn’t sure of) and more to do with him, again, coasting along on my efforts. I plan the dates, I more or less got us moved into this apartment, I make the space for him to talk when he’s ready or give him the space when he’s not, I push him to be more honest with himself and with me. And I’m exhausted. 

That’s not to say he does nothing, because I know that he does, I see him making effort, he talks to me and is there for me too, I’m more so just frustrated because I feel as if overall I’m putting in more of the work and I’m starting to burnout. And I feel guilty for that because I also know he’s going through a lot mentally. 

This came to a head for me last night when I came home after a long day. And it was clear that he was feeling pretty down, and he admitted to feeling anxious when I asked what was going on, but that there wasn’t really anything in particular that he was anxious about and that there wasn’t anything much I could do to help. Which I understand fully, I’ve been there too. 

So we were talking about other stuff, and I didn’t want to push too much, but then he interrupted me while I was talking to ask if I thought he was an inconsistent person. I tried to ask questions to figure out more exactly what he meant, what he might be feeling or what he needed, but he just kept shutting me down until eventually he just said he wasn’t trying to “coax me into a conversation” (not verbatim). That he wasn’t trying to convince me to help him. I said there was nothing wrong with talking, that I wanted to, and that clearly he wanted to talk to, otherwise he wouldn’t have blurted that out. 

It didn’t really progress from there. He brushed me off and then said he was going to bed. And I just feel so lost and disconnected. And I get it that sometimes you may just want to vent, and that you’re not seeking help, but it’s not fair to blurt that out and obviously be going through something and then expect me to intiuate that all the time instead of helping me figure out what you need. 

And if I mention this to him all he’ll say is “okay I understand”, we won’t actually have an in-depth conversation or work towards solving the situation and growing closer or even just letting me know what’s actually going on so I don’t have to fill in the blanks myself. And then I’LL be anxious and a wreck and feel like I can’t be open because what if I’m just adding more stress onto him and being unfair in turn? And then frustrated as well because he’s still not giving me anything to work off of, any sort of meaningful insight?

Any insight or supportive words would be really appreciated. I don’t have many friends I can turn to with this sort of stuff and I’m just feeling very isolated. Thank you

"How do i bring up suspicion of cheating? I suspect my gf is not being honest. We do not live together and I found her handbag on her kitchen table when walking in. Her lingerie was poking out of the top which i found odd. So i pull it up and out and it reveals that underneath there is a pair of socks, a cooking glove and a one time use bus pass which is wierd since she has a permanent bus card.

To me the items are indicative of her spending a night outside her place where she wore her lingerie and handled a hot plate with her glove... for another man.

When i asked her what this stuff was. She laughed and said she did not remove her lingerie from the bag since she used at my place...2 months ago! I asked about the cooking glove and she said she ""just threw it in there"".

I brought up the lingerie again as i recalled she said she bought it for me. To which she again laughed and repeated her previous answer of leaving it in her handbag this whole time and added she is not into lingerie at all

I blew past it. Woke up in the morning and my gut feeling js not good. My radar is going off about the handbag and her response. It's not making sense. How do i bring it up again without stressing the relationship or perhaps how do i approach it without interrogating her?

"I rejected a woman and she doesnt seem to accept it So yeah, long story short a 19 year old woman visited me (M29) at work and knew where I had attended school.

She texted me a lot of times, which freaked me a bit out. I ignored her at first but then I rejected her. When she asked why I gave her my number I explained the misunderstanding. She then asked why I didnt want to get to know her.

I told her that I am just not interested. But the truth is that I'm also not comfortable with the age gap. Things went quiet, but now she contacted me again. I really dont understand why she contacted me again, when I was rejected her. But at the same time I regret the way I responded to her.

"Is it true that even pretty/hot/gorgeous women struggle with finding men? The title is pretty shitty and not entirely what I am really asking lol. 

I have a handful of female friends who are by society standards, drop dead gorgeous. EASY 9's on a shitty day. So, hot/gorgeous. They also have super outgoing personalities and have amazing personalities all around yet... all 5 of them have at one point or another complained about rarely being approached by men all while their ""less attractive"" girlfriends get tons of attention.

As a man, I can't really relate to this much as they are good friends, who happen to be VERY VERY good looking and as a man, my only theory is that it's because their good looks are actually *intimidating* to most men and, most men automatically assume she would either not want anything to do with them, or she has a boyfriend (how can a super pretty woman NOT have a BF?)

I am feeling a bit distance and not fully interested, I don’t feel like o want to meet him or have calls with him or get to know him.

I feel what turned me off that he wants to settle down and have a relationship (not with me per say, but in general that’s his goal) while I am the kind of person who likes to take things slow, discover people as friends first then asking them out. I don’t seek relationship for the sake of it, i seek the right person.

 I like to see people in their true color, as friends first. And since he has this goal in mind I felt like I am being asked a lot of “check box” questions, I feel like I am some sort of project and he is toooo carful about the things he say, he sounds a bit too carful and I like it when people are honest.

"Single dad looking for a companion Hello, 
I’m 22 and I’m a single dad.
Ik I’m a little young to be a dad, but my ex and I were engaged and both ready to start a family. Or so I thought. After my son was born, my ex lasted about a month and a half before deciding she wasn’t ready (we had hundreds of convos about having kids and it was her who decided she wanted one). So she moved back to her parents house in a different state and has not connected since. My son is 16 months now and he has been my number one priority since day one.

It’s been a little hard making friends or meeting people tho, so it’s pretty lonely. I can’t hang out with my old friends because they live the night life and I can’t leave my son. I didn’t have problems with girls, but now once they know I’m a single dad they kinda get turned off. So it’s kinda hard meeting people with me being a student and a single dad.

"Dear eighty seven, I think I love someone. Wasn't sure I was feeling love until now. I don't know what to do about it . I thought of penning my thoughts to get some clarity. She is 4 years younger than me, she LOVES to read. Shes a little dusky, which suits her really well. She wears braces and has reading glasses. She has great hair, which she usually puts up in a mid high ponytail which looks really good on her. She has a sort of baby-like voice, the kind which you can't forget. She has a beautiful way of speaking english, which was the first thing I noticed about her. The way she tells her roll number ""eighty seven"" in her cute little voice every day is something I can never get enough of. I love the way her lips go while she speaks, I could stare at them for hours. Yesterday we had a great conversation and to be honest, I can't remember most of it as I was busy admiring her lips. She does not have the generic features that make a woman beautiful, rather , she has a kind of character to her face. She's really good at academics, smart and kind. Most days , I go to college for the sole purpose of seeing her. She's both mature and also child like at the same time, which I find really attractive.  We have deep conversations with each other while at class. I dont know why but we mostly end up talking about mental health problems which at some point feels awkward because usually people share such stuff after they get close with each other. 

She's incredibly sophisticated, at least in my eyes . I am always careful about what I talk when I am with  her. I read about different books and authors just to make conversation with her. When I am with her, i feel a sense of protectiveness towards her. I haven't felt this way about anyone ever. We have a lot in common, we both are the oldest among our siblings. Her parents fight a lot and she hates it. She says her father treats her like a child, even though she is the oldest sibling. I also have my fair share of conflicts between my parents as well. Also she's an atheist, just like me. 

She has a flowery scent on her, like a rose or something, which might be from the moisturizer she uses( I'm not good with identifying smells tbh). I get that smell in my nostrils whenever I think about her.  She has a sister who has similar interests and almost similar personality. She do not have an immediate friend circle or best friend to hangout with. She usually hangs out with her roommates or her benchmates. I want her to count me as a friend, you know, one who she can trust or share things with. Someone like her deserves a good friend. I think she needs time to get closer with people. We share the same route while going home, but I haven't got the chance to go along with her in the same bus, as she leaves early with her girl friends. I have tried my best to board the same bus as hers, but it seems impossible after many failed attempts. 

  I have had feelings for her for nearly 3 months now and I'm willing to do anything for her already. I don't know why I love her.... I honestly haven't even thought of getting attracted to someone like her. She's not that talkative, she'd rather spent her time in a peaceful place reading a book rather than hanging out with her friends. On the other hand, I am more social amd I need company to vibe with. 
   
I am not sure but I have a fear of being rejected if I confess my feelings. I think she can bring the best out of me as she is serious about her studies and would want the same for me. I think about her while I study, enough to make her a distraction. I don't know how to act on this. I don't want my studies to get affected but if I go ahead and confess my feelings, I think she might reject me and it would be more painful than not confessing . I want to let her know how beautiful she is in my eyes, and how good a person she is. I haven't felt this way for a long time. I dont even know how I became so hooked up with a woman like her. Every thought starts and ends with her. When I wake up, first thing I think about is her. She hasn't even done anything significant to the point where she can even be considered as a close friend, but when you are in love, even the slightest of things are enough to make you feel obsessed with someone. I am unable to see any flaws in her and even if I do, I would love them anyway 
   

I have often tried convincing myself that the feeling I have towards her is just a crush and I shouldn't act on it. I have even tried thinking of things that I hate in her, but I usually end up disregarding such thoughts. She has one major problem though, it takes her forever to reply my texts. I ocassionally tease her and when she takes too long, I begin to think whether I have offended her or not. It bothers me so much that I take extra care to craft every single message before sending. Sometimes it takes a whole day for her to reply. At times, I think whether she hates talking with me, but I am the only guy in class with whom she communicates with. I often wait hours expecting a reply from her..... And during the wait, I think a lot trying to make sense of her being late to reply and the train of thoughts often leaves me exhausted; whenever she takes too much time to respond, I often blame myself for that.... I dont know why I do it but in my mind, its always my fault..... ""Did I offend her?"" , ""Did I come off too strong?"" , "" Would she be thinking i have nothing better to do than talking to some girl??......"" It goes on to the point where I pity myself and stops expecting a reply...... Then, all of a sudden, she replies.... And then the cycle goes on....


I know deep down that I don't want to feel this way about someone like her; she is not my type, she's introverted to some extent and also I am four years older than her and studying in the same class as her. I want to stop feeling this way about her as I know this might not end well. I don't think she's even remotely interested in me even after all of my efforts. On the least, I want us to be good friends but I dont see that happening anytime nearby. Maybe its best to remain a hopeless romantic as she is even more beautiful to me in my mind than in real life",Manhunter_15,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jr22o/dear_eighty_seven/,1691332294.0,1.0
"She’s a webcam performer and she’s asking me to watch her stream… So I (23M) met this girl online (22) and I genuinely have been having a good time 
talking to her and chatting with her, she proved to me she was real through selfies and we opened up a lot to each other but now she just admitted to being a explicit webcam performer and she explains that it’s reasons due to trying to help out her mother and family and I told her I understood, then she sent me a message saying “I just ask that you watch my stream first before we meet in person, that way I know you accept me for who I really am and not some guy trying to take advantage of me then we can meet up and watch anime or movies and maybe even naughty things if you’re open to that” idk what to reply with so I panicked and replied with “sure I guess I can do that” if we’re gonna have short term fun and just hanging out and not be too serious it wouldn’t bother me that much but if she wants us to actually be together long term and get serious and exclusive I don’t think I’d want her to be doing that anymore and I don’t wanna come off as controlling or manipulative at all and I don’t wanna get her hopes up and disappoint her so idk how I can tell her that, can anyone help me?

so I have been talking to someone for sometime now and she knows that i'm really into her. some time back she said that she wasn't interested and I said fair enough, which well it was. I've been rejected quite a few times in the past so really its no biggy. that however doesn't stop me liking her.  
  
the conversations will be things like her saying how I keep making time to speak to her must mean that I really like her and me responding with things like '\*jokingly ""I felt sorry for you as no one here likes you"" (and I can't express how much of a joke that is and she is aware of it.) as well as things like ""aah, but you haven't told me to go away so you can't dislike me that much"" and getting a huge smile from it.

I took some pictures of myself after going from 185 lbs to 165 lbs and posted up an honest real bio, and went to bed. When I woke up I opened my laptop and saw that i had received over 330 messages.

"M54 vs F33=is a life together possible? I have been dating an Asian M54 (I am European F33) for almost  2years. Everything happened kinda fast and natural (?!), we moved in together after half a year I would say. Gradually I have found out about his ugly sex addiction past, his messy divorce 10ya and cheatings and escapades he had done. He already has 3 adult children that don’t behave at all like “normal” young adults. Their relation with his dad is almost non existent. He has trouble expressing himself and his thoughts due to a whole life of hiding and lying (2nd nature I guess). He is also very kind, supportive and generous. Very conflicting nature. We decided we don’t want kids of our own. Just to enjoy a lifetime together travelling and making music.
A month ago I found out that last summer he cheated on me by going to a massage parlor while on a business trip. I discovered old pictures of stripers he had dated and disturbing texts he had forgotten for years in his phone. Still, because I love him a lot and we have a life in music together I decided to give him a 2nd chance. He wants to learn to become better at feeling and communicating. Still, my fear that he would cheat again paralyzes me. He has been putting efforts into going to therapy and quitting his bad habits. Sexually, it’s weird sometimes. I want more than him because I think he wants the same things. Very difficult when we fight to find out what’s in his heart and mind. It’s torture sometimes. I’ve started to believe we rushed into getting engaged a few weeks ago just to mend things?!

"I think I was assaulted, but I’m not sure. I (16F) and “John” (17M) are not dating but have gone on 2 dates previous to the incident.  We have not kissed, hugged, or anything. (I’ve posted before, but I got scared and deleted)

He invited me to go mini golfing. We finished and he said we should go play pool. During pool he made some sexual comments that made me uncomfortable. For example he was standing behind me when I took and shot and he said “sorry I missed it I was a little distracted” and made jokes how lucky he is I’m good with balls.

After pool he said we should go stargazing.  He took me to this giant hidden field and we laid there a little, he pulled out a vape took a breath and handed it to me. (I don’t smoke but I kinda felt it would be awkward if I didn’t, so I took one breath. All it did was make me super tired) 
Then I asked what he wanted to ask me. He responded by saying “how much do you like me” I didn’t respond, so he said “I know a lot” than he lunged into my face and made out with me. 

I was taken aback and I just laid there, then he started to feel me up. I had my hand on his arm lightly pressing it down, but I don’t think he realized. He eventually went under my sports bra. I flinched because I was so taken aback, but again I don’t think he realized.
Then he pulled my shirt and bra up and his face moved down. I was mortified and turned my head to focus on the trees, but he told me to watch.  
I asked if he was worried somebody would come out here (trying to kill his vibe) but he just said “I made sure we would be alone.”

I just laid there hyper focusing on the trees and sky, I think disassociated . He put his hand down my skirt, so I crossed my legs. he spread my legs and started to finger me. I tried to pull up his head by his hair, but I don’t think he realized I was trying to make him stop because he just moved his head down. He preformed oral sex on me. I wanted to scream because I was 100% not ready to do any of this. 

I finally after about 15min was able to say “I have to go” while pulling up his head and trying to sit up. He said “it’s fine” and continued. Then I said “my parents are waiting for me” and he said  “so what?” And continued while I still tried sitting up but he didn’t get off me. Finally i really pulled up his head and started to squirm saying I really needed to go. Then he said to check the time while still doing everything. I said I’m late and my dad will use his GPS to track me. This made him stop.

Finally, as we were walking back he held me tight and had his hand on my thigh and I felt out of body. The main thing I remember from walking back was him saying “good thing you stopped me when you did because if you tried any later I don’t think I would have been  able to.” 

TL;DR: the guy I have been talking to did a lot more with me than I was ready for without ever asking. I don’t know if it is assault because I never said no, and the body language I gave I think he did not notice because he was horny…? Also when I disassociate I tend to have a forced fake smile as my default face so I worry he assumed I was enjoying it because if that.",throwaway17377474728,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jjjey/i_think_i_was_assaulted_but_im_not_sure/,1691307609.0,0.71
"My gf broke up with me yesterday She broke up with me yesterday

My girlfriend (25F) and I (26M) have been dating for just a month. Despite the short duration, our relationship has been going smoothly, and I genuinely care about her and want to be there for her.

Yesterday, she decided to take me out for my birthday since she couldn't be with me on the actual day. However, during our outing, I noticed that she seemed upset and distant, avoiding eye contact and conversation.

Later, we went for ice cream, and she asked if there was anything else I wanted to do. However, she still appeared downcast. Concerned, I asked her what was wrong and if she was okay. Slowly, she admitted that she wasn't really okay. As a result, she drove me back to my car to have a conversation.

We parked in front of my car, and the conversation became emotional. She explained that she couldn't continue the relationship because she has a lot going on in her life, and she feels that being in a relationship is holding her back. She was struggling to hold back tears and repeatedly blamed herself, admitting that she was a poor communicator. She expressed her desire to remain friends instead of continuing the romantic relationship. I informed her that I needed time to consider this proposition since I typically don't maintain friendships with ex-partners. However, I assured her that I would always be there for her. Despite my refusal, she insisted on giving me some money as a gesture of feeling like she had wasted my time. I declined her offer, but she insisted that I accept it. Eventually, I exited her car, and we shared a hug, marking the end of our conversation.

At present, I am devastated and unsure of how to cope with this situation. Is there a chance that she might change her mind in the future?",leogamer97,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jjiox/my_gf_broke_up_with_me_yesterday/,1691307536.0,1.0
"My (M27) depressed GF (F23) keeps on saying she is fine, when clearly she is not Most of you would be reading my story first time. Giving a quick summary, my girlfriend had a busy span of months, assignments, exams, family engagements, relocation and other stuff. We couldn't really talk for a few weeks until one day she came and told me how overwhelming everything is, she feels emotionally numb, and the commitment of a marriage scares her now (fear of marriage was a case for her even earlier when we met 3 years ago, but it gradually improved, now its back). Having told about mental exhaustion and all, I reassured her, told her she os under no burden from my side and I would be there with her no matter what happens. She calmed down and we carried on. 

Now, the conversations have been dry, at times getting better, but dry for the most part. She still messages me first, sends me instagram reels if I am not awake and talking, talks to me daily even though she has a busy routine. Like she would be offline from social media all day but as soon as she is on, we would be chatting. Kept telling me about her emtional numbness, how positive messages dont make her feel anything anymore and she feels like she is just reading them. There were no heart emojis, response to ""I love you to"" would be ""ilyt"". 

Last night we were chatting, I told her we can go to therapy, and she was like ""Im fine."" (Notice the period). I did tell her that I love her and I can tell what she is going through despite her not telliing me. This ""Im fine"" ""I dont need help"" has been going on for a few weeks now. She seemed to have got offended, but ironically soon after this conversation she didnt want the chat to end and wanted to talk more to me. Last night was the first time in weeks she also sent me hee pictures, the chst ended woth her adding a heart to her last message. 

Is it normal for a person to deny her mental state and tell me she is fine? I can clearly tell by the way she talks that she is not fine. Those dry conversations. I mean we can say she is doing that to me only but I mean I am the only person she is talking most of the times, she wouldnt talk if she had lost interest right?

We agreed to keep in contact anyway because we get along so well and we have a lot in common. 

We’ve continued chatting frequently for weeks. It started slow after the rejection but well and truly back into positive conversation. Equal input, good laughs, emojis, sharing videos/images of our days etc…

"Best Places to Meet and Talk to Women IRL? Not a very original post I presume, but here goes.

I (29M) have been on dating apps on and off for \~4 years now, and I think I've gotten to a point where I'm tired of the swiping. No hate or judgement for anyone who enjoys it, it's just not sparking joy for me at the moment and increasingly, I bristle at making a whole judgement about someone based on a few pictures and quips. So I wanna start meeting people IRL. 

I don't drink, so I don't really ""go to bars"" in the traditional sense because there's nothing for me to do there, unless it's watching sports. I do, however, go out to restaurants to eat by myself often, and love doing so, and often do it sitting at the bar, enjoying the food and my own company. I do find myself wanting to start a conversation with a woman whom I find attractive, perhaps by asking the barkeep to send a drink over or something, but I'm particularly conscious about a couple things:

\- More than anything, I hate the thought of the woman thinking something along the lines of, ""here we go again, me sitting here minding my own business and some dumbass wants to chat me up""

\- Also somewhat along the lines of misreading the situation, perhaps attempting to start a conversation with someone in a group, and them not wanting some rando getting in between their fun hangout.   

Other info that might be relevant:

\- I'm a STEM PhD student who lives in a mid-size US city. Meaning I don't have unlimited funds (or time), to say the least.

\- I'm not looking for a serious relationship but I am open to it if it happens. Whatever the connection is, long or short term, I'd just like for it to be meaningful and fun. I've had 1 serious relationship before but that's over half a decade ago now. 

\- I'm the kind of person that has trouble doing things for the 1st time. But if I do it once and it isn't a complete catastrophe, I'm a little more confident for the subsequent times.

\- I'm short, like 5'3"" short, so I wouldn't say that I'm a particularly striking figure BUT my granny does say that I'm handsome and that I dress nice, so I do have that going for me.

\- I'm a terrific listener and I remember little details. I am, however, not incredible at small talk but I promise I will never enquire/talk about the weather. I'm not overly anxious about what to talk about but if you have suggestions, I would love to hear them!

What I would really love advice/answers on are what would the best ways to approach someone in such situations, and what other places would be best for someone like me to meet and chat with someone in real life? I would especially love advice from women. Thank you so much!

Why can't you just see someone you like, tell them you like them and then ""get to know each other"" while dating. You get to know someone more, the more intimate you both get.

To me, all these is archaic and immature. You see people on this subreddit saying they have been talking to someone for months and now going on the ""first date."" Then you see others saying they have gone on 4 dates and now planning a 5th. Like WTF! What is the use of the countless dates?

I miss being able to give my all to someone and receiving their all in return, inconditionally.

I simply miss being wanted for who I am.

With this I don't mean to say I seek validation from someone. I'm proud of who I am and what I do. I just miss that feeling of true love, it's special.",TravellingInMyDreams,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15j8ac9/i_miss_it/,1691273307.0,0.84

"How do i (22f) make my narcissist ex (27m) want me back? Help. I know that i shouldn’t want him. I didnt come here to be told to leave. I dont want to. I want to know how to make him want me back. I know im putting myself through pain.. So please, i know people on here know about narcissists, and i need to know how to get him to come back to me..

Right now he has discarded me for the second time.. completely just went cold. Rather cryptic with his responses. We have been broken up for 5 days now. Have still had communication all days. I know narcissists want you to beg them.. ive been begging and hes still so cold. Yesterday after ignoring me for a few hours he randomly said “wyd” then i said that i was just chilling, asked what hes doing. He says “nothing”. I asked why he asked me what i was doing, then he just ignored me for the rest of the day. 

Now, he promised me that he would come over today.. When i asked if hes still coming today hes just saying “idk”. He has repeated this process the last 4 days. He came over on his lunch a few days ago and thats it. When he texts me its just a few words, seems like he doesnt even read what i say. 

He has me blocked on everything except snap…I think what he is doing is “hostile withholding”.  Hasnt cut off all communication but is still being cryptic. He acts so cold then gives me a glimmer of hope, then goes back to being cold and canceling, then saying “idk” to keep me begging and wondering. I know its a game. He posted his new tat he got yesterday. Im sure it was for me to see it.

The fact hes giving me hope then keeping me on one thing makes me feel like this is just his game and he will be back.. cause i dont know why else he would keep promising he will come over just to say “idk if im going to” the day of…. Or even bothering to keep me not blocked on one thing.. Only reason i could think hes doing that is because he just is punishing me for wanting honesty after our last fight... I love him so much and im not ready to leave yet. 

How can i play his game back to make him want to stop ignoring me? I know its toxic but im not ready to leave, and i just need advice on how to make him think he still needs me or WHATEVER im supposed to do to reverse psychology him into coming over and not canceling.

However when I'm out and need or want to approach girls I just get stressed and not so confident when I see girls I find attractive.

I then see or have for example less attractive girls or ones bit overweight flirt me or even if I want talk to girl ill go up to them and talk as it its my sister with 0 stress.

Not that I always hook up with them as I don't really want to but sometimes do because I can.

But I never go for or get the girls I really want as I just get to stressed and not stressed and not that I even fear rejection I just feel like they won't be interested and even if they are as said its just easer to chat with girls I don't like so much haha.

I almost lost all hope to find a person who will genuinely love me. I found this guy who is my colleague at my job. He was always very polite and friendly towards me. Finally, he asked me out 4 days ago. I was very nervous. He is very confident man. 

It was a dinner date, everything was going in proper way. I also fell for him. But I am still in trauma due to something happened after this. He told me that he will drop me at my place by his car. I agreed. Suddenly, he asked me a question while driving. He asked, ""were you bullied by somebody in the past?"". I asked him, 'how do you know?'. He said I saw your bruises at the back. I felt anxiety at the moment. He suddenly started laughing and stopped the car. I will never forget what he said after this. He said, 'Weak person like you deserved to be bullied. Will you stop me if I bully you as well?' I was confused that I didn't say anything. He suddenly punched in my face and started laughing. I was crying in pain and was saying, 'please leave me!'. He was saying 'Cry more! Cry more! Beg for forgiveness'. Then he kicked me out of the car and ordered me to lick his shoes else he would beat me more. I was weak, I finally licked his shoes and then he kicked my face by his shoes. Then he suddenly started to say, ""sorry I am a sadist, I love to watch people cry"". Then he warned me that if I tell somebody about that night, he will release an inappropriate video (which was edited by him) about me on internet and will defame my image.

"Should I keep trying to engage in conversation? Hey guys - looking for some advice! I (27m) am very inexperienced in dating.

Recently I've become interested in a coworker (26f) that started working in the same company 2 months ago. She works in a completely different department, so I barely see her, most of the time it's just hi and bye. But we've briefly talked a few times and I felt a bit of a spark?

During one of our chats, she mentioned she's into F1, and that's something I've been wanting to get into. So a few days ago, I was in a good mood, and got the confidence to add her on Facebook and send her a message to have a chat about learning F1. The conversation was great and very wholesome. We were both engaged in the conversation and it went on for about 2-3 hours. It started getting late, so the conversation did fizzle out, so I ended the conversation by thanking for her recommendations about F1 and letting her know I'm going to bed.

Since then, I've been hoping that she'll message me to start a conversation, but she hasn't. I don't want to start it again either because I think it looks a bit desperate? Maybe I should wait a week or two? Should I have not ended the conversation? What should I do in this case? I'm open to hear about your experiences and suggestions!

"Nobody is truly ""out of your league."" Always shoot your shot bc you literally never know! IMPO, leagues don't *entirely* exist. They do but they also don't. I'd say that leagues exist more-so for women than they do for men only because men are way more visually stimulated than women typically are. in general and... generally speaking men tend to put more value on a woman's physical looks more than anything else while women tend to put more value on a mans personality.

Either way, everyone is attracted to different things. Just because you may not fit that stereotypical ""attractive"" look, doesn't mean someone who is ""out of your league"" finds that look or traits attractive and, you might be exactly who they find hot :)

Yes, you are more likely to be turned down if you are say, a 5 and are going after 8's but the easiest and fastest way to get rejected is by assuming they aren't interested in you and not even trying :)

"Does he like me back or am I over analyzing this situation? F22 m23 I could really use your advice and maybe a guy pov(?) on this situation with a guy I've been crushing on. There have been some possible signs that he might like me back, but I'm not entirely sure. I haven’t known him that long so it’s even harder to get a vibe on how he feels. Here’s the little things that could be taken as signs:

1. We were playing a game, and he had to kiss someone in the room. He chose me, but my sister made it very awkward by dying laughing (typical older sister lol), and we didn't end up kissing (even though I really wanted to).

2. The first time we met, I was upset and sobbing about something that happened earlier that night. Surprisingly, he didn't judge me at all and even joked about ""who he has to beat up"" 

3. There are these small, subtle touches between us that I always notice, but maybe I'm overanalyzing them because I'm already crushing and confused. (Like almost making his knee is touching mine everytime we sit next to eachother)

4. Once, while driving back from a soccer game, I got sick after drinking a lot. He made a joke about me having a crush on him, and I didn't deny it. So he definitely knows i like him. It never became awkward after that incident, but we also never talked about it. 

5. Almost every time we say goodbye after game night or whatever, he hugs me, but I've noticed he doesn't do that with anyone else. 

6. He always makes an effort to talk to me when we're with our friends, and he notices if I'm not feeling the vibes like everyone else. (Totally not texting each other all the time yet, but we're like constantly hanging out in group settings. )

7. Oh, and we matched on tinder, but I'm not sure if that's because we know each other and sort of are friends. 

Everyone tells me that I should go for it, but I don't know how and refuse to make the first move because I’m scared he doesn’t feel the same and I’m going to ruin the friendship that’s blooming or make things very awkward. note to add he is my sisters boyfriends friend and I see him quite often as he’s been tagging along a lot more recently. I'm feeling really confused about all these signals. Any advice on how I can subtly encourage him to make the first move? Or maybe some insights on whether he might actually like me back?

"How long does it usually take to find a meaningful relationship? I'm a 24 years-old guy, and have never had any luck with dating or relationships so far. Due to my past and some aspects of my upbringing, I have been a bit insecure when it comes to dating, and struggle a lot since I feel that women seem to be not interested in me that way, usually. To me, it feels that only desperate women, or women who have a lot to work on themselves yet, feel interested in me. The ones who really have a personality don't show interest that much. 

I shared this issue with my therapist, since this hurts my self-esteem from time to time, and she started telling me that how a big part of the population out there is in relationship with others just because they're lonely, or just because of a non-meaningful attachment and similar reasons, and how being a therapist when she asks people if they really feel good in their relationships, the answers she gets is no, and that people always tell her they are there because they don't feel comfortable with being alone, or don't know how to be happy alone, etc. 

She told me that I'm someone who is genuinely looking for a relationship that should feel meaningful, but that a majority out there is not patient enough for that and they get into anything that knocks on their doors. She told me that people like me either find such a relationship only once in life, or at most twice, or they often live single all life as well. 

This conversation with her had me wondering if it's  really that rare to find such a thing in life. She was right as in I would reject everything which doesn't feel meaningful in life, and would rather spend time alone.

I figured I’d only date men in my age group so (30 - 
35) unfortunately that’s not how it’s been working out for me!

Instead I’m constantly being approached by guys 6-10 years  juvenile.

Every time I find out their age I make sure I end the conversation with a simple “I’m too old for you honey, enjoy the young girls there are some great ones out there” 

Yet they do not care and continue to pursue, a boy followed me around Walmart, to the check out line and into the parking lot trying to convince me otherwise last night and I found myself getting super annoyed because if he was older I would have accepted his advances.

All I could think of was me being his age and dating an older dude and how that was a huge mistake.

Now im wondering what I’m doing wrong. 

Why are all the babies hitting on me but the men my age aren’t (they stare or I get an occasional, “you look beautiful” but no date offers or number requests like i get from the youth )?

I dunno, it just seemed to be going really well…we connected well, did fun things, the sex was great; and for a while he was really into me, talking about how much he loves kissing me and how we had such good chemistry.

This week he said he might be able to hang but he doesn’t know because he might be going up north. But no follow up, and I’ve stopped following up because I don’t want to be annoying or really rejected anymore. 

I guess I just realized he’s phasing me out, he’s over me. I wish he would just say it, I mean I’d still be hurt but at least I wouldn’t be wondering so much. I dunno, my feelings are just hurt and I keep trying to figure out what I did wrong.

One of the guys that would be there is a guy she has kissed with, not that big of a deal but still annoying. 

So I asked her today if she had figured out what she was going to do to night.

Which she replied to with “my dad is driving me home” that meaning she avoided the question and didn’t dig into it.

She told me later on that she was going home because her mom was irritating her, and i felt like that was a thin reason for going home. 

So here tonight she sends a pic where I could see she wasn’t home, and she then told me that she had gone to the summer house. She is apparently also sleeping there which I feel a bit uncomfortable with, thankfully she is sleeping with her friend.

"I've planned dates with 4 girls within the past months and they all canceled on me Is there something I'm doing wrong? 🤔 I've matched with these girls online and we've hit it off initially, and everytime I ask them to go out for a date or meet in person or something they're all enthusiastic and agreed and say they are so down. But the moment it always comes to the day of the date...they cancel on me kinda last minute.

I've been analyzing/reflecting and tried out different things between these 4 girls. On the days leading up to the date I do strike conversations with them to still keep them interested. I also experiment and try not to be soo ""clingy"" or don't really text them as much leading up to the date so I don't come off as desperate. Both methods don't really make much of a difference so I don't think it's that. 

One thing I do know, or maybe I can just be over thinking my flaws, is that I do tend to wear my heart on sleeve with ppl. But that's how I strike up deep conversations that can go on for a while. Its either that or I reveal my pretty crude and dumb immature sense of humor which I'm anxious to reveal when meeting people. 

I had a first date with one girl to then eventually having her invite me to a party with all friends. Had tons of fun and felt like my life was lively again (I was just happy knowing I could be social again, not necessarily because of her or my date) but then 2nd date planning came around and she just straight up never responded to me ever again.

"Went on two dates with a girl, both went extremely well but she is distant when texting after So I went on two dates with a girl that I met on tinder. Both times we went for dinner and there was a lot of chemistry and honestly everything went very well. After each date she would text me to thank me and to tell me she had a wonderful time.

However, when I try to keep texting her the next day she becomes quite cold and distant (short replies, long time to reply etc) 

 Not sure what to make of this and if I should pursue a third date, as I’m fine with leaving it as it is if she’s not feeling the connection but I cannot imagine that after the dates we went to.

"Is it a red flag that I bought a house solo and any future partner would move into it instead of us buying/owning a house together? Hi! I (28f) bought a single-family house a year ago when the interest rates were low. I live in it alone right now and have it styled to my tastes with my furniture and decor. I live in a HCOL city and most of the men I date are renting. Given the drastic spike in house prices, I feel like realistically any future partner would move into my place when we reach that step, but I'd also never want to have them on the legal documents, so that if we do separate, the house remains 100% mine.

However, I wonder if that's a red flag / disadvantage of dating me. If I were renting, I'd want a partner I could build a future together with, which includes buying and owning a house together, not me moving into a house they 100% own.

"Confused over texts. So basically, I never really ask anyone about anything concerning dating. But this one girl, is driving me kinda crazy and confused. I don't know whether to keep talking to her or stop because i may be bothering her  and she's not interested.

She's a classmate who also works as a nurse (with being forced to take extra hours) and seems to do a lot of chores. According to her anyways, so she never texts first. Ever. However, when i do text, she replies and we have convos for a long time usually about shows, movies and general things that we like, and the convos seem enjoyable on both ends. 

She also has a thing where she always leaves 
At midnight to sleep no matter what, even would leave a convo abruptly and sometimes she replies really late and always apologizes and talks about how  busy she is.

Now if she's not interested then that's fine and if she's busy that's also fine. I'm just worried that her never texting is a hint that she does not wanna talk and I'm just bothering whenever i text. She did say that I don't bother her when i asked but I'm afraid she was just being nice.

"Situationship nightmare 
Throwaway account because I think he uses Reddit!

Hi everyone, I’m going to try and keep this as succinct as possible, but TLDR I really need advice about how to move forward with my dating life after a disastrous situationship in my friend group. Sorry that this is so long, and CW for sexual assault. 

I (26f) have been in a friend group with this guy (25m) for a few years now; we’ve always gotten on incredibly well, shared the same niche hobbies, and see each other regularly at least once a week for the past few years. We’re always on the same wavelength, have the same sense of humor, same interests, etc. ALL of my social activities tend to overlap with his, from nights out to morning sports activities.

About two years back I started to find him attractive and we entered into a situationship. This only lasted a few months before I needed to go abroad for a while. We called it off there, but to my surprise I couldn’t stop thinking about him, so when I returned, we kept our distance for a while and didn’t get back together. However, our relationship was now much more flirty and sweet, and we constantly hung out. I was very certain it was one sided and that it would be very messy if it blew up, so I kept him at arm’s length and turned him down when he proposed we sleep together again. I told him pretty point blank that I would probably catch real feelings if we did it again, and that I wasn’t interested in anything casual. I valued our friendship more than a potential mess.

A few months ago the tension had become unbearable, and one night when he was over, he asked me out properly on a real date. I laid out the risks and we discussed straight up how bad this could blow up if he wasn’t 1000% sure he liked me. He told me he liked me and that he wanted more than sex too. We spent about three weeks having romantic dates and passionate, emotional sex. We kept it on the downlow because we didn’t want our friends knowing our business too early on.

Some important context here for this story: I’ve been assaulted before and I need a lot of trust to sleep with someone. Originally when we were FWBs, it was okay because I really did trust him with me physically. This time it was trusting him emotionally. I’m aware I’m a sensitive and anxious person, and he knew this too. I disclosed things with him about my past that I never told anyone else. He similarly appeared to open up emotionally to me too. Added context to this is that before I met this friend group, in my early 20s, I was borderline suicidal because of my loneliness and was incredibly anxious socialising. It’s thanks to them that I’ve opened up completely. I didn’t go into this situation without considering all of this deeply.

After about three weeks he comes over and suddenly tells me he wants to go back to just being friends. No real explanation, and he seemed shocked when I started to cry and ask him why. He couldn’t give me a real answer beyond a half hearted ‘I don’t want to make things weird with the friend group’, which I don’t believe. 

I was totally devastated and hurt that he jumped into such an emotional, serious relationship by his own choice, knowing how big a deal that was, and then pulled out so quickly. There was no triggering event- our last date before the breakup he said verbatim was ‘the best date of his life’. He couldn’t give me any real trigger for it ending. 

I spent months avoiding him, which meant I also had to avoid my friends. It was incredibly isolating, lonely and painful, because we had kept it so downlow that I didn’t feel like I could confide in my friends without making them ‘pick a side’. I knew isolating myself was only hurting me, so I started over the summer to rejoin activities and try to keep things at arms length with him. He had apologised numerous times since, and seems to feel guilty for hurting me, but still to this day won’t tell me a real reason why.

A few weeks back we had a big conversation after a party- he gave me a very expensive apology gift and told me how much he missed me. It felt like a beginning of our friendship being repaired, and it was starting to heal a little. 

However, a week ago on a group trip, he met a girl he really liked and kept kissing her in front of me. I was aware that we both were trying to get back into dating recently, but I was caught off guard by how devastated it made me feel. I thought it wouldn’t hurt as badly as it did, but seeing him act coupley with a beautiful, sweet woman literally felt like it grabbed my heart and crushed it. I’ve been in bits all week.

The worst part is that I’ve been starting to date a really nice boy (24m) (coincidentally we had our first date this week too) but I’m spending most of my time thinking about my ex instead of him. I don’t want to- this new guy is kind, smart and sweet, but I’m so caught up in my own pain that I’m scared I’m not properly giving him a chance. I got drunk and had sex with him on our first meeting but immediately felt guilty and awful- it felt reactive instead of proactive, and I’ve never had sex with someone I haven’t known for a long time. I don’t think I would have done it if I wasn’t looking for a way to ease the pain and make myself ‘get over’ my issues with sex. Ever since I’ve been having nightmares about my assault and feeling horribly guilty that I might have used him to try and distract myself from my pain. The sex itself was fine, but I’m kicking myself over it and feeling sick about the feelings it’s bringing out in me. I want to give this boy a real chance but I feel like I’m too messed up right now. He really likes me and I like him too, but it’s horrible timing. 

I really need advice on how to move on from here. All I want is to date someone nice and find a relationship so I can move on, but it’s starting to feel like that’s impossible while I’m in this friend group going to events / trips with him there. Do I make the painful decision to find new friends? They’re incredibly important to me and I’m completely broken at the idea of losing them all just because I’m heartbroken. Am I overreacting or did he use me for sex? Is my relationship with sex and the emphasis I put on it the issue here? Can I realistically move forward with our friendship?

"Was he right? Was I careless? A while ago I was dating a guy. It was the second time I came over to his house. We were in his room for a bit and he lit a candle. We talked for a bit and then we went to the kitchen. We cooked dinner and sat down to eat.  Right before I take a bite, he randomly told me that I should have put the candle out because leaving a candle unattended is dangerous. To be honest I completely forgot he even lit a candle. If I were a host, I would have put it out myself. I wouldn’t expect my guest to look after things like that for me. I paused for a second because I thought it was odd. I do agree that leaving a candle unattended is dangerous, but I wouldn’t expect my guest to deal with it.

Long story short, the relationship didn’t work out. He wanted to hang out again and I genuinely wasn’t feeling well. I told him let’s hang out when I’m feeling better. We made plans again and as I was getting ready to leave, he ditched me last minute and said he didn’t want to hang out because I ”never wanted to hang out with him”. This was going to be the third time we hung out…..I feel like the candle situation was kind of a clue as to how things would go.",littlemisscoolcat,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jft3z/was_he_right_was_i_careless/,1691294750.0,1.0

"18f 18m This may be a bit of a long story so please bare with me. I will ignore any hate comments regarding my boyfriends sexuality and choices.

My boyfriend and I have been dating since January now, and I know he is very much into wearing women’s clothes and taking pictures. It is not strictly a kink or anything like that but he has been in a few group chats where “femboys” post pictures of themselves in women’s clothes and basically other femboys or those who are into femboys, will compliment and praise. I did not find this weird that he was in these groupchats because I understand the attention is nice, and it never made me too jealous or anything until kind of realizing he has met all his exes in these sorts of chats. I want to clarify we are both bisexual so I am not against the fact he has been with men or what he chooses to wear. 

I went on his phone a few days ago because i had a weird feeling, I know it’s not right to do but the same feeling happened when I went
 on my exes phone and he was cheating. He had joined two more group chats and now was receiving tons of messages about the pictures he took, ones that he would just reply acting like he didn’t realize they were flirting. I decided to look at the pictures and even though some were just pictures of his face or him in the mirror showing his abs, a lot
 were of him in fishnets, body suits, in sexual positions. He wasn’t sending anything full nude but I kinda felt weird about it. I decided to wait to bring it up until today, which he got really upset that I even cared and said he just wanted to make friends and that I never let him have online friends. this was the first I have ever heard of him saying anything like this, it was so defensive and weird and i apologized and told him I just wanted to talk about it all. 

the main point is, i don’t know whether i’m just being dramatic or to jealous",ryebreaddddddddddddd,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15japyf/18f_18m/,1691279659.0,1.0

I am having a specific issue and want to tally the room.

I have been going on dates but a majority of the time, its endless messaging but the guy is not ""asking me out"" or planning a date. I have found myself nudging them or telling them when I am available after they ask me...but then no follow up.

I am feeling really shitty about myself bc of this. It's not just one guy it's several. Another issue is men are not asking me questions about myself on a date!

"The girl I started talking to recently admitted that she hooked up with a guy the night before Over a year ago, I matched a girl off of a dating app. We started talking, but then drifted off after a month in the summer of 2022. Since then, I haven't used dating apps or tried dating at all. I'm 24, she'd 28.  
  
Over a week ago, we reconnected, and we've had phone calls every night before going to bed. Throughout the days, we'd text each other and share stuff about our personal lives and grew more comfortable with each other. She told me how she was surprised that I wanted something more serious, because most of the guys she encountered on the app just wanted to hookup.  
  
She told me that she was only looking to date, no hookups. She even mentioned how she doesn't do ""Netflix and chill"".  
  
We made plans to meetup next weekend, since we had busy work weeks. We agreed it would be best to meetup for a few dates before deciding on exclusivity, but she claimed that even though we weren't exclusive, she was only talking to me.  
  
Last night, a few hours before our scheduled call, she messaged me saying how she completely forgot about her aunt's birthday and said she couldn't talk that night, and I was fine with that.  
  
She messaged me later at midnight saying she was hoping we'll call before work in the morning.  
  
I called her this morning, and at some point in the convo she brought up ""I'm gonna be honest with you"" and mentioned how she had been talking with another guy during the same time as me, and how he came over the night before.  
  
She said it wasn't a hookup, how they actually initially planned to go out after he came over, but from what she told me is that he stayed from 7pm to 11pm, where he gave her a massage in the first hour, which led to sex for the remainder of his time there. She said that nothing sexual happened before meeting up, how their messages and calls were purely friendly and sweet, but the meetup last night was mainly sex. That being said, she said how they texted more after she left and he seems sweet.  
  
She apologized for lying to me, and I really appreciated her honesty. But not I'm confused about her intentions.

"going on a first date, except i don’t know exactly what to talk about im probably overthinking but here’s the gist. i asked my (20m) coworker (19f) on a date last night and she said yes. my plan is to get tacos and then ice cream and chill in a park next to the river, all within walking distance of my apartment, and then head back to the apartment. 

i know first dates are usually getting to know each other, but with my case we’ve been talking/flirty for a couple months now, to the point where other people think we have already been dating/fucking, so i feel like we already know quite a bit about each other. 

we hang out upwards of 5 times a week, whether that be hanging out and cuddling at my place or falling asleep over facetime. a couple weeks ago we went to the city and i made reservations at a restaurant which she got excited about, but i never mentioned it being a date to her, even thought i kinda was just unofficially. we didn’t even really do the first date things there, we just kinda talked the way we usually do and made our stupid little jokes. 

but now that i asked her on an official date, is there anything different i should try to do or talk about? i’ve never been in a relationship before or even been on a first date for that matter so i’d appreciate any advice :)",iStripes,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15jepql/going_on_a_first_date_except_i_dont_know_exactly/,1691291349.0,1.0

She has been so confused and I admit, I fell hard for her. When I started taking initiative, she pushed me away and then started coming back again. This went on 2-3 times and then she ghosted me when we were to meet. 

3 weeks later, now I get a text of her apologising and saying she wants to meet me before she goes, if I would like to. She said she’s meeting dear ones before she goes.

If I was dear, would she ignore me? I think not. I saw her Instagram, she was out for movies, partying, etc during these weeks while ignoring my text of me begging her not to keep the distance.

"He says I am snapping at him when I’m not 
This is a recent thing he has started to say. We have known eachother 4 months. This past week has been kind of stressful in general for both of us. Today, over text, he asked me what I did today. I told him. 3 times I asked him and he ignored my question. Then I texted goodnight. He said “you’re going?”, I said “I asked you about your day 3 times and you didn’t answer”. He said “I answered your other questions”, then proceeded to ask me why I’ve been snapping at him all week. I really don’t think this is ok at all. I told him I am not snapping. I am interested in his day. It’s like he doesn’t want me to know. He told me “(he) isn’t keeping any secrets.” I mean seems a bit weird to me to come out and say that.  

Yesterday he conveniently said he forgot his phone at home while he went hiking all day. No clue who he went hiking with. I asked him today and he said 1 guys. I feel like he is trying to distance himself but he is kind of a crappy communicator.

"my (18f) bf (20m) and I are going through a rough patch and I need advice 

I need advice. My (18f) boyfriend (20m) and I have been dating for about 4 months now. prior to that we were very good friends and in a romantic situationship. We hang out in person maybe once or twice a week, usually for about 4-6 hours. he doesn’t have many friends irl but has a very active social life over discord. although I’m happy he’s hanging out with his friends, I wish he would make more time to call with me 1v1. Lately it seems like whenever I ask, he’s already on call with someone, so I either end up third wheeling or entirely excluded. I’ve tried proposing planning in advance hangout times but he disliked the idea and instead proposed we both work on communicating when we’re free. The issue is, he hasn’t been doing this. It feels like the only time he ever hangs out with me over call is when I get really bad mentally and essentially reach my breaking point. The thing is, if he would just make the effort to call and spend time with me over call/vc it would have a tremendous impact on my mental health (small stuff like that helps keep me regulated and not spiral). 

Long story short, I communicated to him that I’d like to call more, and he said he doesn’t always have the energy to talk to me online and in person and sometimes needs space “so he can better support me”, but he almost never directly tells me “I need some space” and instead just tells me “I’m busy” or “I’m already on the phone” which equates to me not realizing he needs space so I still text him.

Something that bothers me is he made it sound like it’s my fault we don’t call too often as I’m “usually the one to hang up.” That’s only true for when he calls me on snap and it’s unplanned and I’m at work or something. He doesn’t work right now so it really bothers me he isn’t willing to make or find time to call with me 1v1 when I have more commitments and less flexibility than he does. 

I’m starting to realize for the entirety of our relationship he hasn’t been meeting my expectations, and maybe I’m at fault for that for not making my needs and expectations more clear, but it has had a very negative impact on my mental health. It’s becoming harder and harder for me to see a future with him, but I care about him so much so want to give it time before breaking up completely. 

Another issue is, I don’t think he realizes how much this has been affecting me, and I need advice on how to communicate all this to him. Currently, we’re on a one week break (I asked for one) so I could collect my thoughts and hopefully articulate all this to him soon.

TLDR: bf doesn’t make time for me outside of hanging out in person occasionally, our communication is lacking and I’m unsure what to do",n00b2002,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15j2az0/my_18f_bf_20m_and_i_are_going_through_a_rough/,1691258587.0,0.81
"Is he nervous, or not interested? I (25f) have been going on dates regularly with this guy (25m) for about two months. He mentioned multiple times that he’s not seeing anyone else but me, and describes us as dating, but no one has thrown around the terms bf or gf or relationship yet. 

But I’m starting to have concerns. 

He is a very wholesome golden retriever type, kinda dorky but cute and sweet. He has really struck me as nervous rather than suave. We go on casual dates at pubs mostly having dinner and playing bar games on weeknights and have tons of fun on the dates, but we’ve had no romance or gone to a nice restaurant yet.

We’re sleeping together, but we’ve only spent the night together twice. He usually leaves after when we go back to my place. 

It’s a little different from past relationships in the early stages I’ve had because he never wants to hang out on weekends or spend the whole day with me. It’s not that “I can’t get enough of you” feeling past partners and myself get at the beginning of relationships. 

We talk every day and he’s quick to respond, but he often talks about his weekend plans with his friends, but doesn’t invite me even if he knows I’m free. If I invite him to something on the weekend, he can’t because he’s always made plans with friends. He’s talked earlier this week about bringing me to game night next time, but he’s still not invited me to his plans to see a movie and play frisbee golf with his friend group today. They’re always hanging out and he’s had plenty of opportunities to invite me. I am concerned that if he was excited about me, he would be eager to show me off and spend more time with me by incorporating me into casual plans with friends. He makes plans with me, but only for weeknights.

He also hasn’t gotten me flowers or other little presents, and he doesn’t flatter me a whole lot, try to sweep me off my feet, or try to take me to a romantic dinner, which is different from past experiences I’ve had. And I know I mentioned I like those kinds of things.

I think he’s interested, but so far he’s been kind of a coward when it comes to me. I don’t know if he’s just afraid and needs me to take the lead, or if he is just not that into me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy taking things slow, but I don’t know if these are things I should be concerned about for the future.

Sometimes we go months without  seeing each other. When I was there he was telling me about the things  that were going on with him. We talked about what we both like in  relationships. He spoke to me about what happened between him and his  ex-wife which happened years ago. He told me that he doesn’t want to get  married again. And that he doesn’t want to live with anyone again. I'm  assuming he’s saying this because of a situation that just happened with  his friend.

He was letting her  and her kid live with him and he was helping her and she assaulted him.  He’s also a type one diabetic and I asked him what he would do if he  needed help since he lives alone. And he said whatever happens just  happens. He doesn’t like communicating with people and he said that he  doesn't want to live around neighbors and he eventually wants to move an  hour away. So that he can live somewhere that isn't surrounded by other  people.

And he said that he knows  that he has to go to counseling. Because he'd like to start a business  and he'll need to learn to talk to people.He also does talk to me about  his mother sometimes like he told me she was sick with Cancer. And that  she has a nice boyfriend who helps take care of her. I told him men want  to date me but that things haven't gone well with it. And that I don't  want to be in a relationship.

And  how there are always some weird people trying to go out with me. I even  told him about a guy I met in person and he had bad hygiene. He told me  don't date (I'm assuming because I was expressing how difficult of a  time I was having with dating). He said he doesn't have time to date. I  did say that I've thought about getting into a relationship when I get  my career together. But I honestly don't know if that's what I really  want. He's been doing side jobs because he has to get a certification to  get a better-paying job.

While he  was cooking he was saying things like. I would order something but I  don't have any money. And when we were watching a movie he said  something like this is what I do when I don't have any money. I guess he  was feeling insecure but I don't know understand why. Because I have no  problem being at his place and him cooking I actually enjoy it.

"Holding on to the past to someone I idealized - Help Hello everyone,

Some years ago, I was with a girl I really fell for. However, it turned toxic in the end and it was a mess. But in the beginning, everything was amazing. I felt like everything simply clicked and felt right. It even felt ""too good to be true"". I was really really happy during those times like I've probably never been. But then because of her everything turned upside down because of her (she suddenly didn't know what she wanted and became toxic).

It was very hurtful to me at the time. But as years gone by and I truly focused on myself and stopped fully talking to her, I had time to reflect about what happened.

I think I feel in love with my idea of her and not actually her, or in love with her ""potencial"". Today I'm aware she would be a terrible girlfriend for me. I can see every red flag now.

However... the things that were good with her, were unbelievably good. I felt that instant connection, I felt like I could be myself effortlessly and I felt I could talk to her all the time and not get tired. And I've dated and met tons of girls meanwhile but it's hard to find someone with that deep connection once agian.

So basically it's been years and, to be completely honest, I feel romantically stuck in the past, but for that girl in that specific moment of my life and context and not the person she actually was and is now.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. She seems to be in the background of my mind all the time and I feel like that person I hold on to never even existed. Even though I've done ""all the right things"" to get over her and focus on myself.

It's making me realize how badly I don't have much support (his family doesn't know about this complication) and he has been struggling to support me as well. I feel extremely alone.
I also hate my job here. I want to be closer to my own family (even though they have their flaws). But in order to do that have to move several states away so we won't be able to be together anymore.

"Looking for some advice/insight on current situation Hey all,

At the end of July I went on a date with this amazing woman and we’ve been talking ever since.

She’s very hot/cold in her cadences and reaching out. One day she will be sending me pictures and calling me honey and on other days you can almost feel her going back to being cold in her messages. And I don’t mean like she’s a cold human, just the back and forth we have. 

Last week I slept over at her place and dropped her off at the airport in the morning. We gave each other a kiss goodbye and she texted me soon after thanking me for the ride. She also reached back out when she got to the place she was staying and was sending me pics and telling me what she had planned for the weekend. Towards the end of the night I didn’t text her back because I didn’t want to distract her from having a good trip. The next day I sent a quick text saying I was thinking about her and hope her trip was going well - she never responded to it and we went a couple days without talking. 

On Monday I reached out and we talked for most of the afternoon and everything seemed fine but throughout the week I’ve been getting that cold response/energy from her. 

I’d like to ask if something is up but I’m worried that would push her away so my plan is to just go silent for however long and hopefully she will reach out when she wants.

"My coworker I met two weeks ago been openly flirting with me. I’ve confessed my feelings and now she’s uninterested (I think) I met my coworker at my job two weeks ago and ever since she’s really hinted she likes me

Forms of flirting she’s been using with the likes of making secret language by calling some of our coworkers names etc and thus she called me Wassim (meaning handsome or good looking) she handed me the paper she wrote the language on in which I was called Wassim. Followed me on Instagram. Regular eyes contacts and smiling. When I told my coworkers I’m getting a haircut she said she wants me to keep my hair growing. Also said she now has a memory of my closet with the clothes I’m wearing everyday. Ask me what to wear on a night out. Asked me what I wear etc. It was super obvious she fancy me we had that chemistry I could feel it. I’ve also kind of flirted but not nearly as much until I finally confessed my feelings today. 

I’ve known she’s liked me for a quite a while now. Yesterday she asked me out if I’m coming to this party place she’s going to after work and I said jokingly “I’m gonna come but don’t get your hopes high because I might not” *laughing*. She later that night sent a DM saying “where are you”? And I read that in the morning because I got work.

Today, after two weeks I finally confessed my feelings towards her at work about how I like her and want to hang. Feels like she kept on waiting for me to say this finally. She smiled a lot while she answered “I tried to get you out last night *laughing*. And she said “I wouldn’t have dared to come up and confess my feelings”. I don’t think she said I’m up for it to hang out. I can’t remember. I apologised for not picking up the signals earlier but I’ve understood for a long time the signals she’s been sending out. She seemed super happy when I confessed my feelings.

Rest of the day she was pretty cold and ignored me unlike every other day for the past two weeks. Not rude but definitely didn’t give me the attention she’s been giving me for the past two weeks. It feels like she was really craving for me to get her flirting and signals she’s been hinting that she likes me. 

I don’t know if she’s mad I didn’t arrive to the party yesterday or what. Because that was the last day before her and me’s department worked at the same place. So we’re not gonna meet unless we meet outside of work.

"My FWB told me he is catching feelings but I don’t like him like that [NSFW] I (21F) have met my f*cb buddy (23M) on tinder, around May, but we go to the same university. 
Right after the first couple days of dates I explicitly asked him what were his intentions with our relationship and he told me that he didn’t want anything serious because he got out of a 5 year relationship a couple months prior. That was perfect for me because I too ended a relationship 2 months prior, and I had no intension in pursuing a new relationship. 

Our relationship can be described as good friends that also have sex. Because we activities outside the bedroom too, like going to the cinema, going out for dinner at new places or studying together.
But sometimes he would just stare intensely at me for long periods of time, even during sex, and call me beautiful. We would hang out at his place up until night, when I had to go back home (I don’t like sleeping at other people houses), he would accompany me and ask to sleep over. I never said no because I didn’t care.

A couple weeks ago we had dinner at his place and we had wine. There he started making jokes about taking things seriously but i was a bit tipsy and couldn’t focus on what he was saying, so ignored everything. 

After that I went away on a trip for a week. When i came back he told me that he missed me and I didn’t respond. 
He stayed over and the morning after I asked him if his intentions with me had changed. He told me that he wanted to get to know me better, then see where things would go because he’s interested in me. 

I was kind of expecting it but damn. I don’t like him like that. He’s great and we have amazing sexual chemistry but I don’t want him to ne my bf.

I replied to him that I didn’t want a relationship than and neither now, i don’t want him to get hurt by hoping in something that won’t come. He assured me that he won’t be but he still wants to keep seeing each other.
After that day we both went to our hometowns and won’t be seeing each other for 1/2 months. 

I really like having sex with him, but I don’t want a relationship with him. Plus I believe he only believes that he likes me because I’m kind of cold. I’m really independent, I like my own space, i like being alone, I’m not really affectionate neither verbally nor physically. And he’s been questioning about my softer side, that exists but it only comes out with a few selected. 
That’s why I think he’s confusing curiosity with interest. 

What should i do? Keep going at it? Cut ties? HELP!?

So,I myself 1.79 (posted like this on the dating site.Should have posted 1.80 and end this nightmare..),Since it's really bugged me,I just had to text this woman.After a couple of day's she finally replayed (This is why I hate dating site's..).I wrote her a couple of line's,saw that there is no response,Then wrote ""how many guy's you talking there with?"",Then she finally replay's (Prime minister..),she's like ""guess"",And im like ""I would say you worth a double figure"".We chatted a little bit and I dropped the bomb,Asked her about her preference,Now at this point I almost sure she's like 100% have read my profile (Not just went thru my photo's),Saw my height&amp;everything else.I asked her cold (I would never done it if not this situation..) what's your height preference,And she's like a little taller than me/at least my height (she's 1.75..),And Im like so im tall enough,And she's like ""Ya,you are at a good height"".

We spent lots of time together and would cuddle to sleep lol. A while in I said I should stop coming over for a while, he seemed surprised. After that he seemed to get distant and aloof around me (it’s getting worse and worse) he still volantarily hangs out with me, but unlike before when we could talk about anything openly he seems really flat and almost like his head is somewhere else, and doesnt really look at me like all. But when I mention other guys he acts reactive/ surprised, otherwise he’s like very flat. when I bump into him now it’s so awkward and he just mumbles hello, whereas with other acquaintances that he’s not that close to he enthusiastically greets them. He still helps me, is willing to join in my group for a four month long art project though he’s not in that class and won’t receive any academic benefits. I’m not sure if he lost feelings or is just feeling uncomfortable because he perceives romantic rejection from me or for other reasons. After I inferred we should stop for a while I didn’t make any romantic advances and just actively kept the friendship.

"I think i'm not attached to him anymore and i hope it stays this way (He's cheating on his girlfriend with me) It's been almost 21 days since i last saw him bc i've been on a trip. I'm gonna be back in 2 days and i'll probably see him again. I've been obsessed with him for so long and it hurt so bad bc he looks exactly like my ""ideal guy"". This is stupid but since i was a teen i had this fantasy of an ideal guy and he looks ridiculously like him. His face is exactly similar, he has the same haircut, the same piercings and similar tattoos and everything. The craziest thing is his face bc i've never seen someone with a face like that and it's just weird how similar they are.

But since coming to this trip, i've been able to think about him with a more clear mind. And somehow he actually seems like the most boring and uninteresting guy i know. Like every guy i know is more interesting than him. Idk if he's hiding his true self from me or if this is really all there is to him but either way, i suddenly feel incredibly bored of him. And i never thought i'd say this bc i've been so obsessed with him and he was all i could think about all day. And i was suffering so much bc i knew he's just using me for sex and he kept tricking me into sex.

He's actually getting more and more boring everyday. He used to say some sweet things to me once in a while but now he's just so sure of my attachment to him that he makes no effort to keep me interested anymore. To him, i'm just a replacement for masturbation. And this is just getting so boring. How could a guy be that boring? His whole personality revolves around the fact that he's a drug addict and that he likes rap and psychedelic songs and that he has no money. 

For some reason, i feel so disappointed. It's such a shame how a guy so pretty is so shallow and boring. I used to think his girlfriend doesn't deserve him bc she's so lame and he's so cool. But in reality, they deserve each other. I just wanna see him once more to see if the obsession is gonna come back or not.

 Idk if my detachment is real or if it's related to the fact that i haven't seen him for so long and i hope it's real. Or i might just use him like he's using me. I mean he's good at sex so i might continue to sleep with him just for fun. But idk if i can do that without getting attached to him again. But i don't think i will. I never realized how boring he is and now that i know, i'm not gonna like him that much again. He's just good for sex and nothing else.

"Love bombed by ex.. now ghosted? I (F25) just recently moved out of the house I bought with my now ex (M28). We were dating, not married, but he had promised me we would eventually get married, that he loved me, and we shared dreams of what our home would become.

 Fast forward to three months later when he told me he no longer loved me, that I was an obligation and a burden, that he no longer found me attractive, etc. and a lot of other harsh thing. I was devastated and couldn’t figure out for the life of me what I did wrong but knew I had to get out of that situation, as it was completely messing w my head and emotions.
That was two months ago. This week, my ex and I hooked up again, but this time was sweet. Romantic. Tender. He actually told me (and I felt that he truly meant it) that he did love me after all and had really missed me. The next day he texted me really sweet messages all throughout the day, like he had done before. Neither of us addressed what had happened during the break up because I don’t think we wanted to ruin the good moments we were sharing again. I had actually started to entertain thoughts of us being together again, maybe we could make it work this time.

Now, he’s ghosted me completely, so it seems. Left my recent message on delivered and no contact for a few days. Leaving me bewildered, wondering, what on earth did I do?? Should I reach out??

"Girl (25F) that I (28M) was seeing didn't see our ""dates as dates and just wants to be friends. Is there anything salvageable out of this? When I (28M) used to work at my old retail job, this woman (25F) would come in occasionally and we would chat and have a good conversation. I thought she was cute but I didn't do anything obviously it's frowned upon to ask out a customer (she also had a boyfriend at the time) so I just stayed friendly, chatted with her, and helped out when I could. Eventually, I ended up leaving my job to work full-time at another.  
  
Remembering her name, I decided to look her up on IG and found her profile. Sent her a message telling her I was the register guy. She didn't respond initially, so I figured that was going to be it, but she got back to me about a month or so later saying that she did remember me and ended up following me back. It seemed like she was happy to hear from me. We would talk with each other online pretty consistently and saw that we had some common interests and passions.  
  
Eventually, I told her I was really enjoying talking to her (she said the same) and asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime and she said she would love to. However, we didn't end up doing it until about 8 months after we started chatting. Something would always come up because she was so busy with her life and job and stuff, which is true because she has told me about it and barely has free time for anything. But when we did eventually get coffee, it was a lot of fun and we had a great time. She wanted to do it again so we had coffee again a month or so afterwards and again, we had a great time. We would also have video calls and I would attend some gigs that she was performing out.  
We tried to set up a third ""date"",  which was going to be a walk and getting dinner afterward. This never happened because it kept getting pushed back. I should point out that she would reassure me multiple times throughout all of this that she isn't trying to lead me on and she felt terrible that she didn't have time to do things with me.  I was ok with this because I feel like she was being honest about it. Cut to a week or so ago, she pops up in my notifications for a dating app. The app apparently determined that we were most likely to match. Finding this amusing, I told her about it and she told me that she has been meaning to delete it for a long time. I then asked her if we were going out on dates this whole time because I wanted to be sure we were on the same page about things. She then revealed to me that she had no idea that our dates were dates, that she valued my friendship, and that she wasn't dating right now.

  
I'm gonna be honest, this really hurt. I thought that I had made a lot of progress, but it turns out that I made no progress at all. I felt like I made my intentions pretty obvious this whole time but I guess not. Initally, I had told her that I was ok with being friends and asked her if we could still hang out. She said yes and told me that she really valued my time. However, after a few days, things started to really set in. I sent her a message telling her that I wasn't sure if I could go through with being friends because of my feelings for her and that it would be hard to spend time with her knowing that it would never amount to anything more than friendship. I said that I would need some time to process and figure out what is best for me. She didn't respond, I don't she has even seen the message. 

  
I'm really torn on this. On one hand, I do really value her time and the relationship that we've built over the past year. She has told me a lot of personal stuff and her mental struggles as well as the harassment she has gotten from other men; so I feel like she does trusts and values me. While we haven't done many things together, what small time we've had I've learned a lot about her and don't regret the time we've had. On the other hand, she was the most compatible woman I've ever spent time with. This is coming from someone who has barely been on any real dates in his life and has never had a girlfriend. So I really thought that I finally found someone who was a great match for me. To know that that wasn't the case at all with her is really crushing and hard for me. Spending time or talking with her might just be a reminder of that. It honestly makes me want to quit dating in general because I don't want to go through something like this again. On top of that, if she doesn't have time for me regarding dates, then how is she going to have time for me as a friend? If we were to be friends, then there needs to be an effort on her end. Maybe I'm looking too deep into it, who knows.   
I don't know what to do, neither option seems to be a great one.

Instead, I focused on graduating from college, getting my master’s degree, moving across the country and getting a great job. I am finally putting myself out there to meet guys.

I’m trying to meet a nice guy who is gentle and patient with me but I’m scared guys will stay away from me once they learn that I’m a virgin and never had a boyfriend before. I tend to be a people pleaser and I feel like a failure when I can’t make someone happy.

"I'm suffering with loneliness 😞 Long story short. Almost 23 year old bisexual ( but mostly gay ) man here. I have high functioning autism as well. I was never interested in relationships before this year, so never tried to have one. I became interested about 6 months ago and decided i wanted to try and find a guy. Fast forward 6 months and I've had no luck, went on a date last month for the first time in my life which was super exciting, but he just decided he wanted to remain friends in the end.

Autism makes social interactions hard enough as it is. But when I warm up to a person I can be very social. The loneliness breaks my heart, I feel like nobody wants me in their life. I want to be someone's guy, and for someone to be my guy. Please don't judge me either, I'm actually really struggling with this. 

I've never had a relationship, never had a kiss, barely ever even had friends. I have one best friend but he lives in another country and is straight. So it will never be a relationship and I can only visit once or twice a year due to travel costs.

I live in a city of 800,000. Not massive but should be enough people to meet someone. Why do I have to suffer 💔💔💔",ClasherMatt2000,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15j5xgb/im_suffering_with_loneliness/,1691267583.0,1.0

I have approached women in public but getting shot down is getting quite frustrating.

"Got ghosted after holidays dispite showing interest I (F/26) went on a date late June with a guy (M/28). It was a good date (we both agreed and texted about it after the date). We were both going on holidays in July, so he assured me that he would want to plan something after he came back to Mexico. 

I forgot to ask when he was back so I texted in mid July about it. Got no reply for 5 days so  I decided to double text, since he might be on the road and forgot to reply and I was going to fly to North America soon. 

So I aksed if he wanted to meet up before I left. He said he would love to but he returns the day before  I fly, so he asked what date I would be back. I answered, and communication ended. 

I didn't really care if we texted in between as I wasn't a big texter anyways, and was feeling quite secure about myself.

I was back in town this week and texted him on Thursday that I was back and would be down to hangout. I started become anxious after 24 hours passed with no reply, and then I set a deadline of 48 hours that maybe I should text again just to see where things were. 

So I ended up sending ""not sure what happened, but it was nice meeting u, good luck with everything!"" today. It's been half a day, and still nothing. 

I guess that date wasn't good enough to keep him interested. He seemed to communicate well before he ghosted, but the past 48 hours had made me feel like I wasn't even worth being sent a ""hey, sorry but I lost interest"". 

I'm just so confused that he showed interest in a second date but ghosted. Is it that hard to be communicative and respectful?",JGBishop24,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15j4qg4/got_ghosted_after_holidays_dispite_showing/,1691264646.0,1.0
"After first date, she was interested. I was not. We had texted through Hinge for a few weeks. Due to schedule conflicts, this weekend was the first time we could meet in person. We met up for coffee in a ritzy neighborhood. The coffee was good and conversation was nice but 20 min in I knew I didn't want to pursue a relationship with her. I tried not to do anything that would lead her on, I did hug her hello and goodbye because I'm a hugger but I did not go for a kiss or flirt at all during the date. I also only communicated with her through the Hinge app messaging and have not asked for her number. I stayed for a bit because I didn't want to be rude or mean, but once I got home (I lived 30 min from the date location) I immediately received a message on Hinge that she had a good time with blushing emojis. I sent her a message saying I also had a good time and I don't believe in leading people on or ghosting and that I didn't see anything past friendship. Reiterated she was a nice person who would make someone happy but I'm not her person and wished her well. I have muted her texts and plan to unmatch when I see she has read it but I feel like I'm legit going to throw up.

"Is there something I’m doing wrong? I keep getting ghosted Hey y’all, I’m a bi 22M who recently started getting into the dating scene. I began indulging in hookup, dating, etc culture last year, and it’s all been a learning experience but I’m starting to notice a trend when it comes to dating that I’m not too sure how to go about or “fix.”

I get tons of likes and matches on pretty much every dating app, and things go well via text 9/10 but when we meet, talk in person, or just do little
Ice breakers that’s where things tend to go shit, meaning I don’t get a text back lmao.

I matched with this one guy 3 days ago, he was very funny and just a vibe in general. He asked if we could FaceTime to just chat and break the ice, we got on FaceTime and we’re talking for about 40min and I honestly enjoyed our talk we both expressed our desire for exclusivity and we seemed to be in the same page, before our call he even said he wanted to chill with me. At the end of our convo, he said he really liked my vibe and would like to continue talking if I felt the same. I said I felt the same and I’d text him. The following day, I text him around noon, and he still hasn’t responded. It’s been 24hrs now. Before our FaceTime call, he’d respond within an hour max. He didn’t block my number or unmatch with me, just radio silence. 

And before you ask, no, I’m not a catfish lol. I don’t use any filters or crazy angles. I look the same way in person and online, I’ve even asked my family and friends since I felt like I was gaslighting myself and they agreed with my assessment. Only thing I can think of is that I may look super masc in my pics, but I’m not lmao. I’m not fem at all, but I not no macho man either lol. My voice isn’t mad deep or anything, it’s just normal.

Just last night, I hit this guy up on this hookup app, who I ironically also matched with on a dating app and things were going well via text and he said he’d love to chill sometime. I said I’d be down and asked what he wanted to do, he said he’d be down for anything then asked me what did I have in mind. I suggested we could chill in my car with some food and park at a scenic place to watch the sunset while we chat or just chill &amp; watch a movie. That was light night at 12am, he still hasn’t responded but he’s online on the hookup app.

"I finally developed a crush on a stranger who has been staring at me for months at the gym... Hello everyone! It seems like the interest is mutual now! In winter, I began noticing this stranger staring at me at the gym and that made me feel quite uncomfortable. His staring was quite insistent. Sometimes He smiled at me but I ignored him. I was in a long term relationship and had many other things in mind at that time. 
2 weeks ago, I entered the gym, He was already there, doing cardio, and started looking at me when I was walking by, so I purposely turned my head to the opposite direction, but I don't know why, that evening I started thinking about him, I started to appreciate how consistent He had been and reconsidered him... 2 days later, I met him again. This time I didn't avoid his gaze but I returned it quite often. We finished our sessions at around the same moment, I sat at the entrance and while He was walking to the exit, He smiled at me and then greeted me. I smiled back and said ""bye!"".

It has been 2 weeks and I haven't met him ever since. I became very impatient and anxious to meet him again. Yesterday, I believe I spotted his silhouette from afar, when I was walking down the street, heading to the gym and He was (maybe) already going to the parking lot... I was later than when I met him last time, I guess.
I don't remember exactly, but there has been a long time span when I haven't met him at all, maybe because I was hitting the gym only once per week.
I began overthinking this a lot and having this irrational fear that I won't meet him again... also because I might quit the town in 3 months...

"Do not get yourself tangled up in adultery. I made the mistake not just once but twice by allowing my heart to love two married women on separate occasions and received nothing but pain from doing so.  

Both times the women involved told me their marriages were over from being physically abused, raped by their husbands, defamed and abandoned.   

My heart aches for those women and eventually fell in love with them ( on separate occasions).  

But as time went on I began to become impatient with waiting for their divorce and decided to speak up.  

Both times, when they felt pressured to make a decision, they dumped me to continue their marriage with their husbands despite me showing them love, care, gentleness and support.    

I learned that adultery is indeed a painful situation and is why such action  is considered immoral and unacceptable.    

My advice to those who are in adulterous relationships, do understand you are not coming out as the winner but rather the loser in the end.

"I (33M) told her (35F) she was out of my league, she didn't like it. So I gave her the real reason. She didn't like it either. Tl;dr: told her she's out of my league (she is), also told her I never had someone and considered the ship has sailed (she didn't like that either), we both didn't like the conversation much. 

Heya lads and lasses.

I met this pretty chill gal at a heavy metal concert (bringing love and tinnitus to your door since forever). We kept contact as we didn't live too far away, went to another concert together, sometimes went out for a coffee or museum. We didn't see one another all to often, I didn't think too much about it. 

She did. While drinking coffee (well, she did, I took a hot chocolate, never liked coffee), she asked me out on a real date. I dodged and told her she's way out my league, which she is by all accounts.  
Needless to say, she was pissed. I thought it would just be like a rejection, but she really hated me saying this. She was angry not so much at me, but at how she got that answer many times over, how she wondered if it was really that or if it was just a convenient thing to say to avoid the real reason, and so on, and so on. 

She seemed actually quite hurt, so I listened and didn't make any jokes so she could just get it off her chest. Then she asked again if that's really what I thought.

Now, I do think she's out of my league, but behing that there's another reason on top of it. I never had a partner. Never was any good at this stuff, despite the whole self-improvement shtick and traveling and so and so on, I was never much more than the odd one out who could make some people laugh but who was ignored.

Why she didn't ignore me like everyone else is beyond me, but after 30 I was done with hoping and working towards love. That wasn't in my cards, so I gave up. I lived my life and life would be lived alone, and that was it. I'm 33, I'm not about to start dating now for the first time when I'm lagging years behind. I'm not starting with the whole trying, find out about how you handle relationships and what you want in them, stumble around with sex and words, while people around me are sending their kids to school. That ship has sailed. 

It's like I wasn't worth a thing in love before, and now, years later, I may be finally worth something long after people are done with the exploring stuff and settling down. Feels like a long-winded pity fuck of sorts.

I told her that, more or less. She didn't like it either. ""Why not just give it a try? For the experience?"" Then I asked the questions. I asked if she spent a decade without anyone showing romantic affection towards them. She didn't, I asked if she could guess what an effect this could have on someone, she guessed pretty bad. She was right, at this point we're in two different universes, she's looking for something I can't give. You don't spend so long alone without walling yourself off from the idea of live, that's what I had to do to be happier again. But that doesn't work with other people.  
She still didn't fully understand, I don't blame her, it's a strange situation that's hard to get without going through it. 

I asked her if I should have just said I wasn't interested and leave it at that, she said she didn't know.

"For the love of God, please stop asking this question. “What are you looking for” is the laziest question I have been asked in my dating experience and I will literately stop talking to a person if this question is asked. You cannot ask a person who you are just getting to know what they’re looking for. This is not build-a- partner. Most people’s “dream guy” or “dream girl” is completely unrealistic, hence the word DREAM. The people in my life who I have fallen in love with, took me completely by surprise, it was never something I was looking for.

"She ended things because she was worried I was getting too attached. What do I do? So I (27M) met a girl on hinge (28F) who I at first wasn't very interested in, but once we started talking I realized we had some of the best chemistry I had ever had with someone. She was extremely nervous to the point where she told me she cant eat when meeting people, but our date went really well and I'm pretty sure the feeling was mutual because eventually she was comfortable enough to eat and we stayed out doing more things than we were suppose to. We had planned another date and we were talking every night for about 2 weeks and things seemed to be going really good. Fast forward a week and she almost ended things because she wanted to wait till marriage to have sex and was worried by time it became a issue she would be emotionally invested and she did genuinely like me. we decided to take a small break to figure out if I was ok with it and after some time thinking I told her that I was fine with waiting if she wanted.  The next morning after this however she apologized for being wishy washy, but told me she was worried I had gotten too attached too quickly. I had apparently at one point said I was ""emotionally attached"" to her and that terrified her. I do have mild abandonment issues and I think I may have let it slip out during that incident. I am definitely emotionally attracted to her, but attached is definitely not the right word. I tried to explain this, but she had told me her mind was made up and that she was sorry. I ended the conversation saying I wouldn't message her about it anymore because I didn't want to bother her. I noticed she had removed me from everything other than discord which is where we primarily talked. To me that makes me feel like she isn't entirely done with things, but I could be looking into it. I do also have her number and we are still matched on hinge, but we hardly ever used them. I was wondering if I should reach out to her or not after awhile or wait for her to think about things some more and reach out?

"im tired of being told there are women who will love me for who i am because it overwhelmingly feels like there arent my experience with dating has brought me nothing but pain. i dont think its womens fault that they dont find my body appealing, im short, so not many women will initially be attracted to me, and i have a micropenis which unfortunately has been a disappointment to every potential partner. (i am more than willing to use all toys except for sleeves [only toy that makes me feel replaced, i would love it if it didnt make me sad] and give oral to orgasm every time, this does not make my dick any less disappointing in my experience)

it feels like i cant be loved. it feels like love for me has to somehow transcend my body because my body is just that: unloveable. unpreferrable. undesireable. disgusting and disappointing. that hurts in itself but whatever. atleast i can maybe still be loved despite my body? no. every time i talk about this issue im told that there will be women who will love me for me. thats great, where are they?! every woman ive ever tried to court in a romantic sense has been at the very least disappointed by my size, or turned me down immediately due to my height (both are fine things to do, its the fact that that rejection is almost fucking universal) i would love to be THAT GUY for someone. im just not. i just fucking CANNOT compete with other men for anyone.

its really demoralizing. i get somewhat limited attention due to my height, but i try to make the best of it. i dress nicely, i use great cologne, i use makeup to cover the occasional acne or whatever, i pay great attention to my hygiene, i do everything in my power to be the best version of myself. presentable, funny, charismatic, but im still never enough.

im tired of feeling like i cant be a proper sexual being. i cant. nobody wants me sexually. maybe i should try dating asexuals and somehow kill my libido? i dont know. i wish there was a way to just simply not want sex because i want to be at least loved in this lifetime…

She doesn't want emotional attachment with me. She loves me. I know that. I can't deny that. She is loyal. For fuck sake she tbh dosen't have anyone else except me. It's not like she can't make other friends and shit she decided not to. I'm the only person( and another girl bestfriend they're more like sisters) she has. Even though she still says she can't give me what i want. She says she just wants good times and not bad times. She does not prefer having fights and shit and if that happens she can't be there for me. I'll be honest man, as much as i know her. It's not even her fault. She isss like that. She doesn't socialize. Prefers being alone. She has no love for others whatsoever. In terms of male relationships. She doesn't respond well to hard times. Just this week, i was really going through some hard shit. While on call with her i get a but loude. I with no reason scold her. I apologise later but she's like she wants to end it. Note i was so fucked up with some personal family drama i for real cried on call with her. Even after all that during the same call she's like she has decided to end it and it won't change. Note we were in different cities atp. It had been 2 weeks since we met. We talk daily. I immediately came to her the very next day and apologize and boom everything back to normal. When I'm far ahe can't bare it . Far and bad situation?? Breakup for sure and i should come running to convince her. So yaa this is the thing. She was so emotion less during that. I was hurting but ahe didn't care and hurt me more. She doesn't say what's bothering her and expects me to understand everything. She can't settle for less but won't tell me what isss it that she think she deserves and I'm not doing that. For fuck sake I'll work hard to do whatever she deserves bruh. And and she she's is nothing materialistic. All emotional. But in return what i get is her being emotionless. If she's hurting she'll leave. She won't think twice about me. But she loves me. Even i can see that. The efforts she puts to show her love for me .... Uggg i love that man. I love her. But I can't keep letting her hurt me. She says such fucked up things when she's mad.

"Approaching a Campus Crush: Navigating the Unknown So there's this girl on campus I find really cute, my friends don't but I really do. I'm considering approaching her, though I did see her with someone who appeared to be her boyfriend a couple of semesters ago. I haven't noticed them together in a while, so it's possible they broke up. I also observed her being friendly with another guy a month or two ago (like leaning on shoulder and laughing type) I also don’t see them together. 

&amp;#x200B;

My short uni break is over and I'm back and often see her in the cafeteria when she's with her group of friends (the only time i see her pretty much). Im guessing her course is in a different part of the campus, and I think she stays in the dorms. I’m thinking of taking the initiative and using a pick up line (ive got a few shortlisted) and say fuck it and use it even with her friends around (otherwise I’ll never get her alone). Admittedly, I find her attractive, but I don't know anything about her personality or just anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve never dated before but have been approached before. Mostly cause I’ve been preoccupied with the gym and other hobbies/ personal stuff for a while. I've reached a point where I want to explore dating and meet new people.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have concerns about potential rejection, especially since I frequent the same cafeteria and running into her afterward could be awkward. The skewed gender ratio in my comp sci course makes meeting girls hard. While my friends believe I look good and wonder why I'm not dating, I've struggled with self-image issues and tend to be overly critical of myself. Currently, I'm in the process of bulking up, which has slightly impacted my confidence (only slightly since I know the cut is going to be crazy), and I’ve decided not to shave and grow out my facial hair, but its kinda patchy xd.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I’ve been really trying to implement stoicism in my life and follow Mushashi Miyamoto's principles and some other fictional characters. Their wisdom guides me towards a more confident and purposeful approach to life, emphasizing action over excessive contemplation. Despite these influences, I must admit that nervousness still manages to find a way into my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr:Intrigued by a girl on campus, despite friends' differing opinions. Considering her past and recent interactions, I'm contemplating a bold approach at the cafeteria. Eager to explore dating, fear of rejection looms, given frequent encounters. The comp sci course's gender ratio adds complexity. Despite friends' compliments, self-image remains a challenge. Embracing stoicism for confidence, battling persistent nervousness.

"He doesn't do friends but wanted ""benefits"" I am a 20 year old woman in college. I have had only one boyfriend (minus middle school). So I don't have much dating experience. I met this guy at a Taco bell in the drive thru. I told him that he was fine (meaning he was good looking). He gave me my food and said I could take his number. I gave him my IG and I told him I don't give my number. Basically, we started talking. We were chatting about our lives. He was 19. Had a kid (or two?) I told him I was in college and I was going back in 2 weeks. He asked what I wanted out of this, meaning what did I expect from us talking. I told him that I only wanted to be friends. He said that he doesn't do friends. He then told me that his intentions were benefits after he told me that my ""butt looked big"". After revealing his intentions for ""benefits"", I told him that I wasn't in to that. I really didn't mean for anything by telling him he was fine, it was just a compliment. But I need to remember that is not how stuff goes in the adult world.

Over the last 2-3 years ive been getting extremely sad when we go to family events or weddings because im the only one without a +1. All my cousins bring their +1 and all sit together with my aunts and uncles and im just there sitting looking like a freak. I dont even get spoken to unless I say something. It's like ppl value you more if you have someone with you. I dont HATE being single but sometimes I just wish i had someone to spend time with and bring to events you know?

"Is it hurting me that I look young for my age? 37M.

I get carded a lot still. People have to double check my age. Once a stewardess refused to serve me because she didn’t believe my age. Just last night the bouncer at this festival I was at was waving people through. I overheard one of them ask what the minimum age he cards at and he said “I only card if they look younger than 30”. So I go up and sure enough he cards me.

I get a lot of “good for yous!” And stuff like that, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s hurting me with dating online.

If I look young to those people irl, do you think people online are dismissing me outright because they think my pics are old? One person I met was surprised I look exactly like my pics, I’m like… of course I took them last week! Does that mean others are just swiping left thinking I’m lying?

Should I put something about this in my profile?

Sorry if this sounds like a humble brag but I feel like I don’t get taken seriously sometimes based on how I look. I tried a beard and that kind of helps but I can’t really grow it well enough so I think I look better clean shaven.

He was going to come see me. But I gave the idea of me coming to see him (there’s nothing really to do where I’m from) and he lives in a big city.

He asked if he could have 3 or so days to think about it. What does this mean? What factors is he considering? I’m not mad or upset, just curious.

At one moment he even suggested the idea of going to a different state entirely but one close to my hometown. Claimed it was so we could both do something different and see a new place.

The back story on us was… he asked me out to be his girlfriend in high school. That only lasted 12 hours though 🥲. I was curious, bc he broke up with me and we never spoke after that. 6 years later he reaches out for coffee and I'm nosey. Hoping he'd tell me why he did that and why he wanted coffee with me. We meet up and it's extremely awkward, at least for me. We did the coffee date I guess bc he paid for my meal. The date went on for three hours... I didn't feel that connected to him after.*(20f) (22m)* I feel like this is an important detail but he's Lebanese Muslim and I'm a black atheist. Ok moving forward he texts me after the date,” That was fun, let's do it again”! I'm shocked bc I assumed he wasn't attracted to me, and his interest in me was little to none. He didn't call me beautiful, he didn't say anything sweat… it was like an interview. No romance, no hey I like you. Nothing. I felt like he wasn't attracted to me after, so asking for a second date shocked me. We settled on horseback riding bc I remembered he's always wanted to do that. Now he did inform me that he has midterms coming up. I was just shocked that he never texted for two whole weeks. Not a single Hey how are you? Then he texted me about the date… I left him open for 24 hours. As I felt extremely disrespected, he then texted me again. It was cute fun and flirty *finally* so I started responding. This man took 4 hours minimum to respond to his date planning. So I just left him on read and never responded to him again. I completely understand he's in school, he can't cater to me but. I'm I right in cutting him off? I'm extremely attracted to him, from our relationship in high school I know our personalities mesh well together.

"Have you “marked your territory” in a relationship? I once dated a girl that was big into PDA. Holding hands, kissing with others around, that sort of thing. She explained to me that she did it partly because she’s just an outgoing person regarding that sort of thing, but also because it’s sort of like marking her territory. She would wear my hoodies a lot in public to let other guys know she was taken, and she would be very affectionate with me to let other girls know I was taken. 

On a more private level, there is also the “marking your territory” by leaving things at each others places. I had some of her toiletries at my place and some squishmellows on my bed, and I had some toiletries and clothes at her place as well.

I met him 8 months ago with some friends and we spent all the day together. We clicked really well and since then, we talk EVERY day. After one month, we decided to meet up again, and it was perfect. We had such a great time talking.

But during these 10 months, I saw him approximately 6 times. Every time, he was busy seeing his male friends or family and struggled to make plans with me. He told me he was afraid of engagement but was really attracted to me. For him, the beginning was so intense and he never felt that before, so he was afraid and wanted to take it slow. For sure, we spent some quality time, flirting a lot but never going further (no kiss).

He said that he didn't want to hurt me if he was not sure yet. After a while, I decided to step back and let him take a decision, alone. He decided that he wanted to try a relationship and came back to me. But he also told me that he think he can't fulfill my needs and that I deserve someone better or that i could find someone more compatible. I asked him if he changed his mind and wanted to stop but no, he really means it. For me, he's a pure gem. He's amazing. 

He has a traumatic childhood and his past relationship are toxic and he ended up really hurt.

"I’m ready to propose I (22f) met my boyfriend (22m) on Tinder a year and a half ago. I wasn’t expecting to find anyone on a dating app, but it made talking to guys on campus a lot less scary.

I ended up meeting my boyfriend and within a week we were dating. He’s honestly one of the sweetest, kindest, smartest guys ever, and it doesn’t hurt that he’s attractive too. We share similar ideals and as cheesy as it is, he’s my other half. Not to sound like an ad for Tinder, but it still blows my mind how I wouldn’t have met him without the app.

Anyway, we’ve been going strong for a year and a half and I’m ready to propose. I’ve “jokingly” told him I would propose first and he had no issue with it, so that’s what I plan to do. I bought a ring back in February and had it engraved with the one saying he loves to tell me (which I won’t share in case he finds this post, because he’d immediately know). I spent spring break this past semester DIYing a dollar store wooden box with stain and decorative moss to create this nature-ring box to propose to him with. 

We’re both graduating from college this upcoming May, meaning our families will likely be there. The campus garden is beautiful that time of year, and the gazebo is also gorgeous.

"Help Having Dreams About Someone I Thought I Was Over **Edit: I had no idea what Sub to put this in, so yous guys get it!**

I (27F) used to be in love with my high school best friend (27M.) I remember the day I met him when we were teenagers. We got along so well right away. We spent tons of time with friends having a great time. But we also spent a lot of time alone. When we got our licenses the first thing we did was pick each other up. We have sleep overs, went to dances, went to the movies together, and spent tons of time with each other. We enjoyed every moment. I always felt sexual tension with him, and the way we interacted it felt mutual.
 I loved him so deeply, and even expressed it. He loved me too, but not romantically. I accepted that and we continued to have an incredible friendship. Despite his denial nothing really changed. We still had this weird charged energy between us. Idk how to explain what it was. The summer before I left for college was incredible. Fueled by marijuana, night drives, and 7-11 slurpees. But anyway, I left for college.
Throughout college he would visit me, and when I was home. I would visit him. But the distance that college gave us really did seem to make my love dwindle. I actually looked at the way he would treat me, especially when he had a girlfriend. He knew I would always be there but that didn’t quite go both ways. I would have moved mountains for him to love me, and he knew that and used it. So as I got older I got the ick lol And after that we continued to keep in touch and visit at least once or twice a year. I never told him I was over it, but I think it has been apparent through my conversations and interactions. I haven’t felt anything for him romantically or sexually since like 2015. He has definitely (more recently) tried to drunk call me late at night, and sends some weird ass vibes and says things that—other have pointed out to me— are vaguely sexual, like he wants to hook up. I know I’m in a place where, if he offered to hookup, I would decline. Like I don’t need that validation from him at this point in my life. I don’t even think he’s hot anymore. At this point it’s like “aw he’s so cute doing his little *insert niche hobby*. I definitely don’t see him the way I did as a teenager, my god I wanted to rip his clothes off then lol. 

But, recently, I’ve repeatedly had really intense sexual and romantic dreams about him. We’re grinding/making out, he’s sucking on and playing with my nipples/breasts, next I’m sucking him off (which I desperately wanted to do in HS,) having the most rough and intense sex, Im sucking on his fingers, he’s fingering me and I have the most intense orgasm &amp; cuddling after… The list goes on and on. Last night I had a very vivid dream of him entering me, slowly and stretching me out. It was so realistic. I woke up so confused and wet…I’ve dreamed of every type of sex with him possible. I don’t always remember all of it but I am remembering enough to concern me. I have romance based dreams too: going on dates, spending time with each others families, vacationing together, holding hands, neck kisses, massages for both of us, so much cuddling, kissing and touching, him pushing the hair out of my face so he can see me, him giving me back scratches, me straddling him just chatting, smiling , giggling and eventually telling each other “it was always you,” and expressing our regret about not being together sooner.

So what the hell is going on in my head?? Why am I feeling this way NOW? We’re almost 30, and don’t spend any time together anymore. I can’t tell you the last time we saw each other. We do try to see each other and talk on social media. Our schedules never line up though.

"Is it true women look down on men initially, before love sets in? I'm not trying to be sexist, but I've noticed something.  


When a guy first approaches a girl, she may laugh at him with her friends, might give him one word answers, and might be cold. Same for DMs  


When a guy and girl enter the talking stage, she will be more open with him, and nice to him. 

However, there will still be a hint of distrust. She will see him as just another guy when talking about him to her friends  


When they enter a relationship and love develops, then she will not talk bad about him. Rather she will consider him as one of the most special people in her life. She will be as nice to him as she is to her best friend, if not nicer

"Going into the dating scene did me 0 favors. I am left feeling pretty rejected and I feel more isolated more than ever. I have been on dates with plenty of matches but it has really seemed to get passed the first date. What messes with me most is that most to all the dates I've been on has been successful, ending in smiles and even kisses with a few moments of intimacy. But even afterwards, I am yet to see most to all of them again. In my pursuit for affection and appreciation, I feel used and laughed at.

Something I said or did or even the way I looked turn ""I really like you"" to ""I don't want to see you again on a romantic basis, you're just not my type"".

Appreciation and affection has left me with a dry phone and complete isolation. This wasn't what I wanted and it just doesn't make  sense to me. ",AlphaJoah,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ibqj6/going_into_the_dating_scene_did_me_0_favors_i_am/,1691182839.0,0.91
"I [M21] think that I will likely be single forever or at least a very long time. Do you agree? There are many reasons why.

* Guys have to initiate almost everything, at least at the start, especially in regards to asking someone out. I barely like to initiate conversation with my co-workers because I have not much of a reason to talk to them. By nature, I just do not initiate many things, and that's not just with dating, its with many aspects of my life. If I don't need to do something or don't want to do it, I won't do it. That's just how I am. That's a large part of my single-ness.
   * You either put yourself out there, or you don't. Dating is mostly putting yourself out there, which is not something I like doing. I'll do it for a job interview, obviously, as well as other important things, or things I really want, but dating is a different beast. It is something I want, but the process is awful. Think of it this way; I like the result, but not the path to get there, that part I hate. As you can imagine, its difficult for me to make friends. I don't invite people to stuff, go meet people at places, or go to social environments; I just go about my life. Go to work, have fun with my hobbies, eat, and sleep. It takes me months to begin to form a connection with someone I like, I don't call just anyone my friend. I don't know what this categorizes me as, but its how I've been my whole life. I'm a recluse when I want to be, I'm reserved, and I keep to myself. At my job, I'm friendly and nice to people who talk to me, but I don't go out of my way to talk to them unless I need something. I just keep it pushing.
      * Personally, I'm not a believer of the common things people say to people who are in a similar position I am, like ""love will find you when you least expect it"" and ""love will find you."" Because that all sounds like wishful thinking. The world doesn't really work like that. Plenty of people die alone every day, and I might be one of them for the same reasons. This is just my opinion, perfectly okay if you disagree.
   * I know I didn't do a good job showing this in my post; but I do socialize lol, I'm not anti-social or anything, I do enjoy socializing to an extent and I do just fine socializing and being polite, but dating and forming connections with people is my main issue, that is the issue for me. The lack of ability to form connections (or taking a long time to form a connection) I would say is one of my biggest issues. I do not put myself out there because I've been hurt (we all have, I know), and I've gone through some shit that has made me have walls up between me and the world and I don't like letting people in. You can also probably guess that I'm terrible at making good connections lol.
* I **hate** having to read signs. I'm a simple man; I like you, you like me, lets give it a shot. I don't like bullshit like having to read body language, I hate it when people don't tell me shit that I have to find out on my own. I can read basic body language, like being able to tell if someone doesn't want to talk to me, but that doesn't mean I like reading signs women give that say whether she's okay with something or wants you to do something or not, I hate that. Excuse my slight annoyance, this is just a pet peeve that I have that gets to me. I don't like being expected to know how a woman feels or wants based on her body language, it feels like I'm talking to someone who can't actually communicate.
* I don't put myself in uncomfortable, awkward, or anxiety-inducing situations if I can help it. This goes to such an extent that at my work, I don't want to take shit from co-workers about how I'm working so I will remember things they criticize me for just so they will leave me alone and they won't need to criticize me on it and give me shit for it. If I can avoid confrontation, I will. If I can avoid an awkward situation or get out of it somehow, I will. I absolutely hate putting myself in awkward situations.
* I have no career. I have a job right now, so I'm building my finances, but I am not financially stable enough to support another person, a house or even an apartment, everything is far too expensive right now.
* Mental health is shit. I could go on all day about this. That's enough of an issue.

I just do not feel like I'm capable of being in a relationship.

Don't want the post to be too long, even though its already long, so those are the big ones.

This is all just my views and how I feel.

Do you agree or disagree that I'll be single forever? I'm curious what you all think.

"I love my partner but he is smothering me. What can I do? AITA? My boyfriend is the sweetest, most thoughtful kind hearted person I have been with. And I would be empty if we broke up.

I love how he is so affectionate, is open about his emotions, buys me small things to cheer me up, listens, etc.

The problem is he does these things *too* much! Every other day its a gift, every other day I hear speeches or read paragraphs about how much he loves me and how he would do anything for me. Every day I hear how much he misses me multiple times. Every day I hear all of the plans he wants to do.

These things are great in moderation, but I am an introvert and completely consider myself to have dismissive avoidant attachment style. I need my space, which he tries to give me by not texting me too much. But when we do talk he goes overboard to the point I feel uncomfortable and want to pull away. One day he told me he would give up everything for me, which honestly made me feel so freaking uncomfortable.

I love him more when he gives me space. When he isn't so over the top. When he allows room for me to miss him. When he does a small thing like kiss my forehead rather than give me a giant speech on love or stare at me because he is ""admiring me"" (all it does is piss me off).

I want to find a middle ground for us. I want this to work, but it won't work if he keeps smothering me. Has anyone dealt with this and been able to fix it?

"is this going well or not? Hello.

so I have been talking to someone for sometime now and she knows that i'm really into her. some time back she said that she wasn't interested and I said fair enough, which well it was. I've been rejected quite a few times in the past so really its no biggy. that however doesn't stop me liking her.

the conversations will be things like her saying how I keep making time to speak to her must mean that I really like her and me responding with things like '\*jokingly ""I felt sorry for you as no one here likes you"" (and I can't express how much of a joke that is and she is aware of it.) as well as things like ""aah, but you haven't told me to go away so you can't dislike me that much"" and getting a huge smile from it.

I'm considering asking her out for the 2nd time as it seems to me like its sorta flirting from both sides not just from what she says but what she does, reacts etc. and even other people have said its hard to tell.

"lots of a lot of a lot. Pack a lunch Forgive my ignorance as i am not so hip with the kids and am quite unfamiliar with the etiquette and whatever of internets

I (40M) have not been intimate with a woman for many years (i don't even want to figure it out because it'd be far too depressing).i know that a number is just a number and it's not that important to me, but finding someone that i might have a chance to start a family with is my top priority.

I have been taking care of my elderly mother for about ten years, she has severe bipolar issues and it's definitely an unhealthy relationship but I couldn't just abandon her. Anyway, things have gotten to a point where I have had to find assisted living now for her and she is accepting of that. This feels like the very first time in a very long time where I will actually be able to live MY life and honestly, it's scary. For the past couple years I've worked hard to get her house ready to put on the market and we're about to have it listed. Okay I'm rambling a bit now so im gonna try to reel it in.

It seems like its so hard to meet people at this age. Having children has always been extremely important to me and I'm terrified that it's too late now. It would be ideal to find someone who wants a 'stay-at-home-husband' but that seems like it's unrealistic for me to expect. I've been told that I'm good looking, people are always surprised to learn my age, and I am great with kids, as i myself am a child in many ways. I am lacking a lot of adult skills necessary for living independently and am not sure what or how to do what i want or need to to even have a chance to make this dream a reality. I have so much love in my heart to give and the idea of not having a family of my own to share a  life with is so depressing that when I think about it, my conclusion is generally ""well, then I suppose I'll have to decide on the optimal means of ending my own life at that point."" Which obv scares me and is hardly productive, seems more like a cop out more than anything.

The last woman I had a relations with ended up commiting suicide, we were casual, only a handful of casuals. But she reached out for help the night of, and it really fucked me up. I spent about 4-5 years identifying as an 'asexual'. I was, and still am, attracted to women, I would, and do, masturbate  when the need would arise. But it mostly felt like a chore, just a way of getting rid of an erection or to quell the urges, etc. When I have tried to spark some casual or otherwise relations, I feel like I just creep them out. I don't know how to engage properly. I have trouble filtering thoughts/speech and if I'm saying something it's almost always just a direct representation of thoughts. I like to think of it as pure honesty, or authenticity, but I have lost friends, impacted relationships both professional and social with my inability to suppress impulse or to be more reserved in what I say. As evidenced by the length of this post.

DAMMIT

uhhhh, I know I'm throwing a lot out there and will be surprised if anyone reads this far. But I'll continue as if nobody is watching, cuz they are aren't! So it'll be easy. 🙂

I have recently been in touch with an ex from like, wayyyy back. I enjoy our talks, think she is very interesting and attractive (at least she was, it's been quite some time) and she has shown signs that she wants more, but I have some reasonable concerns. She is out of state and moving here (coincidentally) ,she recently asked if I would move in to a place with her but that is..... That is a lot of a lot. Another concern is that she is a mother of a very special needs child. I would love and leap at the chance normally, but it is nonverbal autistic and that is something that I would not know how to handle. I'm not proud of that but there it is.

I don't know if i should just tell her I can't do that or what direction to take things.

I have always wanted to have children, it's extremely important to me but whether they come from deez nutz or doze nutz makes little difference to me.

Little difference, but some difference.

Hey, like I said, I know that was a lot and have zero expectations for what attention or interest may result but I would please just like to say thank you for anything or even nothing because it helps just to get this out there and help me to understand myself a little better.

Any and all suggestions, insights, condemnations, accusations, blah blah blah will be appreciated

Thank you for your time

"Is it necessary (27f) to disclose a legal name change to a partner? I got bullied a lot for my first and last name growing up. As a result, since I was 12, I have gone by a nickname instead and a different last name that has some history behind it. It's a name I am used to being called/identify with..even though it's completely different from my previous legal name (which I don't even feel remotely connected to). I also have a lot of trauma with my upbringing and so for me, my old name just isn't something that I feel identifies me. I actually feel like myself when people call me by the name I chose for myself.  
  
My old legal name was something like : Anne Walker  
  
I changed it to: Anna Elizabeth Marie Coleman-Walker  
  
So essentially I kept my legal last name but hyphenated it, and changed the last letter in my first name. I always went by 'Elizabeth Coleman' instead and it just stuck so I added that onto my new name (people at school used to always call me elizabeth because they mistook me for a girl that name and it just stuck...and then I chose the last name because of someone i greatly admire).  
  
My sister thinks I should disclose this name change to my partner simply because it was my previous legal name for so long, but I don't find it necessary? for example, I don't even feel the need to tell my absolute best friend in the world that I changed my name because to me...it isn't important? I know my best friend wouldn't judge, but it just feels insignificant to share and tbh, I also am a bit embarrassed to share my old name anyway? but I feel like a dishonest person for not revealing everything about my past to my current partner? Does anyone have any insight?

"How do I even tell if the date went well? I'm very new to online dating and it's getting super confusing for me. 

I met this guy on an impromptu first date and it went well. Only red flag being he had a recent breakup. Then 2 days of silence. I liked him so I casually initiated the second date which he accepted enthusiastically. It ended up at his place with us watching a movie and me sleeping over. We talked a lot of deep stuff, he even cried at a point, we made out and cuddled the whole time, he also talked about different things we should try out next. He also mentioned he suffers from anxiety. When i was leaving he pulled me back for a kiss. All good. I thought this time around i should give him the chance to message first to gauge his interest. Radio silence for a week. At this point I knew it was a bad sign but I thought maybe it's his anxiety and I should give it a last try. So I texted asking how his weeks been and that I missed his dog. He replied immediately and also asked how I've been... but that's it. I believe this was a good enough chance for him to initiate something if he was remotely interested. I'm confused where it went wrong! At this point I can't even tell if a date's going well or not. Like there was not even an iota of unsurity in his mind... if there was he'd be flakey or slow fade eventually.

"Girl gonna win my heart or break it into pieces..(M18) Okay so this is going to be a long story.  I met a girl via a friend in a party and then she initiated convos and had a great time vibed together and one thing led to another and we ended up kissing each other. ( She was my first kiss) i then asked her out for date and she didn't hesitate and we went on dates multiple actually. She (F20) also stayed over at my place in the nights and we had great times together. But for the past few months we've been on and off and not met in 3 months. ( She went to meet her  family ) I always initiate texts and don't really have to carry the conversation but I feel a little sad that she never initiates texts. And she recently came back to City and tells that she is busy with college works. I took the bullet and asked if things were alright between us and she says she'll discuss it with me in person. I'm not sure what does this mean and everything is new to me this situationship and stuff am i just overthinking or delusional I'm not sure but any sort of support will be helpful.

"What to do if both awkward and shy… I like this guy. We worked together for about a month. I think he’s interesting and want to know more about him. I often catch him looking at me or my friends tell me that he’s looking at me. I’ve also noticed that when I say something slightly funny he smiles off by the side never laughing out loud just a quiet smile or “giggle” as my friends called it. 

There have been moments when I’ll try and steal a glance at him only to find that he’s already looking. Or I’ll be talking to someone else and I can feel him looking at me. Or we look at each other at the same time. Or we’re walking past each other and I look at him so he does a half smile and it’s a really awkward one like he’s not sure that he’s suppose to be doing it.

I treat him about the same way I do my other coworkers I say hi when I see him and if he makes eye contact I’ll smile or wave. The difference is the rest of them are extroverts and will spark up a conversation with me or come over randomly for a chat. With him though he just kind of 🧍🏻

Also I feel like there are a lot of moments when he might want to say something to me but isn’t sure what or how to say whatever it is. I can’t tell if he’s just shy and wants to talk or if he’s just a stary guy or if he might even hate me.

I’m not sure what I’m asking. I guess it’s along the lines of “what do I do?”

"girl rejects me then messages me a week later to ask how I am doing Hey Everyone

While attending school I met a really kind girl, she was extremely nice to me she would help me on assignments after and before class she treated me so kindly and was always enthusiastic. I however got her number near the end of class and it's been a month since the course had ended I've had the desire to meet with her again just to come together, for she was superbly nice to me. Though she isn't necessarily my type in terms of looks nevertheless she had such a fantastic impression on me that i have been unable to forget about her so I recently texted her and after a bit of back and forth I messaged her something along the lines of.

Me: When can I see you again ? because you are a very kind person who I want to get to know better.

Her: Thats nice of you thanks so much

Her:Im so busy with studying and after that I will be going on a trip.

I texted her that it's not a problem, that she enjoy her trip and to take care.she replied with thank you and that I enjoy my summer as well

  
Thereafter I decided it would be best if I stop talking to her to not look desperate and also so I could get my emotions in check. Then approximately a week later after getting rejected she messages me and ask how I am doing, how my dog is doing then also asked what classes I will be taking the coming semester, and I as well ask her what classes she will be taking. This comes as a surprise to me because she's never asked me any one of those questions before. I then tell her that that I wish her the best of luck in her upcoming classes and that she take care she tells me something similar and adds a love emoji 🥰 at the end of her message which stuck out to me. This all occurred within a short amount of time as usually a response from her takes typically 30 minutes to 1 hour for one response lol and is rarely an immediate response as it was this time. What should I make of this situation as this conversation occurred a week ago and I am unsure if she is attempting to signal to me that she's interested, I as well kinda want to move on now and don't want to get my emotions hurt again or do anything to make this situation awkward. I forgot to add that when she messaged me she also informed me that she had applied for a student position at the school we attend which I recommended she apply for since she is particularly great at math, perhaps thats the only reason why she messaged me last week .",MrTOM_Cant901,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ioouf/girl_rejects_me_then_messages_me_a_week_later_to/,1691219229.0,0.99
"I feel like online dating just doesn’t work for me based on how I express emotion and I’m curious whether anyone else feels the same. Should I clarify that I take time to build up feelings for someone? Believe it or not, I’ve actually had good experiences with online dating and gone on some very fun dates (and definitely realize a lot of others aren’t so lucky). I guess what really stops me in my tracks though is meeting someone on an app, meeting them irl, then not expressing enough interest in person which I think might be turning them off. I have friends who are not hesitant to make out on the first date, but that is extremely not me. I think the only time I could ever think about something like that is when I’m drunk or high. But maybe it’s normal to show loads of interest early? Other relationships throughout my life have taken time to develop.

"I asked my boyfriend what he wanted for his birthday and when I told my grandma (who is normally very cruel to everyone) she said “that’s stupid and it ruins the surprise” is this true? So for context. I (f17) never know what to get my boyfriend (m17) for a gift whether that be Christmas his birthday or any other gift giving time. But this year I’ve been completely stumped so I asked him “hey, can you make a list of stuff you want for your birthday and I can pick a couple out and they can be your gifts.” My reasoning was that so I know he likes them plus I have stuff for next year or Christmas. When telling my family, my grandma overheard this and felt the need to say something about it. She told me that it was a “stupid idea” that I asked him what he wanted and “it ruins the surprise.” When telling her that he doesn’t actually know which gifts he’ll get because he sent me 7 or 8 ideas I picked 3 and I didn’t tell him which they were. I was met with a snarky scoff and a “whatever, do what you want, I just think it ruins the surprise.” By my grandma.

"I 23F want to leave my 1+ year situationship with 26M but he’s starting to change I 23F started talking to this guy 26M a little over a year ago. In the beginning we were having fun and getting to know each other, we weren’t in a relationship as we both decided we didn’t want to dive in the deep end just yet as I left a relationship a month prior. Eventually we started having sex and talking more often. We’d go out with friends and they’ll know that we “go together” but he never asked me to be his gf. After a while I realized that he’d want the “boyfriend treatment” but never made it clear what I was to him. He’d want to make rules for me to follow and but I never gave him any rules….

Anyway our “relationship” in a nutshell for the past year and 3 months have been going on with friends (ps. we’ve never been out together alone…not even 1 casual movie date), having sex at night most times midnight, texting/calling and gift exchange for special days. We’ve never said I love you to each other, we’ve never spent the full night together even when I got my own apartment. 

I brought this up to him before but he never answered me when I said idk what I am to him and he never asked me to be his gf….he deflected it with a question and then said that he cares for me very much and he’s sad that I feel this way. This way being I’m only here for sex. 

Som information: he works out of town during the week and he’s only in town on the weekends so that’s the only time I get to see him. His excuse for us not going out together is that he’s tired and he only has a limited time with me so he doesn’t wants to use it for the things that matter which is talking in bed, having sex then he either leaves or drops me home. My thing is…he finds time and the strength to go out to parties on the weekends but he can’t find the energy to go out with me? Crazy.. 

I brought up everything I was feeling, I also brought up an incident that happened between us that I didn’t like and he some how made him self the victim by bring up an experience in the past and how me talking about that incident reminded him of that dark time and he doesn’t like that. 
He realized that some of my points were valid but I wasn’t being fair for some of the others bcz of his work situation. 

After that he started calling me more often and being a bit over bearing like he was trying to over compensate for something and it was annoying the hell out of me. We spoke about his sudden rise in interest for me and he said..that now he feels like he did this for nothing bcz I complained about something and now that he’s trying to do what I want I’m drawing back… 

I’ve been slowly losing my interest in him and I just feel like we’ve been at the same place since last year…there are not progressions and he doesn’t make it seem like there are any genuine plans for our future together. 

Idk what to do now because I don’t feel the same attraction to him as I did before and everything he does annoys me for some reason. Now he’s trying to make plans for us to go out and do things together but I think it’s too late. Part of my wants to see if I can some how get my feelings back to where they were but another part fears that I’m gonna waste his time bcz my feelings are already completely gone.

"I discovered something that completely changed the way I view him, and wow did I need it! So some context; throughout our relationship my ex (M21) would send me (F21) posts from an account called The Mask on IG. One of those “posts on Twitter, screenshots, posts on IG”. The posts he would send me were lighthearted, funny, relationship posts. He sent them to me consistently throughout the relationship to the point that the account started showing up on my own FYP. So it was no surprise that one of their posts showed up, months after the breakup. Tapping on it, I was met with a post that read “vent to me… so I can learn how to manipulate you properly.” The breakup was mutual so there was no blocking of socials (tho there has been NC) and guess who liked the post! That’s right!! My ex!! He is the only person out of my entire follower list who follows this account, so it was extremely easy to see the posts he liked. 

Cue a very cathartic deep dive into what this account actually posts. Which are mainly extremely misogynistic, sexist, encouraging infidelity, and those lighthearted posts my ex would send me. And seeing the posts my ex liked (all during our relationship) was appalling. He had liked so many of these disgusting posts, including a lot of ones about cheating. This boy looked me in the eye and said verbatim “I think cheating is disgusting, inexcusable, and an abominable act, I don’t condone it,” and then he goes and likes these disgusting posts? It’s one thing to see a post, chuckle, and move on but to actively go out of your way to like it?? Sorry not sorry, you don’t actively like posts speaking about infidelity and manipulation like that unless you believe in it too. 

About halfway through the relationship he admitted to me he went on an “accidental date” with a sorority girl he met at a mixer during his pledgeship to join a fraternity. They had lunch together and apparently it wasn’t until after the date that he realized what he did, apologized to the girl, and deleted her contact details. BUT he didn’t tell me until TWO WEEKS after the fact. My ex is a good looking guy and I knew girls were more than likely flirting with him at mixers like that. And I fully trusted him to handle himself. But for him to say “oh it’s funny to see them try, it’s so obvious, I got the best girl already, I’d never cheat,” and then he GOES ON A LITERAL DATE with a girl while we were in a committed relationship? She had to have given you her number (or you asked for hers), text back and forth, set up the date, go on said date, and not ONCE was there an opportunity for you to say “oh btw I have a gf,” or realize what was going on?? It very well could’ve been a friendly encounter, but he admitted that he didn’t tell her he had a gf until he texted apologizing, and that she agreed and thought it was a date.

Having seen these posts that he liked and connecting the dots, it’s been such a mental slap in the face. But my GOD did I need it. The way I lost a majority of my feelings and love for him with just a few posts alone showed he never deserved me and I deserve someone way better than him. I’m not gonna go out of my way and say he cheated on me and that’s why we broke up (even if nothing physical happened it was definitely emotional cheating). But I will rest well at night knowing I dodged a huge bullet and no longer being with someone who I now find disgusting. Im honestly more angry at myself for not breaking up with him when he told me about this “accidental date.” I promised myself before ever getting into a relationship that if cheating happened I would leave no questions asks. Love does make you blind, but I’m thankful this has opened my eyes to my own worthiness and respect I know I deserve.",Constantly_Emotional,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15i9kok/i_discovered_something_that_completely_changed/,1691177878.0,0.81
"Perspective needed. I (26F) is currently single. I was head over heals with a guy Jack. This guy checked all my boxes, basically the kind of guy I ever wanted. I was in absolutely in love with him as soon I met him (2 years ago). But unfortunately he didn’t feel the same way about me. We used to talk here and there but it was hurting me like hell so we stopped talking. He knew how I feel about him. I have never dated anyone since because i just didn’t feel to give that space in my life to someone else other than him.
Lately I met someone (chris) we have been talking and it is getting serious. I know I like this guy a lot, he makes me laugh (this maybe something usual for the rest of the world but I don’t really remember when was the last time that happened with me). I am all smiles around him. It feels really very peaceful when I am with him. He is very kind, caring, ticks all my boxes. Basically a kind of guy I would want to marry. And to my fortunate we share mutual feelings about each other and really wants us to give a chance and wanting to move forward.

But I sometimes I feel so unsure about chris since what happened jack. I mean up until now i never wanted to give that space of jack to someone and now i came across someone who is so perfect and most importantly makes me happy but still jack is always in the back of my mind. It feels like i am unnecessarily obsessing on my past I should let it go because nothing is ever going to happen with me and jack since we don’t share mutual feelings. But something inside me doesn’t let me forget about jack. Even if his picture comes up my face lights up. 
But I don’t want to obsess on my past and want to open my doors for present and future with chris.

"Confused about a situation that I felt like I may have fumbled, but then didn’t? I went to a karaoke bar last night, sang a song and a girl joined me, she was super cool, so I got her number, offered to buy her a drink and we started talking. We vibed really well and I could tell she was into me. I met some of her friends, and they also seemed cool. 

We kissed couple times, sang another song, and were having a good time. I’m not a person who looks for one night stands first and foremost, and I genuinely was interested in getting to know her, but whatever came out of it, I was okay with. She even pointed it out, how she was really enjoying me because I was different, I quote “I didn’t want to get in her pants, rather was interested in her and getting to know her, and she found it sweet and genuine.” 

Her friends were about to leave, and my friends too. I had work today at 7 AM and it was like 12:30 AM. She said she had to go with her friends , and I asked will I see her again and can I take her out. She said I can and that I have her number. I texted her shortly after and she responded “it was so nice meeting you tonight”. I replied with “likewise! Im so glad you decided to come sing with me”, around 1 AM. and after was gonna lead onto picking back our conversation over some drinks, and me taking her out. 

I haven’t gotten a response yet. Idk why I feel like I should’ve pursued her more, or maybe she wanted me to take her home? But she said otherwise herself and that’s why I didn’t push for it.

"Dating advice So, I've been to a date with this girl which I keep liking more everyday and we really seem to vibe, especially thro text. The date went great and we've had a really good time together even tho I did feel some ""dead"" moments when I wasn't sure what to bring up in order to keep the convo going(keep in mind I'm naturally shy and reserved). Although she seemed out of my league we seem to be on the same page in regards to what we'd maybe want there to be between the 2 of us, just taking things slow and enjoying the time together in the meantime. My main issue is, how does dating actually work nowadays? Am I supposed to make a move next time we're gonna be together or what? 

For context:
We chat for hours everyday.
She's made time for me to organise our next date, cancelling some previous plans she had.

"Why hasn’t he texted? SUPER long story short. I had a mutual attraction with this guy and we both didn’t know that we were attracted to eachother. (Side note, his older girl cousin has been rooting for us to get together since we met). He’s a really confident guy and a great speaker, but he was scared to approach me and talk to me this entire time. By the time I found out that info, he had a girlfriend. Anyways I just recently found out they broke up in early February after only about 2 month of dating. Keep in mind he has NO socials so he doesn’t follow me on anything. So I posted something on my Instagram story that had to do with being single, and his cousin responded asking if I was single (LOL) and ended up asking if she can set up a boba hang out between us. I agreed and gave her my number to give to him and I literally had a physical reaction that night. I threw up, was sweating so much and was so nauseated the whole day that I had to miss work the next day. I know Im jmust an anxious gurly haha. Anyways we have been texting and he’s pretty dry, but he was on vacation so I let it slide. We finally met up and I was so nervous at first but as soon as I saw him my nerves eased up. The convo was flowing SO well and we had sooooo much in common. We talked for 2 hours and I am assuming it was a “date” because he paid for my drink and we were talking about deep stuff such as religions and heartbreaks. Anyways, date ended, we hugged, and he’s super into the gym so he even mentioned going together some day. A few hours after our date, he texted saying he had a great time and even invited me to church with him. I didn’t go because my cousin already invited me to her church and she was here from out of town. So I let him know that but also told him I had a great time too and we should hang again soon! He always replied pretty slow, but he took 1 day and a half to love the message and he responded with something along the lines of “for sure, I have some interviews and church events but I’ll let you know if some time comes up”. The text kind of upset me but I get that he’s just a bad texted and being honest. The sad part is that that was Monday and it’s Friday now but I have no text :(. Am I over reacting or do you think he will reach out?


Side note: I feel like the feeling was mutual and we both had a good time, or why else would he text me saying that? He didn’t have to text if he didn’t have a good time and also he didn’t have to invite me to his church. Everyone is telling me to cut it off if he doesn’t reply in the next few days but I really feel like this is something amazing. I can picture myself marrying him(I know that’s crazy) and I’ve never felt that way about a guy. He’s the most attractive and driven guy I’ve ever dated and he’s so vulnerable and not ashamed. And honestly when we first met, I felt like it was live at first sight I can’t lie. I know I sound insane. So now us talking just elevated my feelings.

"Moving for a better dating scene? Gay guy here and I am just curious on some thoughts around moving for a better chance at finding a partner and settling down. I live in a smaller city in the south (about 500,000 people in the metro area). I’m from here originally and moved back after college. My job is good, I have family and friends here as well and it’s all very familiar. 

However, as I am getting older I am starting to want to settle down. I’m 30 currently and about to be 31 in a few months. I’ve been thinking about making a move to a bigger city in the south specifically Atlanta as I am most familiar with it from visiting often in college. I have a few contacts/old friends I’ve lost touch with but it wouldn’t be difficult to reach out so it’s not like I would be moving to somewhere random without knowing anyone but it certainly would be a very new experience. I’ve only ever lived in my college town and hometown (current city). 

Obviously moving solely for the chance at meeting a partner wouldn’t be the best idea but I would be lying if that it’s a large majority of the reason for me to move. My current city has a small gay community and I’ve met some new friends in the last year but no one I’ve been interested in. Last year I went on around 18 dates in the area but just never found anyone I liked/was attracted to. I’ve pretty much exhausted the online dating scene and when I go out to the 3 gay bars here I usually just see the same faces from online or couples. No one I’ve been actively interested in enough to strike up a conversation. For reference I’ve been in two long term relationships in college and after both 4 years each. Been single now for the last year and a half. I suppose I just psych myself out/am scared to move for fear of being more lonely than I already am. Most of my friends are getting married or are having kids and it kinda just feels like I am getting left behind (granted most are straight but the few gay friends I have are coupled up as well).

"Asked for space for one day. Was it too much to ask? So I've been dating this girl for 2 months. We are around an hour from each other and because I we mutaully decided for me not to meet her kids for a while, we only see each other a few times a month and some occasional dates thrown in. So we talk a lot and text. A lot. All day, every day. She knows I'm not a huge phone person. We've had long conversations about it. 

So sometimes, and I also made this clear, I like to unplug from the phone. Like once or twice a month, max. The last time I did it she made a huge deal about it, thought I was seeing other people, bla bla bla. So we had a long conversation about it, hours of talking and texting, and came to an understanding. I thought. From this convo I told her instead of just not replying I would let her know I was taking a break from the phone. To have clear communication as they say. 

So I did yesterday. After about 20 texts and a lot of confusion she seemed to understand what I was doing. I told her I'd catch up with her today. Well first thing this morning the texts start. Asking 20 questions about why I did it, was it because of her, why don't I do this, why don't I do that, on and on. I asked her if she forgot that I told her I would catch up with her today, implying just give me some space. I was planning on contacting her around lunch. She replied that I was basically being selfish and I can't decide  when she texts. Since I only asked this boundary once or twice a month, do you think I'm overreacting for telling her I'm done with her?

It sucks because the time we do spend together is awesome, and I feel if we saw each other in person more it wouldn't be a problem. She is a quality person but just can't wrap her mind around the fact I need some space once in a while. Advice would be appreciated.

"""Insecure"" has become a very ironic and sad insult. Insecurity with self-awareness and understanding is negativity directed inwards. It doesn't lead to bitterness or resentment. In a way it's a form of sadness. On the other hand, insecurity without self-awareness can lead to people lashing out and blaming others, it's all externalized while the person considers themselves blameless.

These days it feels like it's almost always used to refer to the latter. It's used to refer to someone pathetic and deplorable, rather than someone saddened by some aspect of themselves.

I don't think that most insecure people are the self-inflating pushy douchbags that people associate with insecurity, which makes it all the more sad to me when I see it tossed around as an insult. It's just a very bizarre thing to have a trait which manifests in such opposite ways.",Kelburno,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ijix5/insecure_has_become_a_very_ironic_and_sad_insult/,1691202669.0,0.5

"Should I just END it? I'm 20 currently in college and my girlfriend 19 goes to the same college as me. We've dated for a year

When we first met, I just thought it was an easy hookup, I was partying and going out a lot

Then I started to lose friends and ran out of $$$. So I ""fell"" for her. Dont get me wrong she's nice, looks good, I enjoy spending time with her. We never really have BIG arguments.

Tbh she treated me better than anyone in my life

But, my issue is, I like sex a lot not just with her, but with other women as-well. When we first met she was okay with it and I promised not to get emotionally attached to the girls I hooked up with. 

I never did get emotional with them, but she couldnt take it, which I understand. 

So I tried being monogamous for a while - 1 or 2 months, being broke and lonely made it easier, but at some point, I couldn't take it. I would cheat behind her back.

She'd find out and I apologized and she forgave me and we tried again but I lasted a few weeks

I cheated on her birthday month. fuck I sound terrible. but she never knew about it. 

At the beginning of the summer, we decided to take classes together for the fall semester half of our classes are together. We chose the best professors and time to take classes. 

Then a few weeks pass by, she couldn't handle knowing I'm always looking at other girls or etc.. again I understand.

So we tried doing an open relationship, at first, it was fine but I just couldn't take seeing her text other men and she herself was disgusted by it after talking to a few guys on day 4

So now wtf do I do, if I break up with her we have the same classes, the same school,  and I know nobody except her. But, also do enjoy her company. But is that real ""love""? Am I not just dependent on her because I'm lonely and don't have the things I want in life yet?

I also feel like I'd never get a girl like her again. fuck I'm so young

I feel like there's someone who's hotter, more fun, and better out there. But, the fear of the unknown or making the wrong decision frightens me. 

I know even asking this here shows I shouldn't waste her time finding true Love

"Don’t let a lack of sexual chemistry ruin your relationship Lust is very powerful, especially when you haven’t been pleased much in the bed. In past relationships where my partner wasn’t the best in bed I found myself often opening up to men outside of my relationship, seeking to find in them what I wasn’t finding in my partner. 

It was all sexual, nothing more I wanted from them than that. I never cheated physically, because I guess you could call what I was doing emotional cheating, because while I would let other men text and call me I could never bring myself to actually have sex with them. I just didn’t have it in my heart. I didn’t fall in love with the men in my past relationships, but I had respect for them to at least not allow another man to touch on me. And even though it was all pure verbal communication, it still was not okay. 

It took me time to realize that a man is not just going to know how to work my body. It took me time to understand sex is more than just getting naked and hopping in the bed with someone and magic just happening, it’s learning their body and their mind. This was not obvious to me, I didn’t understand sex at all at first. 

So if the sex is shitty, look at yourself first. Are you communicating? Are you telling them what you want? No games, no riddles, no “you should know what I desire” nope nope nope, being in a relationship you are learning your partner and they are learning you. It’s pretty unfair to bash someone on their sex game when they simply don’t understand how to get you there. Direct them, guide them, be patient. 

And if after you learn each other’s bodies and the sex still sucks, well shit ion know what to tell you😂

"OLD strategy ethics I'm a age 38 male, slightly overweight and 6' 2"". I have a full head of hair and probably could pass for early 30s.

So I got a Match and a POF subscription. I'm relatively attractive and was told I looked like Heath Ledger by several very attractive woman when I was in my twenties. I was too lazy to make decent profile pictures and I got a few responses from girls that I consider attractive enough. The replies usually dropped off after a couple of exchanges. I stopped really messing with it after getting zero responses for a few months. I decided to try a different strategy and get some decent profile pictures. I thought about hiring a professional photographer, but don't want to spend too much time and money. So I thought about what AI can do and found a decent app and found some excellent pictures to superimpose my face to. I'm not using a picture of someone who is entirely different than my physique. They just have nice hair, clothes and a good background etc. I also decided to pepper actual photos of myself in the profile so I'm not entirely misrepresenting myself. The results were immediate and I've gotten more matches in a couple of days than I had in over 6 months. Now I'm realizing how impossible it would have been to get a date without having decent pictures. Even now I don't get as an immediate response as I'd prefer once we match. I know that I'm in a very ethnically questionable situation. I'm just curious about what people think about my situation. I'm also realizing how many guys these girls must be engaging with simultaneously and even with the edge of my profile pictures I still have to really put in the effort with messaging. My primary question is whether or not to write to long and detailed messages or to keep them short and sweet. I actually have a date with one girl and I had barely messaged with. There's some others that I really tried to make a serious effort to get to know and they have been taking longer to respond. How quickly should I try to engage in a physical date?

"Struggling with Bitterness After Breakup, Seeking Thoughts and Ideas Hello, Reddit community! I'm a 24-year-old male, currently a college student with an excellent career (though hard to quantify). Last year, I earned more money than my parents and grandparents combined. I consider myself a hardworking person, but like everyone, I have my weak points, such as being quite sensitive. I am of Czech nationality.  
  
\-------------------------------  
  
Before diving into my situation, I want to clarify that everything I'm about to share is based on my personal experiences. While I'm aware of communities like ""red-pill,"" I don't subscribe to them, and my knowledge of such communities is limited.  
  
I've been fortunate in finding women to connect with, but I've struggled with breakups. Most of my relationships lasted around a year, and I've had five partners along with two instances of dating. However, my most recent breakup, which occurred about a month ago with a girl I knew for a long time, had a different impact on me. I noticed a shift in my thought patterns, as I now find myself feeling bitter towards all women due to the pain I experienced. This bitterness became even more apparent when I recently met my ex to return some belongings, and she arrived with her new date/relationship, which hurt me deeply. Maybe it was intentional, but I do not want to judge that.  
  
As I wanted to explore my feelings, I wrote my experiences on a piece of paper: I was cheated on twice and betrayed two other times (I don't remember if exclusivity was discussed with those). Additionally, four partners moved on in less than two weeks after our breakups. About two of them were basically my replacements, which started brewing right at the end of the relationship.  
  
I admit that I wasn't always the best boyfriend, but I was consistently respectful and tried to be kind. Like everyone, I made a lot of mistakes. At first, I blamed myself when I started feeling bitter, as I was the only common factor in those relationships. However, I can't help but wonder if I'm truly that bad of a person, that I somehow deserved this. I want to emphasize that I never cheated on my partners and always tried to be open, though sometimes I didn't have much time, I always found some time to spend with them.  
  
What is my rationale behind the bitterness towards women?  
  
As I've tried to analyze my feelings, I noticed a pattern and began considering the cultural context. My country is heavily westernized, especially among my peers. This means we have adopted phenomena like democratization of the dating pool through online dating, which has created numerous options for women. However, it seems to have had a negative impact on men, leading to issues like depression, loneliness, and even ""incels."" The vast array of potential partners might be affecting girl's willingness to commit and be faithful.  
  
I want to clarify that I understand I could be wrong, or perhaps I'm exaggerating the impact of these cultural factors. But I find solace in sharing my feelings and thoughts here.  
  
With that said, I'd appreciate any thoughts or ideas you might have on this matter, beyond the typical advice of ""just don't be bitter, it's not healthy."" I intend to learn from my recent breakup and grow as a person, but I'm still struggling to understand my own feeling here.

"I approached a stranger and let him know he was cute, but… Hey guys, I’m a 23 year old woman in NYC. I don’t have dating apps because apparently people are saying it’s way better to approach someone in public and guys say they feel flattered if they were approached in public, so I tried it lol. I saw a cute guy on the street with his friends and I thought I would muster up my confidence and let him know he was cute. I’m very shy and introverted, so it took me a long while to decide whether I should do it or not. He was also with a group of friends like 4-5 people. I decided to do it and I said I thought he was cute and he said thanks, but he has a girlfriend. I said I respect it and I walked away. We walked in the same direction so I heard him say, “we’re walking in the same direction, this is so awkward” and I just brushed it off and kept walking faster. Lol it kinda threw me off but whatever 😭

I haven’t had any luck in dating someone, so I tried this and I don’t know if I should go to the dating apps…

Edit: Damn, I was just talking into the void and didn’t expect this to blow up, but please stop sending me dms looking to meet me lmfao. I am NOT gonna link up with you. Also, I’m aware this is how “men feel in the dating world” but quit invalidating how I feel because I (and other women) get rejected just as much as you guys do.

"""Proper"" first date? So I (23M) have been on quite a few first dates. (For reference I'm currently dating to find a serious relationship). When I was 18 and hopped on tinder I did a lot of first dates at restaurants, but honestly I really didn't enjoy those and never had much luck landed 2nd dates. For me, the stress of a public resturant environment mixed with the stress of trying to make conversation with a completely stranger never really led to much flirtation or romantic connection. 

My fix for this was I'd invite girls round to my house to cook for them. This was much better and almost every date went well, it's a much more relaxed and quiet environment where it's easier to break the touch barrier, do fun activities and just have more banter and things to talk about, also getting to cook for someone is nice. 

The problem is, I read a lot of girls just assume going to someone's house for the first date = hookup. And I myself have experienced a few girls coming round who had very little interest in me beyond what was in my trousers. 

I want to attract the kind of woman that isn't just down for a quick hookup, but personally I hate going to restaurants/formally sitting across a table with a girl for the first date. I've considered mini golf or something but I'd prefer something slightly less teenagery feeling to it if that makes sense. 

So yeah, this was rambly but any ideas on where I can take a girl for the first date that is a more relaxed environment without it being trashy/corny?",Secret-Football564,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ihf13/proper_first_date/,1691196761.0,1.0
"My boyfriend acts weird with his phone recently So pretty recently my boyfriend found out that I went through his phone a few times and he decided to change his phone password. I found out previously he had bought fansly from other women in his last relationship (his only other relationship and they never got along/were not attracted to each other they had been dating since middle school and decided to thug jt out since it had been so long. they broke up like almost a year ago, his doing) and not only that but he had twitter accounts that were following NSFW etc etc. I have strong boundaries with porn and things of that nature due to past relationships. He respects that and says he no longer watches porn and i believe him. But i also found out that he made a separate instagram in May and tried to login to an old  twitter pretty recently. (this was before he changed his password). So i can't help but get scared that he's being weird online. I asked if he would ever make alternate accounts on social media and he said no. So we had a talk and obviously i love him and i wouldn't lie and i admitted yeah i looked a little into ur phone and he was pretty chill and he said he didn't like it but was used to it cuz his ex did that as well. but then he changed it and i asked and he said because he can't trust me to respect his privacy and he's never gone thru mine. the thing is i'm very devoted to him so obviously i've never given him a reason to even need to think about going into mine and honestly i wouldn't mind if he did. but now i'm scared that this was just a scapegoat for him to be a creep online and i have no way of knowing. i can't help but worry that he's gonna do me like his ex even though our relationship is much different. am i crazy and a bad girlfriend for not trusting him? or should i say something? i can't live in constant fear and anxiety. i don't want my time to be wasted. i love him more than anything but i'm 18 and i have my whole life ahead of me. no matter how much i love him i refuse to be fucked over for years but i don't want to confront him and look dumb. also- he had said if i ever wanted to look at something in his phone all i'd have to do was ask. but now that he knows i've looked he's just gonna be great at deleting stuff. i'm so torn and frankly worried that i'm gonna ruin the relationship with the man that i love, but i have no time to be disrespected and have my time wasted.",Whole_Resolution_396,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ioeeb/my_boyfriend_acts_weird_with_his_phone_recently/,1691218216.0,0.29
"Should I shoot my shot with someone who’s out of my league? I work for the same company as this guy and we worked together one time.

I say he’s out of my league bc he’s really ripped and im not. The best way to describe me is average I’m not that skinny and I’m not that fat. I am athletic but not like him. I’m also taller than him which I know can be turn off for a lot of guys.

"Dating ""scared"" [27M] 27M.  I have very little dating experience to speak of. I've been on a dozen or so dates over the course of my life. One very uncomfortable kiss I'm still embarrassed of and nothing even close to any sexual experience. I've started dating again recently, I'm just no longer enjoying being alone. I don't do a bad job of getting my foot in the door, so to speak. I'm ok looking, I get a few matches on the apps. A lot of conversations just die. But I'll get a date every now and then or will be in a situation occasionally outside the apps where I know a girl is interested.

  
Yet, I can do nothing about it even when I know or am fairly certain they have an interest. So it isn't a fear of rejection. I will often go hours ignoring text messages from women I'm talking to because I'm terrified to open them and think of something to say. I spend the date nervous even when it's going well because I know I'll have to decide whether to go for a kiss. Which I'm incapable of no matter how much I drink or what I do before. My brain short circuits. I had one girl I was talking to in a nightclub and the whole day before literally chase me down as I was leaving. I knew what was happening and did nothing.  I'm definitely attracted to women and the concept of having sex with them, but in practice having sex as a realistic prospect terrifies me and evokes no excitement.

  
I'm not totally socially inept, I chop it up fine with friends. I'm ok at work happy hours and stuff. I don't have any prudish or religiously conservative views I hold or was raised with. I *really* don't intend this as a brag, women showing interest isn't a common occurrence. And I'm not trying to sleep with every woman right away nor do I feel I'm owed that. 

  
I've discussed it in therapy before but haven't made progress. Always get some variation of ""just go do it"". Missing signals and kicking yourself afterwards sucks but isn't the worst. But these repeated experiences of knowing full well in the moment a girl I'm attracted to is interested and not being able to do anything become more and more painful. Is my only option at this point just to keep re-living these experiences and hoping one time it goes differently?

"Give it up? So I have a bit of a crush. I feel like that’s all I should describe it as, as I can’t say if we’re dating o not. So a couple of years ago, i met a guy I’d flirt wit and be very attracted to for the next year. We never even exchanged social media accounts, we have mutual friends so I suppose it was relatively simple for him to find me online. Anyways since then, we’d “innocently” flirt with one another via instagram dms often. Like I said it wasn’t until the following year, that we bump into each other again before he asks for my # and asks me out. We were flirting heavy, and I think it was obvious I was into him. Great. First date, cool, fun, he’s made it to date #2. Date #2 was much more chill and we ended up being together up until morning in his car. Right before I left, i reached for a hug and he pulled me in and kissed me. Idk what kind of sexual tension was in the air but it was the BEST I’ve ever been kissed. So the surprise factor was very high for me… and I didn’t kiss him back. He reached in again &amp; still, nothing from me. Lmaooo. Tbh he caught me so off guard and I hadn’t kissed in probably 2 years prior to that so I truly was in shock. 

Crickets…. He goes MIA for almost two months after that. He learns of my crush on him through a mutual friend (i think). This mutual friend hosted a party that we were both supposed to attend, but I had made plans prior to this party. When he realizes I’m at a different party via instagram stories, he dms me saying he wants to see me and is coming to me. Excited was a freaking understatement here. Upon seeing one another, he asks for kisses and I EAGERLY give them (being a little wine drunk in a bikini did not help). Back in his car, we talk and make out for a while until it’s time for me to go home. 

Couple days later, we’ve been FaceTiming, and the comfort and sexual tension between us is there. Seeing him at that party i passively bring up how he ghosted me after prior to that &amp; he didn’t really acknowledge it. During our FaceTime call the topic comes up again , ( I’m trying to recall to him a place by my house, and change my mind because I doubt he’d remember. HE basically jokes about and says yea “because he’s fake” which is what I told him, not explaining why, but it’s obvious he’s aware. 

That was Sunday, we spoke on Monday and that was the last I heard of him. Typically I don’t like clingy guys and he appears to be a very ambitious and hardworking man which I find so incredibly attractive, but gahdamn. I’m changing my number this weekend for reasons unrelated to him and I’m contemplating whether to text him with my new number which will probably strike conversation (because he does engage in conversation with me, but mostly when I initiate it). Or should I just take this as a clear sign that he’s simply just not that into me &amp; move tf on?

"Not sure what I should do! I need some advice from you all! 

About 7 months ago I met a girl whilst working at a bar and we really hit it off, numbers exchanged etc but I made it clear from the start that I had come out of a relationship and wasn't looking to jump straight back into anything, she hugely appreciated my decision but constantly flirted with me if we messaged. 

Unfortunately my d**k got the better of me and I flirted back until basically everything stopped. She said that I was sending mixed signals as I didn't want to start anything but likewise I was flirting with her. We decided I needed some space and that was it. 

Not much contact apart from the odd message now and again and a couple of months down the line I suggested we meet up for a coffee but she was dealing with some issues brushed it aside and ended up moving away. 

7months down the line I've not spoken with her since but NGL theres been times where she'll just pop into my head and I would love to get back in contact. I really felt like we had a great connection! 

Now works been crazy, I need a holiday and I suddenly thought, why don't I ask if she wants to come along, I know she loves travelling and she's always been pleasant with me when we've spoken. I've seen Reddit posts, online dating stories and other tales where people have gone abroad for first dates and all sorts and it's been really positive.

Part of me thinks worse case scenario is she'll say no and that will be it or she'll say yes and it potentially might lead to something amazing! But on the other hand, I have this feeling it's a s**t idea?

"My experience dating as a 39 [m] So, I'm turning 40 next month and I've been thinking a lot about how my personal life hasn't developed the way I hoped it would. No kids, never married (came very close about a decade ago)—and I take responsibility for the reasons why that is. An attenuated sense of ambition due to a lack of self-worth and identity through my twenties meant that I needed to be more professionally/self-centred in my early-mid thirties than could reasonably emotionally support a partner or a family. I needed to get my life back on track. Which it mostly is—mostly. Getting back into the habit of a romantic life in my late 30's has been a challenge, but I think in a lot of ways I'm more self-aware and able to deal with conflict and change that I've ever been. But somewhere along the line, the nature of the relationships and who I was dating changed.

Before I go any further, I need to make it clear that I don't hold anything against the people I've dated. They are where they are for their own reasons and I don't want to cast them in a bad light. I'm a big believer that people who are in a long-term relationship (even an unhealthy one) because they share a mindset to a great degree, for better or worse. And anything I say is meant to be self-reflective, not accusatory or derogatory, though I'll confess some frustration. The question I'm asking is, 'what does this say about me?' in addition to maybe sharing some common ground with other Redditors.

The woman I had just started dating when I turned 39 is a 33 y/o doctor who was in her penultimate year of her fellowship in a very intellectually demanding specialty (well say nephrology) and that was exciting. We'd have wonderful discussions about everything from kidney function to politics and how it intersects with public health and wine and culture. Being the nerd that I am, I'd found a Greek medical text by one of the earliest women to write about medicine, and I was going to translate it for her. (Metrodora, if you're interested—probably not her real name, given that it means ""Gift to the womb"" and it was a gynaecological text, so...pseudonym). But the idea of that as a gift was pretty quickly deflated. She was going through a bit of a crisis over how she wanted to relate to her work and if she even wanted to be a doctor. The sacrifices she'd signed up for were starting to sink in (her feelings on kids changed while we were dating) and the emotional cost of actually being a doctor was, I think, more than she could bear sometimes.

The intellectual conversations tapered off and dates consisted of going over to her place, cooking dinner, and watching reality tv or a film with a derivative plot. And lots and lots of wine. She confessed to getting blackout drunk once on a date, but I think it happened more than once. I'm not a big drinker—one glass and I'm done. Wine and beer are something to have with food for me, and hard liquor is something I have maybe twice a year. She'd polish off the bottle of pinot and then follow it up with a few beers while I nursed a coffee. I avoided intimacy when things crossed a line, and there were a few nights of drunk tears because I said no.

Intimacy wasn't usually great anyway, though. My general idea of what sex is or can be has always been that it's a form of communication that adds an extra depth to a relationship because of the shared act of an orgasm—which is, in itself a vulnerable feeling and series of emotions. Her expectation was almost for something degrading. I'm not exactly vanilla in what I like, but I like a connection and it was like she actively wanted to avoid that in favour of aggressive, disconnected sex that made me uncomfortable. She'd actively avoid climax, which, like, I always thought was the whole point? I don't know why that was, but I think sometimes people find rituals to act as vehicles for pre-existing emotions. Sex is a ritual of some of the most primal emotions.

The situation eventually became unworkable and we broke up after about six months. It was a civil and loving break-up. My exact words were, ""I know there is a better person out there who will be what you want."" I didn't and don't know that, but I do know I wasn't her person and I didn't want to waste any more of her time. I wanted to stay friends, because she's one of the most brilliant women I've ever met. But after a few check-ins, we stopped talking and I don't hold that against her.

I've been on a few dates since. One with a professor in her forties, who's finally in a place to settle down after years of field work—wants kids, picket fences, gardens, and Saturday morning trips to the farmer's market. And I get it—she spent the last 18 years of her life repeating the mantra ""one day."" It was immediately clear I couldn't be that for the exact reasons I made clear above—I'm about 5 years behind her.

I had three dates with a 35 y/o social worker who works in opioid drug-use harm-reduction, and that experience gave me pause. She brought a gift on my first date. I thought was sweet at the time, but it became pretty clear as things went on that it was something she did because of some deep-rooted trauma. The subtext was, ""please like me, because if you don't I'm afraid bad things will happen."" Trauma-bonding was something she would always confess she was avoiding, though our second date was to see an indy-doc about Residential schools.

Our third date was delayed because of her work. I was going to bring her dinner after what was going to be a very long day for her. I was going to make an easily portable riff on steak-frites and an arugula-apple-walnut-brie salad/tarragon vinaigrette and a French press affogato with biscotti for dessert. It took all day to prepare but she didn't get home until well after it was reasonable for me to come over. We rescheduled, I saved everything I could and said ""no worries, I get it, your work is chaotic."" But I was a little mad she couldn't've just let me know it wasn't going to be a good day.

When it came time for our date, she was completely MIA again. So I fed my dad what I'd made, went out to a show, and got a text around 9. She had profusely apologized, she was feeling down, fell asleep and didn't wake up until just then. But she wanted to see me after the show was over. Which was fine, I went over and we chatted. But as we talked it became very apparent she was enmeshed to an unhealthy degree with her clients—to the extent that it had the potential for extremely negative consequences for her exes and it terrified me. It was also apparent she may have been using. It was a very Platonic, politely distant date.

And that brings me to tonight. As I said, I have no ill will towards anyone I've described. I understand that life is complex and people can get a little lost. But like I said, I believe people who share an attraction, share a headspace and I'm thinking I've become a little lost and that my own emotional subtext behind this is that I'm trying to make someone happy. Which is impossible, no one can make their partner happy, except in the transient sense of ""I'm happy you're here"" or something similar. Happiness in the long term is an internal process and I'm afraid that the lack of self worth that attenuated my ambition is still with me. I'm going to need to change that.

Thank you for reading, apologies for the length.

Edit: Thank you for your replies and insights. I genuinely appreciate all of them. If I didn't directly reply, it's because I would have said over and over""thank you, this is something I definitely need to think about.""

"Girl I’m seeing is on Bumble I’m 30 male. I matched on bumble with a really pretty woman 10 months ago. Had a good conversation and she asked me out once, but I couldn’t make it and I tried asking her out a few times but didn’t work out but one day she tell me she’s seeing someone. So I immediately stop talking but few months down the lane, last April she wished me birthday and I ask her out and we meet. Three Sundays back to back. Had a Great time. She lives about 2 hours drive from my place and I decided to meet her and spent an entire day. I stayed over and we made out and did everything apart from penetration. She opened up about her life and her ex who got her pregnant and vanished. Some really successful Forbes 30 guy. She is also pretty sorted and is very successful for her age. We started talking on the phone on a regular basis and she mentioned one night that she is worried that I might be a rebound and I said it’s too soon for me to tell anything about it or her. The conversation after that was just her talking about how men hit on her all the time and about her exes. It turned me off but I didn’t think it would be so often. She tells me about how her parents are getting prospects for marriage. Again a big turn off.

One night she just mentioned how if she finds a good prospect she would just get married, to which I reacted and said please don’t tell me this cause if you respect me then this is not a good thing cause I’m still chasing. We had a bit off an argument and I said she’s the only one I’m talking to currently. She responded by saying that I don’t have to do this and I can talk to other woman but also apologised for being a bit insensitive regarding the prospect thingy. I stopped talking to her after that day. 

Also after meeting her I had uninstalled Bumble since I thought she’s the one or at least that I could try this time and concentrate on one woman.

Unfortunately after I stopped talking to her that night, I installed bumble again. 
I got sad and furious. 

I’m also an artist so I had started a sketch in the high of having feelings for her. I posted last week about it and she texted me and said how it made her day and it’s amazing. Called me the same night and spoke to me, and also did the same yesterday but she was very respectful and asked me about my day and life which she doesn’t do usually.

I saw her on Bumble a few hours ago and it is sort of eating me inside.

I’m thinking of asking her if she wants to date me, and decide for once and for all of we can be a thing. 

Should I do confront again? Since she already mentioned that she doesn’t wanna be exclusive.Or just let this one pass? Since I haven’t felt this since a long time maybe 5-6 years. 

I’m a bit head over heels. Should k try harder ? Cause she’s pretty af and maybe pretty woman like the hardcore chase.",Shree_murali93,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15iew32/girl_im_seeing_is_on_bumble/,1691190190.0,1.0

"Should I(23M) continue waiting for marriage when it seems a little futile? I've always kind of feel that I'd wait for marriage. I grew up quite hopelessly romantic, and have dabbled in religious faith at college.

That leaves religion as the main reason not to sleep around, and I guess I just feel quite unsure and find my faith nowhere near as strong as it was.

"Do I come clean or just deal with this situation when or if it comes up between me (23F) and my boyfriend (35M)? For context: we’ve been together for 6-ish months. Our only conflict to date has been that he is super busy and I don’t get to see him as much as I want. We see each other like 3-4 times a week, and then he has his kid Fri evening-Mon morning. Plus he runs his own company, so even on the days I see him, it’s usually not until like 7-8 or later. Our compromise was and is that he will do his best to call me for a couple minutes on the days we don’t see each other, unless he’s traveling on business, which is pretty rare. 

So, last weekend, he didn’t call me on Friday, which annoyed me but I was fine bc I knew he had a packed day and he still texted. Then Saturday, he didn’t call me, which again freaked me out a bit but I was calm about it bc I knew he was traveling with his kid and he still texted. Then, Sunday he still didn’t call me and then seemed to be ignoring my texts all day. And he’s never gone 3 days before. This is when I freaked out, I texted him like 10 times and called him 30 times throughout the day. I either thought he and his kid got hurt or he was deliberately ignoring me. He finally texted me back like 8 pm that night and was upset I was blowing him up when he was doing a beach day with his kid and couldn’t talk. We had a long talk when I saw him next, Monday, and cleared up some miscommunication about our compromises so this wouldn’t happen again. He also made it pretty clear that while he will work on his side of things, I need to work on controlling my emotions and not acting “crazy” bc that is not “something he can handle with everything else he has going on.” And yeah I agreed with him, I can be a little crazy when I feel passionately about someone, but I will work on feeling more secure with him and not act out in that way.

But….on Sunday when I was freaking out bc I thought something happened to him…I found his baby mama’s number online and texted her. All I said was “can you please call me, my name is ____, and I just wanted to talk to you about something.” By the time she replied asking if she knew me, my bf had already contacted me so I ignored her text. She doesn’t know who I am yet (I’ve only met the kid a couple times and we discussed being introduced slowly this month), but now she has my name and number. I’m worried that he will find out about this, and be very upset. Should I come clean now or just deal with it in the future and say she’s lying if she brings it up? 

I’m scared he will break up with me if he knows more about my craziness. While the baby mama and my bf are good co parents without a lot of negative drama, and he probably knows her personality more than mine this early in our relationship (he’s known her for 10 years and me for only 6 months)….I’m thinking he will trust me over her if I just lie and deny and say she spoofed my number. But also I don’t think she ever acted “crazy” like he knows I can. I know the right, moral thing is to come clean. But I’m scared, what should I do?? Maybe I’m making a bigger deal out of this than it is….maybe she won’t ever say anything.

"Lazy effortless dating I feel that’s all that is left anymore. I’m. 43f and I’ve been dating way too long ( married and divorced at 28 with a baby). 

Anyone I try to date just seems like they have half of an ass in it. I’ve been seeing a guy for a few weeks and I really like him as a person. But it’s just all so low effort. We did have one great all day date but otherwise, it’s me,
Going to his house with a last minute invite. Not just for a hook up, but still. He never texts , doesn’t make plans in advanced ( I know he isn’t seeing anyone else) and just all around is whatevs about it I guess.

I’m over it. I know I allowed it, but I’m so over it. The feeling of wondering and hoping if they are going to reach out and make plans and if they give a shit just isn’t worth it.

I’m just down, because this is the first one I thought had some potential in a while. I really liked him at first. 

And maybe he just is not all that in to me.  Truth be told, that’s the vibe I get from everyone I date. Into me a little, but not enough for effort and can take or leave me.

"I met a guy a week before he goes back to his home state ****The majority of this is the history behind the time we spent together. skip to the end for the TL;DR****

I (F18) met this guy (M21) at a bar around a month ago. There was an open mic going on and I watched him perform. Instantly i knew there would be a connection, as we had very similar music taste. I normally never approach anyone, but i approached him. 

We talked a bit and he ended up leaving before I performed. I got his instagram but never really hit him up. About a week ago he messages me and we set up a music jam together. We hung out, wrote a song together and had a great vibe. Across the weekend we watched the sunset, talked, wrote another song, and got a setlist together to perform at the next open mic. At this point I didn’t feel anything for him but i had a genuine interest and connection with him.

We perform our set (great chemistry and song writing energy) and then we spontaneously make plans to go to the beach the next day.

We spent the entire day together. We went to an ice cream shop where the guy gave us a bunch of free samples and i handed him the mini spoon, he didn’t take it from me, but let me hold it while he tasted the sample. At first i didn’t realize but there were definitely some flirty vibes going on. He found small sweet moments to make physical contact (a shoulder push, a tap etc). It was really easy to be around him, we laughed a lot, and i felt like i could be myself. I didn’t have to try to be anything and he didn’t judge me for it. (we were both very sarcastic and understood each other too)

Once we arrived at the beach we spent time in the water and the waves were rough and would drag us everywhere. He made sure to look out for me and told me he had my back. He also called me cute when i used my towel as a cape hehe. We laid down on our picnic blanket side by side and stared at the sky, talking about everything and nothing. On the car ride home i tried to find excuses to touch his hand and at one point just put my hand out hoping he’d take it in his (he did). 

He was hesitant with his actions and backed off at times however. It was like he didn’t want to get too close because he knew that this would be our last time seeing each other before he left.

But the way he looked at me was as if there were a million galaxies among which only he could explore with raging curiosity. It was the pure intent and love i saw behind his eyes that made me realize just how much i liked him. 
Peculiar and coincidental similarities kept showing up. From our ideals/values/politics, to high school demographics, family background and general interests.. the person i’d always been looking for showed up so nonchalantly.  

But he was only here for the summer on an internship. Now he’s headed back to his hometown and then his university. I don’t know if i’ll see him again, but i want to keep in contact. We decided to write an EP together (hopefully we follow through). I don’t think i’ve ever connected with someone on this spectrum as i have with him. I cried when i had to hug him goodbye, knowing it could very well be the last time i’d ever see him. I think he feels the same way; he said we have a good connection, it’s just really really bad timing and place.

i want to get to know him more, however it feels like he’s hesitant to when i try. i think he feels the same way because of the time we spent together. what do i do?

TLDR:
I got to know this guy over a week and realized we had a strong once in a lifetime connection. He’s left the state and probably won’t return here without a good reason.

Fading (Break-up) I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.  I (39M) started dating a (32F) and things were absolutely amazing the first 2 months. With that being said the relationship was moving a blistering fast pace and we got serious really quick. We both fell madly in love and we were seeing each other daily.  Her behavior quickly began to change and she started having extreme mood swings which included her getting very angry at me for absolutely nothing. She apologized after this happened but then confessed that she had stopped taking her meds for her Schizophrenia/Bipolar.  She also confessed to having a drug addiction.  I didn't realize how bad both issues were until this past 2 months she has been a different person everyday and usually doesn't even remember the previous day or conversations we have.  She asked me for space and time to get her life together about a month ago.  We haven't seen each other in 2 weeks.  She says she wants to still be together and doesn't want to ruin things with me.  I'm not sure I can continue this roller coaster but I don't want to abandon her as she doesn't have many friends or people she can talk to.  I just don't think I want to try to continue anything romantic with her.  I'm hoping I can just ease off and things die out on their own.  I've tried to get her help with her drug addiction and even to get her to get back on her meds but with no success.  Should I just remain in limbo and keep my distance?

"I (24M) am not enjoying the dating scene due to a string of disappointment For a bit of background, I would say that I am fairly attractive with a good muscular build and decent sense of fashion. I am very ambitious, fit and I'm tall too. I am confident in most scenarios and I try be as chivalrous as I can and a gentleman while also being very transparent about myself as I don't want to be dishonest.   


I decided to get on Hinge and after 20+ matches, plentiful phone calls, several dates and few nights over, I'm writing this. I don't feel like I have had any luck with women. I am always seemingly told how much of a catch I am only to be completely ghosted by these girls.   


My most recent date went from ""I like you alot"" to ""I wouldn't want to see you again on a romantic basis"" in a single night. I was left feeling really ugly and insecure with myself. It's how I have been feeling after these girls have said such nice things to me and validating me only to not show me the time of day. 

And all these women that I have met, that I have kissed and I have been completely sincere to are very beautiful and genuinely fun people, but they all seem to have just taken me for a ride in one way or another.

I really just want genuine love and appreciation, but this isn't doing it for me. Right now, I am thinking of just going cold turkey and deleting all my socials and just spend my days painting and animating. 

But I don't want to give up either, because to be loved for who I am and not an idea is what I am after. I don't want sex, I don't want compliments, I just want that sense of genuine appreciation and comfort within myself and in another.

I really don't know what to do because at this point, I am left with a dry phone filled with girls who took me for a ride and left me with a bruised ego. In all honesty, I feel so disrespected and so underminded.

"27M Dating pool in Dallas/FW/Arlington Does anyone here live in the DFWA area and wanna share their experience dating here? My experience has been terrible so far. I haven't met anyone who's serious and not weird as hell. I have yet to meet an attractive girl who's actually looking to date. These days everyone seems to be just using people for entertainment. The amount of times I've seen or heard the ""im just looking"" or ""im just here because im bored"" from women on dating apps is astounding. I've been wanting to try my luck just approaching women but I feel in today's time it's a little more difficult to navigate that situation. On top of all that, I'm currently crashing with my parents while my pops and I build a business together, it's financially convenient. I have a decent job and a car but I feel the living situation is a henderence. I dont wanna stay single but im not going to create expenses for myself just to impress someone who will likely leave anyway. I guess the advice I'm seeking right now is this: How do I find women who want to date, without using dating apps(im over it they suck)? How are yall talking to women? Are you using lines or tricks?

"How common is it ACTUALLY that women have an OF? I would assume, and also think that more women than not DON'T have an OF but, being on Tinder and other dating apps, along with Reddit... It sure seems like most do have an OF...I know that's not exactly the greatest way to determine anything but we tend to believe things the more we come across something, ya know?

I'd like to think that the majority don't have one but at the same time, I also feel like the more attractive a woman is the more likely she is to have one...

idk how to even start...this guy I'm working with confuses me a lot and I'm not sure if he's attracted to me or just wants to be friends 

some of the things he did so far that really made me go ""hmm""🤔: 

1. proposed to me to eat together everyday since we both struggle with it bc of how busy work gets (he said it can help with motivating each other)
2. asked for a hug once (it was around the first 2 weeks of knowing each other) and was really hurt when I declined but a month ago I gave him one on his b-day and he was like ""yay I finally got my hug from you"" 
3. asked for the key to my locker as soon as his shift ended saying he brought a gift for me (it was a tulip but carved, color green - ""just like your hair"", he said) when I asked him ab it, he said he had a friend visiting from Netherlands and he asked his friend to buy that for him...and he also has one (he said it's a matchy) and the main reason he gave it to me was bc he thought I deserved to receive flowers??? 
4. we talk a lot on whatsapp, insta and tiktok and it's not a normal flow...we usually have around 40-80 messages from each other in a row (but we take like a day or two to reply to everything) 
5. he invited me recently to the barbie movie (first instance was with other colleagues but then he saw I wasn't that interested - bc I only get along with him so he was proposing to go just the 2 of us so I'd feel more comfortable) 
6. he's usually very talkative to other girls at work but with me not so much...he's only talkative virtually 
7. he knows I'm depressed and don't get out of the house much apart from going to work and shopping for bare necessities so he offered to help me with that, saying we could do activities together and hang out 
8. he asked about how my love life is going 
9. he jokingly said he was observing me and only me all along",Early-Influence-8453,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ialvt/coworker_m_24_wants_us_f_25_to_become_best/,1691180245.0,0.99

"LDR - fails to make plans? Guys - what do you think? I met a guy online, we were chatting for a couple of weeks and got pretty deep. Both of us have very similar life experiences,  backgrounds and careers. He lives a little over 2 hr drive away from my city (not a problem for me). I am well off, he struggles financially but is slowly recovering (valid reasons to do with his last 2 exes). He did say that me having a lot more money is a bit of an issue for him (hurts his male pride - his words). 
I had to do a quick business trip to his city so we met in person. Had a great time, spent the nights together at my hotel, everything was great. I feel like we really connected on a deeper personal level and definitely want to keep seeing him. 
So I'm back home now and back to online chatting. We talk first thing in the morning and last thing at night. He's interested, responsive and empathetic, talks about things he'd like to do and experience together. But here's the thing. He's not brought up any actual ideas of how/when or even suggested to meet up again. I mentioned to him last night I'll have a few unexpected extra days off work next weeks and his reply was just ""oh, nice!"".

"she’s pregnant.. with someone else’s? 
[M21] [F20]

I’ll keep this as short as possible

Beginning of this year we got very close then life got in the way and we went our separate ways. 7 months later she texts me wanting to hangout and try again. 

We make plans to hangout July 17th (remember this) and things went great. We caught up, grabbed food and that was about it. She kept mentioning how she was on her period which I assumed was her test to see if I was just tryin to hookup or not. 

We then keep in touch, text consistently for the next 10 days and on July 27th she came over to my house. She mentions how she’s off of her period and one thing leads to another and we hookup for the first time. 

The next day (July 28th) she late night texts me to come over and we do it again. 

Both times I wore protection and never finished. I checked both condoms and none were broken, and both were spermicide condoms. 

We haven’t hung out since- we’ve kept in touch but not as much as before. I wake up to her freaking out.

She’s pregnant. How so soon?! I never finished.. wasn’t she just on her period?

She agrees that it’s most likely not mine, and she she lied to me about being on her period. Turns out she’s missed it for 2 months already. 

I ask how many other dudes she’s hooked up with within the last 2 months and she says “i’ve hooked up with a lot of people” and she has no clue who’s it could be.

I’m lowkey freaking out overthinking myself. Having a kid is one of my biggest fears right now- there’s no way it could be mine right?

Is it wrong to expect your FWB to support you during a pregnancy scare...after assaulting you? So I started dating this guy he is a stoner so we smoke usually when we meet up I'm a newbie and often smoke way too much. I already told him I dont want to go past making out on the first date and when i would be comfortable with sex but he sees these as not boundries but challenges to overcome. We ended up doing everything but sex the first date due to being on drugs I guesse. It felt good tho he is very sexually compatible with me so i decided i wanted to see him again even tho i actually didnt like him as a perosn. On the actual date he made a bad impression....then after the second date I said I think I wanna be FWB cuz I like ur sexual skills but ...I dont think i could date someone like him seriously. I asked if that's ok if I hurt his feelings he said no all he cares about is that I'm in his bed rn so I was like good. We end up having sex many times and he has unprotected sex with me when I'm toooo high even tho I told him not to many times that day. I know it's weird but I always get obsessed with him after sex so I didnt even get mad at the time...but i went home and said I'm scared of pregnancy and STI and he offered no support was kinda rude told me he is tired of hearing me cry and overthink the same shit for days and abit emotionally abusive to the point where I left him temporarily. I guesse I had feelings for him I asked him to define this and if he just likes me for sex (I know I started the FWB label ok) he doesnt communicate much at all even in the begining very avoidant and shy and doesnt talk to ppl in general. It was a sitiationship tbh and it got confusing for me espailly since the sex felt intense for me....so I kept trying to update any new feelings but he never spoke to me much even over text I wasnt  sure what this was but we both seemed busy and idc if he was using me for sex as I wanted that originally but thought maybe he developed some feelings like me? Anyways we stopped talking for awhile but we reconnected he basically said this isnt a realtionship just sex okkkk I mean I started that so I get that but it hurt alittle. But I didnt really know what was happening it all happned so fast...I didnt know we werent dating tbh but now I know and my question is since he wasnt my bf or romantic interest just some FWB is it ok for him to act like that during a pregnancy scare/STI? Espailly after he did that too me knowing i didnt want it. I've been depressed in my personal life and he never supported me but I thought for something he did to me he should? Am I wrong?

"Ghosting or taking space? The guy I’ve been seeing for a month told me 2 hours before our hangout that he can’t make it bc he wants to rest. I was so mad bc he did this before where we had our first date planned on a Wednesday and he told me he would give me details on Tuesday. Not only did he not send the details but he also ignored me on Wednesday and didn’t even apologize for missing the date. 

We finally met up in person to discuss him missing the date and he told me he was depressed and lacked motivation to do anything. I felt bad but I didn’t want to give up on him so I decided to try and be patient.

So when he was flaking again, I snapped. I texted him some words that I wish I could have rephrased better. Instead I lashed out and I feel so bad 

I’m trying to be patient and understanding but that second flake just made me so upset. It’s been 2 days and he hasn’t replied to me. Since it’s only been a month I’m sure he thinks it’s not worth the effort but I’m so hung up on the fact that he said he would “never ghost people” and that “I don’t believe  in completely cutting someone out of my life”.

I’m already in the process of moving on but I can’t help but wonder if maybe he’s taking some space? Depression is no joke and I would ghost me too if a girl I’ve know for 30 days snapped at me.

"Skinny love? Help me not get confused. 
been feeling something towards this friend from high school. we’re not close in high school but when we went to college we got to meet up frequently because suddenly, we belonged to the same group of friends. Now, were both 26 and still meeting up 3-5 times a year with the same group of friends (all of us are busy). We don’t talk at all via soc med — only during birthdays, before hanging out with friends and just some random and sudden urge to want to hang out together (don’t really push thru). But whenever we drink with our friend group, we would end up sitting beside each other, somehow stealing glances and help out each other out with some errands and to-dos in the most subtle and “intimate” way. 

The last time we hang out, we were sharing a pack of candy and it might not be much but i feel like it was sort of romantic how we would share the pack of candy. We don’t even need to talk before knowing which candy to get, we just know what to give and ask from each other subconsciously. He’s also very attentive to the songs I play (i pick the music in every drinking session) and he would ask me to listen or play a song he thinks is good or i would love — not even minding other people around. 

During the last time we’ve been together, before standing up our chairs to pack up, he said thank you for me allowing our friend group to drink again in my house (we usually drink in my house), then he asked me to do a high five with him but his hands lingered more than they should and he ended up holding my hand for a good 5 seconds, like actually holding to it. And our hands stayed like that for a good 10-15 seconds before our friends turned their heads towards us. Tbh, i think both of us didn’t want to let go. After that we went out the gate. We bid two of our other friends goodbye (theyre riding the same car), and right before this guy went to his car, he said thank you again and asked for a friendly side hug which haha lasted for about 5-10 seconds again. He kept saying thank you and good night too. I know he’s not drunk too. 

As much as I want to convince myself those things doesn’t really matter because he’s not even saying anything or doing anything after our every encounter, I still feel like there’s something there. Am i being delusional or? I can share more about our backstory (nothing much) if it helps.

I feel like i have a crush on him since high school but it’s so complicated these past years — he has a kid, but his baby mama and him are not together ever since, his baby mama is married, he’s a nephew of my boss at the same time.

I know if we go out on vaca I may not have as much fun as I could. He does not enjoy getting out much. But I believe he would cover the cost for majority of the trip. And it would be nice quality time we do not often get due to work. I know this is such a first world dilemma, but I'm curious about others thoughts on the matter. Who would be the better choice to make these memories with?",PalmTree_Paradise1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15hzyrv/30_f_upcoming_vacation/,1691155327.0,0.75
Which race is attractive to women black men or white men? So some people say this is not important but it actually is because race matters when dating and there are definitely a majority of women that find either black men or white men more attractive than the other race that’s a fact and I’ve asked multiple people this question and never got a clear answer because people are afraid of this question. This is important! Idk why ppl duck this question.,MarcusCousinIII,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ilj0j/which_race_is_attractive_to_women_black_men_or/,1691208665.0,0.28
"Is it creepy to follow someone you’ve met in person but didn’t exchange further details? I (25f) met a guy (20’s M) out whilst at a club on holidays. We live 20 mins from each other, before we could exchange details he had to leave. 

He came back but I was so drunk and became rude, told him to go away and more. I want to just apologise. I’ve found him on Instagram because my cousin went to his school. 

Would it be creepy, if I reach out, with no mutuals? Or even just follow?",Fair_Price_3140,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15hzm99/is_it_creepy_to_follow_someone_youve_met_in/,1691154427.0,1.0
"Coworker So I have mixed signals about my office coworker, because he is married and first i think, he is just being nice and kind, but then i think there is something more... He always looks at me with that special smile and his eyes, helps me when i have some problems, we work together in marketing... He gives me shoulder massages, often touches my arm, shoulder, back... Buys me food but everything is so confusing for me because he is married and has one little beautiful girl, i feel so guilty for having some kind of feelings for him, and so sad beacuse i can't do anything about that because that will be awful, destroy someone's family, so i just keep dreaming about him.",Sweaty_Emergency_314,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15i57b8/coworker/,1691167663.0,0.67
"A guy I met during my trip to Spain got a little clingy. Advice needed. I’m a solo traveler, and I often travel a lot. During spring this year, I traveled to Spain, and during my visit there, I met a local, and we connected really well. Ever since, we have been talking a lot online, via FaceTiming, etc. I really like him as an acquaintance. He's been asking me quite often when I’m going back to Spain again or when he can come visit me here in the States. He asked more than usual. I feel like he's might be little obsessed with me. We definitely had good chemistry when we were hanging out. I enjoy him as company, and I don’t think I’m ready to be in a relationship, especially since he is in another country. I’m not really into long-distance relationships either. Am I getting the wrong message, or does he just really want to hang out? I'm 27, and he is 26.",Mizz_Alisa,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15i53oe/a_guy_i_met_during_my_trip_to_spain_got_a_little/,1691167429.0,0.67
"Long distance for a year? My (20 f) boyfriend (23 m) have been dating middle distance for about 7 months now. He is in the military and is stationed about 2 hours away, and I am living with a friend's family, working full time, and going to school part time. 
Recently we had a big argument and I think it was all triggered by my situation. I get frustrated bc I feel trapped here and even tho I work overtime every week, I still can't afford to live on my own in this economy. And I hate parasiting off of the people who care about me. So I let the whole situation and hopeless attitude affect my mood and our relationship. 
Anyway, I decided that joining the military myself is a good idea. And considering I would have a salary, have school paid for, and be able to pursue a career that allows my financial independence, I was really happy with the decision. 
Except I would ship to BMT at the beginning of next year, and then to tech school, and who knows where I will be stationed. My bf also deploys for 6 months in May. 
So overall it would be almost a year of little contact and not seeing each other at all. 
And I am scared. But, I know I cannot let our relationship determine my career choices bc then resentment might subconsciously affect my attitude towards him. 
So I'm determined to make this work, I just don't know how. And both of us have voiced fears that the other will meet someone better.",Due-Drink9590,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15hz2ke/long_distance_for_a_year/,1691152979.0,1.0
Help!! I sent nudes to this guy I’ve never met before. I have in writing that he would not save to camera roll only to chat. I have his location and his name and his Venmo.

Why are only younger girls attracted to me? I (17M) seem to only get attention from girls that are younger than me (~2 years younger) who try talking to me and impressing me and get nothing from people in my age range. I don’t want to date any of them because they are too young thats weird.  But clueless as how to attract girls that are my age and would be fine dating. Any advice would be helpful.,Expensive_Fox_7686,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15hqy2h/why_are_only_younger_girls_attracted_to_me/,1691126436.0,0.82
"How to deal with early relationship anxiety? Hi guys. I (25F) have just started seeing an amazing guy (28M). After really creating the best possible (single) life for myself with no plans for dating, this came out of the blue. Trouble is, I can sometimes be incredibly anxious due to abusive relationships, and I want to make sure I proceed as best as possible.

We were vague friends beforehand and I think he’s really great. It’s very early days (two weeks), but he’s said a couple of things to me that have really made me think this could be something special. He’s mentioned continuing seeing each other a few times, he’s told me he’s smitten with me, he’s in the right headspace for a relationship, and he’s mentioned telling his friends all about me. He’s been away for a bit on his holidays, and I’ve said not to worry about texting me until he gets back as I want him to relax and have a nice time. He said he’ll let me know when he’s free once he’s back. 

Firstly, the lack of comms (although requested from my end) has triggered a lot of painful feelings for me. This is my issue to deal with, not his. I’ve not told him I have been in abusive relationships before but was wondering if I should say something like ‘when you say X it means a lot to me’. Any other advice would be great. 

Secondly, I’ve worried myself that he didn’t really mean the things he’s said. It’s really been stressing me out as similar has happened in the past but I’m trying so hard to be logical and respect his rest time.

Finally, any other advice on how to look after myself and make sure I don’t put any of this on him if we continue seeing each other.",CulturalNerve94,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15i3pbf/how_to_deal_with_early_relationship_anxiety/,1691164280.0,0.67
"(M22) Overall personal review/advice I'm getting into dating again recently, on apps or in person, and I'm curious about just getting me as a whole reviewed.
I'm talking physically, personality, interests, hobbies, career, standards, etc. Everything

I would consider myself to be a fairly unique person and I want to know what's good about me, what's okay, and what could be better, in detail.
I'm interested in really finding someone right for me and I want to make sure I'm taking the right steps to get there, and honestly I wouldn't mind a little validation and constructive criticism.

I'm not fully comfortable sharing all of those details publicly but if anyone is interested I would love to dm privately, preferably women attracted to men since that is who I'm looking to date, but I'm open to any advice",myguyben,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15i3o28/m22_overall_personal_reviewadvice/,1691164204.0,0.5
