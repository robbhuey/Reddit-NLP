"Disclose racial preferences up front Ever  realize someone didn‚Äôt  want a  serious relationship with you because you‚Äôre not white? They see you as fine to date, but they never saw you as someone they would enter into a serious relationship with and eventually marry. To those that say stick to your own race, then you could avoid this feeling but not everyone uses racial preference  as the only reason to try and date someone. If someone has on their profile they prefer same race or religion, I respect that and don‚Äôt consider that discrimation.  It‚Äôs understandable you would want to date closer to you in terms of ubringing especially if you are close to your family and are considering kids in the future. My issue is after dating someone and then getting the vibes they just picked you because you fit whatever sterotype and are suppose to be fun. Especially coming from someone who you thought was not race orientated. I am really sad because I really liked them. Not going to explain further since it‚Äôs too long to go into detail, but I got some comments that made me really uncomfortable. If I decide to try and date someone else that is not the same race as me, I am just going to ask straight up on the first date, how they feel about mixed race dating.",glittermoonstone,0,1690819778.0,0.5,1264,228,1264

"Guy and i are way too attached Tldr: Here's my dilemma. Guy and I are very close friends. We treat each other as confidantes and he said he trust me more than 100%. We live in different cities but the thing is I often go to his city because of a problem that I have..which lately is getting better because over time I'm healing although not totally healed.

Everytime I go to his city and is about to leave, he keeps asking when I'll come back or I'll be leaving for good and then proceeds to question his life and where he will retire. Once I said I'll be traveling to another country and he's like are you leaving me. 

When i left and told him i was in the airport, he got very emotional and told me he will miss me and he's praying for my safety. 

Then, finally he visited my city due to a common friend's event. He then asked me what my plans are and where would I really be whether I'll be in his city or in my city for good and he said I'm considering living in your city and I don't want that we might go in opposite directions. 

On top of this, we are extremely emotionally attached so my issue here is I'm not entirely sure of going to his city but he asked me again when I'll come back to his city, I did say I have plans of going few weeks from now. He proceeded to plan going somewhere with me. When we are apart, we totally miss the company. When we're together, we're the happiest.

It's just that it feels like we are so committed haha but I'm a bit pressured whether this is really going to be my plan because traveling is putting a dent to my finances. He also told me though that he is dating people. I'm not hurt but I just feel that there are strong emotions involved here both in my part and on his part and we don't act like these with people we are friends with.

So I'm totally stressed out with the level of committment this entails (having to see each other seems to be a need. He also told me he needs me because with me his guards are down)

"Thinking about getting into international dating. Any tips for a newbie? I'm pretty close to done with the dating scene where I live in London, UK. I'm not a particularly attractive man so my success rate on Hinge, Bumble etc is pretty low. I get the odd first date every couple of months or so, but usually get ghosted afterwards even if the date went well, I guess women just have so much choice nowadays it's difficult to stand out. 

I've never done well at bars etc here either, again largely due to not being great looking. Been single for over 2 years now and I'm feeling very burnt out and wanting to try something new.

For the record, I'm 28, own my own flat, good job, 6'3 and in good shape. My face isn't great and I'm a bit skinny though which is what I think drags me down.

Lately I've been watching videos etc of the 'passport bro' movement, as well as vlogs of guys from Europe and the US who date in places like the Philippines, Thailand and Latin America, and pretty much all of them say the same thing, that dating in these places is far easier than in the West, and how there's more respect (ie less ghosting etc). I am NOT looking into doing this because I want a sex slave, traditional wife or anything of that nature before I get any comments about that.

I'm thinking this is something I want to pursue or at least give a go. For those of you who've done similar, how's it going? What are some nuggets of wisdom you could give to someone thinking of trying international dating for the first time?",CalaisImpreza,0,1690652684.0,0.5,1522,286,1522

She told me about some sexual experiences she had on the past and she even gave one of her boyfriends a BJ on the bloody park (it makes me very uncomfortable she tells me this kind of things BTW)

I do enjoy the conversations though, he asks very personal stuff and shares personal stuff which is refreshing as I don't have friends to chat to at the moment, and it's stimulating.

"How do you make your boyfriend's ex get over him? Hi me (21) and my boyfriend (22) were walking on the street last week when we saw and met his ex again.


 They exchanged a few greetings and life updates, and i also greeted her (i knew her way back in highschool because all of the 3 of us graduated in the same school. We weren't exactly the friends type because i only knew her through our mutual friends). And that night when we came home and settled down for bed, his ex messaged my boyfriend consulted me and showed me their convo.


 In the convo she said that she still wasn't gotten over him and she still loves him. But can't do anything about taking him back because i am here, his girlfriend. My boyfriend rejected her and draws boundaries that they won't be together again but his ex is just persistent. 


I got mad and took over my boyfriend's phone to talk to her not knowing it was me who was she talking to. I got her to say the reason why she hasn't ""moved on"" after all these years and she said some pretty much depressing reasons. 


Now this situation where my boyfriend's ex still wants him bugs me as a girlfriend, i mean who wouldn't right? I trust my boyfriend as he is a great man. But as a woman, i really want her to stop liking my man and get over him. But again, she said some pretty depressing reasons why she hasn't moved on and i'm afraid this might ruin her mentally or anything.    I'm not going to disclose any information about her for confidentiality and as a respect for her too. 


And now i feel hurt for her as a fellow woman but what she's doing isn't healthy for her. My boyfriend tells me to stop feeling sorry for her and that we should just focus on chasing her away but i can't. I've seen a similar situation as her from one of my close friends and i know how devastating it can be. It destroyed my close friend, and it will also destroy her (ex).


So the point is, how do i make my boyfriend's ex get over him without the cost of her insanity? Should i just stop being empathic for her?",Foreign_Reaction_888,0,1690881544.0,0.5,2037,391,2037
"I'm taking my best friend of 10 years on a date this Friday. How can I escalate/impress her beyond what she already knows about me? We met at the start of high school and have always been close. I've had feelings for her off and on over the years and I know that she has as well. Probably less than me, but I'm also my own worst critic. Lately we've been talking much more than usual and it's been about things like what we want in life, what we find attractive in a partner, our goals for work/family/where we want to live, etc. I've always known we're similar (duh, that's why we're friends), but it's been eye-opening to have some of those more vulnerable conversations and realize how aligned we really are.  
  
For context, this is a distance situation. I see her several times per year since we have the same home-town. We could pretty easily increase that number, but we're about 5 hours away from each other. We'll both be home to see mutual friends next weekend and I'm taking her on a date. We've been out one-on-one many times before, but this is the first time it's been super intentionally called a date. We're going to a cinema club (mutual hobby) to see something lighthearted and will probably grab drinks afterward.  
  
I'm not nervous about what we'll talk about or if we'll have a good time; I know all of that will work out. What scares me is escalating beyond our friendship. I know I should tell her she looks beautiful, break the touch barrier, find a moment for a kiss, etc. I want those things too - she is beautiful and I'm excited for the chance to be intimate. I can't help but feel like I'm playing with fire though.  
  
Any advice on making those jumps from friends to more? Ladies who have dated or otherwise been intimate with someone they knew for many years prior, what did they start to do differently that changed your perspective on the relationship? Are there any boundaries you would place that are different from a first date with someone you've just met?

"How Can I Stop Dating App Addiction? I never realized I was addicted to dating apps until I saw a pattern among my friends as well as myself. I need to check my messages every day, a few times a day at least.

When I meet people in person from the dating app, I always keep thinking there is someone else better and I usually find excuses to not want to see that other person again...or vice versa as it happens to me.

If things do go well with someone I meet from a dating app I still feel the need to go on the dating apps and respond to or send new notes to other people.

I noticed in the last 20 years I have bounced around from one dating app to another on and off over a period of those years.

"I (21F) breakup with my boyfriend (21M) of three years and started dating another guy (21M) just after three days of breakup I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy for more than 3 years, and some time back, we decided to end the relationship. The main reasons for us to end our relationship were our constant fights, lack of understanding between us, insecurities, and all that kind of stuff.  
  
But 3 days after our breakup, I started dating one of my close friends who knows everything about me and my relationship status.  
  
Now the issue is that even when I was dating my ex, I was confused about my feelings for my current boyfriend. Initially, when I realized this, I used to tell myself some excuse or another and try to forget about it. I didn't break up with my ex then because I loved him a lot and was not sure about my feelings for that friend.  
  
Since then, it has been very hard for me to trust myself. I always fear that if my feelings for my current boyfriend change or I start feeling for someone else, then I'll end up hurting him as well.  
  
My current boyfriend knows all about my situation and my fears. He always tells me that I should not blame myself for it and start trusting myself again. But no matter how hard I try, I always end up thinking about it the same way because the fact that I got attracted to someone else even when I was in a relationship (I loved my ex a lot, and even after I got confused about my feelings for that friend, I was still sure that what I felt for my ex was very strong) is something I could never justify.

"My fifth date‚Äî‚Äîabout my dating experience on a herpes dating site Navigating the dating scene as someone living with herpes can be complex, but a herpes dating site has made things considerably simpler. This is the account of my fifth encounter on this platform, a one-night stand with a woman, shared in a mild and straightforward manner.

This woman, let‚Äôs call her Jane for the ease of this narrative, had an online presence that resonated with me. Harboring a common ground owing to our shared experiences, we started conversing and developed a reasonable rapport. Eventually, we agreed on meeting in person at a nearby bakery.

Our real-life interaction was no different from our online conversations: comfortable and engaging. Jane was equally charismatic in person, and our conversations flowed naturally. We spent the day discussing our interests, sharing anecdotes, and gradually feeling more comfortable with each other.

As it grew late, Jane invited me over to her place. Maintaining mutual respect and understanding for our situation, we mutually decided to extend the boundaries of our relationship. We both knew the precautions and boundaries required due to our condition. Consent was a crucial part of our interaction, and we did not disregard it at any point.

Our one-night stand was gentle and respectful, nothing more than an extension of our connection. We both respected each other‚Äôs spaces and understood our circumstances, making our intimate interaction less daunting and more approachable.

"I'm in love with my ex, and I love my boyfriend, but I'm not in love with him. This is really long because there's a lot to explain so I'm really sorry. 
For the sake of privacy and having no confusion, we'll call my ex salad and my boyfriend forklift. Random names that correspond with them.

Backstory on my ex:
We met when I started working at a restaurant. He was the salad/fry cook, and I started as a dishwasher. I always found him to be pretty cute, but didn't really have any feelings for him or at least didn't realize that I did, until I worked my first double. We have a thing that he does with jar lids. He can fold them in half by squeezing them in one hand. Hard-core grip strength. And then I would unfold them, make them look nice again. He does this, and I get the idea to turn it into a heart shape. He had to help me with this. I wrote inside, something like ""you're doing great"", just something positive. For a while, he had it hanging on the fridge in his station. We became friends on Facebook, started talking more. And on mother's day in 2022, confessed feelings for each other over text while at work. This was the beginning of something that would tear me into shreds later on. We started seeing each other, sleeping together. But kept it ""private"", it was secret. No one could know. He didn't have a girlfriend or anything, but we worked together and didn't want coworkers in our business. However, no one knew that he was seeing ANYONE. He literally kept it entirely secret. Fast forward to July. He had given me a key to his apartment, I had face wash and moisturizer in his showers, lingerie in his bedroom. It was my second home. We had a mutual coworker who had just quit, we'll call her airplane. Airplane was pretty and skinny, but she was quirky and annoying. She confided in me that she had feelings for Matt. Me, being stupidly loyal, told her I didn't think he was seeing anyone. Then they start talking. She sends me screenshots all the time of their conversations, asking if I think he likes her. I'm always very vague but it seemed perfectly friendly at first. Until it wasn't. Until he was flirting. He tried to say he was just being friendly, but it sunk me. In late july, they both went offline at the same time and stayed offline. This was unusual because salad was pretty active on Facebook and I knew he wasn't at work. So I shoot airplane a text, asking how she's doing. She tells me she's hanging out and cuddling with salad. And then that he kissed her. I text salad and tell him I'll be getting my things the next day, and I don't want to talk to him again. However, we were coworkers. So we tried to be friends and make nice. I was also head over heels for him. He was the first person I'd been able to commit to in years. We end up hooking up again. But he's still not ready for a commitment or something. So we argue, and I block him. Now enters my current boyfriend. 

Boyfriend's backstory:
He is my best friend's boyfriend's brother. That's how we met. I always thought he was cute. In semptember, he gets drunk and admits he has feelings for me. I say I wouldn't mind talking. We talk for a bit and start dating. Things were going great for about a month, until he gets drunk and yells he doesn't love me and never could. We break up, he apologizes, we get back together. This went on for a couple more months, alcohol always being the source of our problems. We've been off and on since, and we're currently on. I do love him, but he doesn't make me feel the way salad does. Ever. Sex is boring with him, whereas salad does lots of different things to stimulate me. I still talk to salad, we slept together right before forklift and I got back together. I told forklift he'd have to cut way down on the drinking if this was gonna work. It seems like he has, but he still drinks beer like water. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not being fair to Forklift because I can never truly love him the way I love Salad. But I don't think Salad will ever want anything more than the occasional hookup from me. Does anyone have advice? 


Other info that may be relevant: 
Salad is 8 years older than me. 
Forklift is 6 years older than me. 
I am of legal age, and I have a great relationship with my father, just like older guys. 
I had issues with commitment for a few years because an ex burned me pretty bad, but Salad was like the light at the end of that tunnel.",femurfatalle,0,1690486994.0,0.5,4427,842,4427
"My feelings are in limbo over a girl I feel I can't or at least shouldn't date. So I 22M am feeling frustrated, I'm in a situation where a girl (17) started to show some interest towards me and unexpectedly I've started to catch feelings which I did not expect nor had any intention of doing so.

**(Just to make things clear the legal consenting age in my country is 16 however people can and do feel strongly around this topic both irl and on reddit and so I made it on a throw away account, and to be clear nothing has happened between me and this girl anyways).**

I meet this girl through a mutual hobby. A few months ago I started to see this one girl around the gym about one month into us seeing each other around the gym (we do a combat sport) she started to come up to me and ask if I wanted to partner up with her during training. When I first started seeing her I honestly didn't think much of her at all, to me she was just another person that I would see at training. But once we started to partner up and get comfortable with each other I unexpectedly started to see her in a different way and she started to grow on me and I can't help but feel some kind of way towards her. Every time we train together we're always having a laugh and I genuinely enjoy her presence despite her being far more experienced than I am and often times she shows me up and I be looking like a absolute beginner around her its still fun.

I don't really know what to do because I've been single all my life and recently I've gotten my life together and in the past I didn't ever get any attention from woman and only recently I've been getting some attention from some woman but this girl is the first girl within the last 6 months where a girl has been interested in me and I've had some interest in her back, but of course there's a catch and it's her age.

I feel much more confident and sure of myself and as a result I feel I'm in a position where I would be confident and comfortable with actively pursuing asking for a number and setting a date up with someone that I know has some interest in me but I don't feel comfortable with doing such with this girl due to her age and I'm not sure what the reception would be like from those around me. And so here is where I feel frustrated because I have feelings and I see her and interact with her often but I can't do anything I can't pursue her I can't get her socials or ask out because I don't think it's a good idea and so my feelings are in limbo and what screws with me even more is that there's a degree of hope. This hope comes from the fact that I really enjoy the hobby and the training that I do and I'm sure I'm going to see her long into the future (she's really into it too) and so maybe when she's older there's a chance.

But for now I'm just gonna have to be mature and have my feelings for her remain hidden in limbo and just be training friends and not flirt or make any advances towards her, which fucking sucks. I feel worse too because I struggle with dating and I don't get many opportunities and I do have the thought of ""what if I don't find no one"".  


TLDR;   
A girl likes me and I've started to like her back but she's 17 and I'm 22M and now I feel as if I cant do anything with theses feeling and I'm just gonna have to be friends and nothing more but it sucks because I don't get these feelings often and almost is never mutual. And so its like what am I meant to do with theses feelings I see her all the time and I don't think its a good idea to even think of perusing.",__-Anonymous-_,0,1690802663.0,0.5,3550,706,3550
"Overwhelmed in online dating Hi all,

Im back to the dating market and somehowe i feel overwhelmed because of the many choices online.

The idea that you have easy acces to potential partners makes it harder to have a choice, i feel like this choice paradox will be pushing 
you to keep chasing for the next best thing.
And the pressure to make the right choice is not making the process easier.

"8 Red Flags to notice and consider when dating someone seriously. This is based on a recent experience I had (31 y old male) while dating an older woman. These are 8 things to watch out for because they could prevent long term longevity.

1) Controlling 

Seeks to rule with a presiding authority over how your time is spent, and who you are allowed to associate with. Devalues your social circle in attempt to create codependency based isolation. Wants to shape your life into a submissive role that supports their own world, and their own goals while marginalizing your personal ones. Wants your behavior to be reflective of what they say is or isn‚Äôt acceptable, any violation of which could result in consequential punishment. 


2) Manipulative 

Utilizes coercive tactics to enforce their desired end results, including punishment/reward mechanisms. Instead of compassion and respect being given freely out of love, any attention or admiration must strictly be earned through adherence to the rules they set. Time of your own is largely nonexistent. You have to always be available when they need you for something or when they feel ‚Äòlonely‚Äô.


3) Overly Critical and judgmental 

The past is never the past, and instead of seeing the best in your potential, they will frequently bring up your previous mistakes to devalue you, criticize you, or make you have feelings of shame and regret. You apologize more than once for problems that you are wanting to move on from. They can‚Äôt let go of their resentment towards you. You may even be extremely accepting of things they did wrong while they are the complete opposite towards you.


4) Avoids admitting fault or accepting blame 

They avoid accountability 90% of the time. Sometimes they deflect from their actions by blaming you. Also known as blame shifting. You stop bringing up things you disagree with because you know it will likely never be resolved. You are never allowed to win an argument and they rarely if ever apologize for any of their own behaviors.


5) Lack of empathy 

When you are experiencing a difficult time in your life, they have no empathy for you. They accuse you of playing the victim. Instead of expressing care and concern, they tell you that you are weak or they make comments to disregard your thoughts and feelings. They don‚Äôt want to understand what you‚Äôre going through. You‚Äôre supposed to be happy and joyful in all circumstances. Their version of ‚Äúcheering you up‚Äù is typically unsupportive and mediocre.


6) Lack of intimacy 

They don‚Äôt show you affection often, and will stop you from initiating most physical interactions. You have to earn their affection and only on days when they aren‚Äôt too tired will they kiss you, or touch you. Leaving you feeling undesirable, or that this person doesn‚Äôt actually like you as a person. If there is an imbalance in this dynamic, it will lead to other problems in the relationship.


7) Temperamental 

Easily loses their temper at the slightest turn of events. Reactive to outside pressure with intensity that may result in being yelled at, or punished and berated. If they don‚Äôt get their way, someone has got to pay. Vengeful and cunning. 

8) Lazy, unmotivated 

They only have the energy to perform tasks that serve them and very little if any time to entertain your own ideas of a good time or how a day should be spent. They prefer to be lazy when it comes to things that you want to do. Your schedule revolves around their plans. You get used to not having any free time.


If you have any additional ones, let me know below. If you‚Äôre successfully or not in a relationship that has any of these dynamics I‚Äôd be curious to hear about your experiences.",zwolfe13,0,1690762741.0,0.5,3695,632,3695

some of my concerns/questions are

at what point do i mention i haven‚Äôt dated before? and how do i know that his reaction is normal or a red flag?

"He was the perpetrator: How does he want to heal? Why do I cause him pain now? I genuinely want to understand. Last year, a guy friend (32M) was very unhappy in his unhealthy, on-and-off 5-year relationship with his girlfriend and approached me (28W) with romantic intentions. I eventually reciprocated his feelings, and we ended up falling deeply in love and thought of each other as ""the one."" But after a year of drama, indecisiveness, and entering and re-entering a toxic cycle with me, he eventually chose to stay with his girlfriend despite wanting to leave her multiple times. 

I believe they're in a codependent relationship and both of them are codependent individuals. His parents, friends, and I think his girlfriend is terrible, and he acknowledges our concerns, but what can we do at this point. 

We just ended our friendship/connection for good until we've both ""healed"" and ""moved on"" and agreed to reach out in 2 years if the conditions are right to see if friendship is possible.

**Since he called himself the perpetrator of this entire mess, I'm genuinely trying to understand:**

1. **What does he mean when he says he needs the time and space to ""heal""?**
2. **Why do I cause him pain now?**
3. This past year was painful for both of us, and he doesn't want to go through another year of hurting and being hurt. **How exactly is he being hurt?**

He didn't go into any details, so I'd appreciate hearing what you all think.

Feedback on Approach - I feel shame for wanting sex early on. Hello everyone! My dilemma is that I used to date someone and be friendly and then usually wait till the 3rd date to push for sex. Then I started to realize that if sex isn‚Äôt communicated early on you could get stuck w women who want to wait till marriage. So now I am pretty straight forward with women and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs being received or if I am being creepy? Is it ok to just want sex? I feel kind of weird being that way.

"What can I do to improve my dating life? Hello. I am a 20-year-old straight guy who's super frustrated with my dating life. It feels like every time I am interested in or find a girl attractive I either get rejected or get led on. I wholeheartedly believe that I am attractive and have been told by many of my friends (guys and girls) for the past couple of years that I am handsome, smart, funny, and overall a catch, but it just doesn't seem that the girls I am interested in ever give me the time of day. FWIW, I am just over 6 feet tall, have straight white teeth (never needed braces or anything), have clear skin (I literally have been doing a 15-minute skincare routine every single night before going to bed since I was 18), and I also believe that I am generally a sociable person. I have very good hygiene and have been told many times by several of my friends and family that I smell good and dress well. I have been working out a TON over the last couple of years trying to level up and have put on a good amount of muscle compared to when I was 17. Working out has significantly improved my mental health and self-worth, but it just sucks knowing in the back of my head that I'm so frustrated with my dating life and that I am always lonely. It feels like I am never enough.  
The thing that is frustrating is that literally every time I see and approach a cute girl I always get the same old ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""Sorry, I'm not looking for that right now"". It's especially sad and makes me miserable because I've been rejected so many times that 95 % of the time when I hear something like this nowadays I can see straight thru the BS in the sense that these women are just trying to let me off easy by making up an excuse. I feel that I am very selective in the girls that I approach (I make sure that they seem single I know that you can't always tell if you just see a girl in public, but I've gotten good at figuring it out for the most part and I also try to make eye contact prior to approaching them), but I am still shooting my shot a lot so it's not like the sample size is small. For reference, this month (July 2023) I can literally think of 27 different girls that I have cold approached and only gotten 2 numbers from those interactions. And those two numbers led to me just being ghosted right off the bat (no response to my first ""Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from \[where we met\]"" text). It's just overly frustrating going through this never-ending cycle and just thinking about it makes me feel miserable. I'll use my latest cold approach as an example. I saw a super attractive girl at my gym yesterday, so I made eye contact with her briefly when I first saw her. Then, later on in my workout I went to the water fountain and was passing by her (we were walking past each other) and I pulled out my earbuds and struck up a quick conversation with her. The conversation was fine nothing out of the ordinary just basic gym small talk, and I maintained eye contact the entire time. After about 45 seconds of chatting, I said something along the lines of, ""Well, I've gotta head out soon it was nice talking to you. I'd like to get to know you better, may I get your number?"" To which she hit me with the dreadful, ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend."" I am basically positive that this girl is single. Also, there was nothing in the conversation that could have shown me that she was not interested. She was making eye contact the entire time. Her body language was more open and facing toward me (all the Youtube videos I've watched aimlessly hoping to fix my dating life have always talked about this), and she asked me a question or two in the conversation which I thought maybe meant she was at least interested in getting to know me at the very least. I guess she was just being friendly. I go into these approaches feeling confident almost like the mentality that ""this girl would be honored to have a piece of this"", but it just doesn't seem to make a difference in the outcome. By the way, the confidence isn't faked. I have genuinely been feeling very confident and comfortable in my skin, especially over the past few years. However, it just eats at me on the inside that I am lonely and not able to secure a date with a girl that I find attractive. Literally, all I want is a chance to get to know and take a girl I find attractive out on a date.  
One thing I haven't mentioned yet that's always been in the back of my mind is that I am of Indian descent. I was born, raised, and currently live in the United States. The girls I am interested in the most part are white girls and maybe some Latinas here and there. I don't know why, but those are really the only girls that I find attractive. Does this have anything to do with my experiences? I feel that anytime I flirt with an Indian girl they are almost always interested, but I can't ever seem to get that level of interest in the girls I am attracted to (white girls). Is there anything I can do about this? I've been constantly told by my white friends (guys and girls) that my race doesn't matter and that girls don't really care, but it's really hard for me to believe that with my experiences. I just feel miserable especially because I always see shorter, less attractive white guys having no problem in dating the girls I find attractive.  
Several months ago, my family and I went to the west coast for vacation (Arizona area), and I was getting significantly more matches with girls I found attractive than I ever had back home. Is it maybe where I live that could be the problem? Maybe these white girls I'm approaching all the time have some racism instilled in them still. Is that what's up? I always thought being in the 21st century that racism would be a thing of the past. Is that really the case though?  
I can anticipate all of the comments saying that I may be coming off as too desperate and needy, but I can guarantee you that is not the case. I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, this guy is just not self-aware."" I promise you that I am not putting a relationship on a pedestal. In fact, my goal for my twenties is to level myself up and build my career. However, I am still extremely frustrated with my results in the sense that I want to improve my game so that I can someday have what I desire. It's just really messing with my head, and I need an outsider's perspective on how to fix it.  
I am not expecting you all to solve my dating woes, but I would really appreciate any feedback you all have for me. I have decided that I am going to continue leveling myself up in the gym, career-wise, etc. in the meantime, but at the end of the day, I would really love to find someone that I am attracted to share it all with.  
Sorry for the super long write up guys, but I just really wanted to give you all a good understanding of how I am feeling and what's been going through my mind. Thanks in advance for the feedback.",Original_Payment_655,0,1690352030.0,0.33,6947,1323,6947

He said no and hung up in my face because that made him upset then proceeded to think I‚Äôd want to still have sex with him . He called me weird and cringe for laughing and being my awkward self . I have anxiety and I‚Äôm anxious. Since I do that he tried to say it had something to do with maturity. Of course I‚Äôll awkwardly laugh if you‚Äôre ignoring me and I‚Äôm awkward anyways .

"Am I the asshole? I cheated on my boyfriend and we got back together. My boyfriend, james, and I have been dating a little over a year now. So to explain the situation, I have been doing substances such as marijuana and alcohol for many years, I do it to relieve stress and it‚Äôs become a habit for when I‚Äôm upset, or just anytime I crave it. My boyfriend is a religious guy, and is extremely against the use of these substances. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even consider them human‚Äù-James
When my boyfriend and I met, I knew straight away that I liked him and he knew straight away that he loved me, I chose to attempt to quit alcohol and marijuana for him to keep us together. 
Although, I quit the substances for a month, and I ended up doing the substances without his knowledge for the next 2 months. I continued to lie to him and tell him that I was not doing it in order to save our relationship, because if he knew he would break up with me. Though a big part of this lie was because I was struggling very much and I felt that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand where I was coming from if I did start these substances again, we never hangout, we basically have a long distance relationship because of his strict parents, so I didn‚Äôt have the full support I needed to get past my issue. my sister had died and I was the one to preform CPR on her, then my dad abandoned me leaving me with my grandmother is what caused me to start again.  
After a rough argument with James, I decided to go to a party with my friends without his knowledge. At this party I got blackout drunk and kissed another girl in a game of spin the bottle(I am a straight female), somebody at the party recorded the video and sent it to James. I apologized profusely, and I still do till this very  day, and I feel so horrible for it. The next day he broke up with me and I had a seizure, the next Monday I went to school and brought weed and got suspended, then I moved out of the town to live with my mom. 

We talked everyday for 3 weeks and then decided to get Back together, the reason he got back with me was because he still loved me and he didn‚Äôt want me to attempt suicide again, start marijuana and alcohol, and because of my seizure. I feel that this whole situation has helped our relationship grow so much now, we are both completely open with each other, and I actually have quit the substances now. 

Though, throughout our whole entire relationship I‚Äôve been suspicious of one girl in his friends group, Amy(he used to like her and they are around each other more than him and I were, plus she looked exactly like me). James would tell me every little interaction that they had, it was obvious flirting but he continued to deny that he liked her.
Months after James and I started to date again, we were texting all night, then suddenly Amy texted him and asked James to come over and cuddle and stuff. James left our conversation to go talk with her, during their talk he called me because I was angry and said I was going to sleep, but he continued to text her. I then hung up the phone to see how long it took him to choose me. After a good 30 minutes, he texted me having a panic attack, so I called him to make sure he was safe and okay, he told me that they had both confessed their feelings to each other, and told me that he did like Amy too. He asked me if I wanted him to block Amy, I said it was his choice who he really wants here so it was up for him to decide that, 2 days later he blocked her.

"Can‚Äôt keep a girl‚Äôs interest My whole life ode struggled with anxiety and the fear of talking to girls. As I‚Äôm sure lots of guys have. In my 20‚Äôs now, and while I‚Äôve had fun here and there, anytime it comes to a relationship I just feel like no one I‚Äôve been into hasn‚Äôt been into me. Even girls that I do date, always brake it off after no more than a few weeks. Months if I‚Äôm lucky. 

Fast forward to now, this girl I was just recently seeing is amazing and I wanted a relationship but before I even told her how I felt she told me she wants to be just friends. Anyways, any time we hung out and she talks about her past flings or boyfriends and they all seem like biggest assholes.  She‚Äôd tell me stories about how they mainly force their ways into relationships and other ‚Äúactivities‚Äù. For example she told about this one guy who sounded awful for the way he treated her, but then when she talks about them being romantic or how he‚Äôd just kiss her without asking or start doing sexual stuff without really asking because they think it‚Äôs romantic or attractive that the man is taking what he wants and ect. 

It just upsets me bc I feel like that‚Äôs what girls want.  I don‚Äôt want to believe the stigma around the whole ‚Äúgirls love assholes‚Äù thing bc that‚Äôs just not who I am. I can‚Äôt just start making out with a girl if she‚Äôs crying bc my anxiety and consideration for others always stops me from doing stuff like that. I just feel like they always go back to these kinds of guys. They just lose interest in me. Anyways, I felt like I pushed her away because Im not like those kinds of guys.

"Me M27 and gf, 25 recently broke up after 5 years and just had out first communication via text since the split looking for opinions on how to gauge where we stand and the next best steps. (LONG READ) Background:
Met in college, since grad We've been primarily semi long distance due to careers. But regularly see each other 2-3 times a month and rarely if ever have serious arguments/ issues. Ended things based off of saying she felt like she was holding me back and still has things she wants to achieve independently like living alone and buying her own house. (She currently shares apartment with another girl, and I am a home owner) I have a established well paying job and shes working through an internship. None of this bothers me. throughout our relationship it has been a point of contention that she doesn't view the things I have as hers. I always emphasized how I want to care for her want to build together and she's the girl I intend to marry. All sudden the feeling came too strong I guess and she called it off saying she needs to work on things alone. I obviously was kinda blindsided want to stay together and trying to fix things. Should I just let her be or is this worth fighting for?

Hey, as today closes out its a week
since we did this (feels way longer)
and ill be honest there were moments
i wanted to pick up and call. I miss you,
hearing your voice, just knowing your
safe. I still want to give you time you
need, and I know we agreed on two
months. there's a lot I want to say. But
I do appreciate the perspective that a
break can offer. I do know for sure that
I just need you to know that I love you
so much (her name), I want us to work and I
will do whatever I need to make this work. Our
relationship is one I really do think is
worth protecting. I hope you feel the
same way.

I really didn't intend to take this long
to respond. It's been an intense week
honestly. I miss you too. I miss having
someone to talk to it's been pretty
lonely. I don't think it's just that I miss
talking to you but you've definitely
made me think about it. I can't reiterate
enough how much I appreciate you
and all the things that you've done. I
care a lot about you but you know me
l'm always taking care of other people

"Why do Women Expect Commitment in this Day and Age? Been watching videos and shorts about women ranting that men are afraid of commitment. Hmmm.

So, we now live in a world where ghosting has become an accepted norm for people to end relationships. No matter the depth of that relationship. And women are the biggest users of this tactic by far. And women are more likely to break the relationship. And they are more likely to invoke frivolous reasons (because Barbie??). And now men are being coached, by women, to just move on and get over it.

Well ok. But why do women expect boys and men growing up in a such a world to develop a sense of commitment toward them?",Emiel-Regis-RTG,0,1690815763.0,0.39,667,123,667
"Types of ‚ú®men‚ú® So we‚Äôve all heard of Schr√∂dingers cat right? That experiment? I think all of us studied about it when we were in school, no? 

But here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not JUST a cat. Confused? Let me give you an example using the world of ‚ú®dating‚ú®.

Now for those who are straight, Bi, gay or anything but a lesbian, Cis-het men is usually a category one comes across.
But in this category, there are various sub categories (kinda like the various voice modules in my head that are narrating what I‚Äôm writing, but that‚Äôs not really the point). Here are the sub categories:-

1. Fucboi - naam hi kaafi hai. Sab ko use karte  hai like baap ke Diya credit card. Who cares if the damage done is higher than the damn credit card bill? At least I have given myself some self care and confidence Na üëÄ. They will use anything and everything to get you hooked to them. And like a fresher who has just scored their first job at corporate they‚Äôre supremely adjustable depending on what they think will help them land their target. I say target because at this point we‚Äôre nothing more than a bulls eye for them. You hit the bulls eye, someone calls you daddy and then your inner Ariana Grande comes out screaming thank you next.
2. Case study : these are the men whom we talk about on group chats, with our best friends, when we catch up over drinks and then psychoanalyse the fuck out of them because daaru k baad toh bc hum hi Freud ka prot√©g√© hain. Now here‚Äôs the thing. These men could be the bestest creatures we‚Äôve ever known OR they‚Äôre the red flags üö© who inspire the commandments of the sisterhood. Does he only text you after or at exactly 2:00 am saying wyd or I miss you or u up? Behen he‚Äôs a laal jhanda. At that point other than his hormones and PP are the only things up. He‚Äôs going to go back to ignoring your existence and gaslighting you because if his loins are on fire then everything around him, including you, needs to be on fire. Does he send you a text apologising for the lack of responses because it‚Äôs been an overwhelming day and he wants to make it up to you by coming over with your favourite take away and watch your favourite movie? RUN STRAIGHT INTO HIS ARMS AND STAY THERE. &gt;insert pedro pascal‚Äôs voice&lt; he‚Äôs got you babygirl.
3.  Oedipus or Mumma ka sher: door se Bohut hard. MC Sher ko bhi kha jayenge. Bhagwan Kaun? Apun hi Bhagwan hai. BUT MUMMA KI PHONE AAYI TOH PHATA HUA BALLOON KA TARAH SAB HAWA GAAND SE NIKAL JATA HAI. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs not married to his mother. You think his Desire to be squeezved between your boobs is because he‚Äôs attracted to you but NO it‚Äôs actually because it reminds him of the times he‚Äôs been breastfed by his mummaaaaaa.
4. Men written by women: these are the boys/men who genuinely understand the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù. They don‚Äôt boast about the fact that they LET you pick the restaurant. They don‚Äôt tell their friends that they LET you wear the clothes you wear. They‚Äôre the men who help you with your with the pleats of your saree, enthusiastically take part in skin care routines with you, aren‚Äôt afraid of being vulnerable around you. They‚Äôre the kind who normalise being called a feminists, they use their privilege to call out locker room talk, they don‚Äôt tolerate that shit. They remember your favourite coffee order or pastry or kfc order and the likes. And boiiiiiiii can I tell you is that a turn on. Like respectfully Sir, you have permission to rearrange my biological being with junior. Thank you very very much. No, honestly it would be my HONOUR TO BE REARRANGED LIKE THAT.

And FINALLY the best for last.

5. ‚ú®Schr√∂dingers Chutiya‚ú® : they‚Äôre dangerous. Not the you need to get a restraining order dangerous. But the ‚Äúmake you fall for me and now you‚Äôre unconsciously rearranging your life around me but imma still not date you‚Äù dangerous. If there were a traffic signal, you‚Äôd see all the damn lights on. They love living in plausible deniability. It‚Äôs always 5 steps forward and then ten steps back. One minute you‚Äôre all consumed with their love and üå∂Ô∏è spicyüå∂Ô∏è talk, the next minute y‚Äôall are still talking but the love ain‚Äôt the same they get weird if you bring it up. And the thing is no matter how many times you tell yourself no more, they know EXACTLY how to wiggle their way back in. They don‚Äôt come to get their dick sucked or stroked. They‚Äôre here just for the way you fawning over them makes them feel. Who needs to buy a gaslighter or match box to put your stove on when these fuckers exist? And whenever you ask then for clarity, they‚Äôre always lost and can surprisingly never remember what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it that way babe‚Äù oh really?

"The end of virtual love: online dating for half a year, but a liar Half a year ago, a boy named Jack added me as a fri

&amp;#x200B;

end on a social platform. We started chatting, and it all seemed wonderful. We have a lot in common and often talk for hours. Gradually, we care about each other and support each other. Jack is a person full of sunshine and positive energy, and I gradually began to rely on his existence.  
  
Over time, Jack told me he lived in a small town not too far from me. We decided to meet, and I went to the meeting place full of anticipation. However, when I arrived at my destination, I found that the world was not as beautiful as I expected.  
  
The boy Jack originally described was completely different, replaced by a ramshackle cabin. I started to feel flustered, but I went in resolutely. I found the room disorganized, with wine bottles everywhere and broken furniture. A dirty man appeared in front of me, he was not the gentle and caring Jack I expected.  
  
He smiled and said in broken language, ""Are you here to drive me away?"" I was uneasy, but still trying to understand the story in front of this man.  
  
He begins to tell about his past, a time when he was a wealthy businessman whose fortune gradually disappeared due to a series of unfortunate events. To a certain extent, he pinned his hopes on online fraud and was forced by life, but he also regretted what he had done. I immediately understood that this man was the Jack I knew. Although he was far from the image I expected, I still felt pity for him in my heart.  
  
Jack and I had a long chat that rainy afternoon. He honestly apologized to me, admitting that his false actions were motivated by feelings of desperation and deprivation. I can feel the deep remorse and self-blame in his heart.  
  
Even though Jack was more broken than he was before, I knew we had formed a special bond. I decided to forgive him and reach out to him when he needed help. I want him to find himself again, to rerealize his lost value from within.  
  
I worked with Jack through a long rebuilding phase, as he underwent career training, sought counseling, and worked to move beyond his past. We develop a whole new level of trust and understanding, sometimes even deeper than before.  
  
Virtual worlds are not always real, but real emotion can be found in these illusions too. Sometimes, people act falsely not only out of selfishness, but also out of inner emptiness and desperation. We should learn to be tolerant and understanding, so as to support others sincerely.  
  
It is not impossible for virtual love to become real, it just needs more tests and persistence. Of course, it does happen that you only meet after chatting online for half a year and find out that the other party is a liar, so it is also very important to be vigilant in online dating.

So he said ""just jerk me off, you need to learn how to do this"" and I said ""we should just wait until tomorrow, i want you to be horny for sex tomorrow."" And he was like ""no i want it now"", so I started...

But he wants it in a very specific way without lube so it was difficult to do without the lights on, just trying to do it by feeling how his hand moves and copying him. So eventually he just took over jerking off while feeling my body. But he went soft and was like ""let's just go to sleep, i'm too tired and you made it into a whole thing, i'm not feeling turned on anymore."" 

I thought he was trying to say i did something wrong, and when I asked - he said I didn't and that we are all good...but i don't know, I feel worried that I didn't perform well or that he is not satisfied. 

For some additional context, some other things that make me feel like this: 

\- he had to teach me how to do blowjobs in the beginning in the specific way that he likes, and it takes him like 15-20 mins to cum from it still 

\- it takes him like 5-10 mins to jerk off with porn, but takes him like 30-45 mins to cum from sex 

\- he calls me a pillow princess like half-jokingly (I definitely kind of am) but idk if he feels unsatisfied 

\- he is a lot more experienced than me, I've really only ever had long-term sex with 2 other people

Is this just normal in longer term relationships and I'm overthinking it or did I do something wrong? I'm freaking out.

"Urgent Help! Please The title is true‚Ä¶ I need urgent help. 

About me:
23M make 400+k. Ready to have a serious relationship. Muslim and religious. Want a girl whose covered since to me it signifies modesty and virginity. 




Introduction:
So I‚Äôm a  pretty good looking Muslim who used a Muslim dating app. 

Matches with this girl. I did great job flirting. She wanted me number. And even before I responded she tried calling on the app, which I didn‚Äôt answer because I was busy. 
She spammed me with messages. 
I gave it to her but told her a riddle for it. 

Immediately I get a text from
Montreal. I live in Toronto running a towing business and also have a location in Montreal‚Ä¶ I messaged her thinking she was a customer. 

She already starts flirting with me saying how she needs help because she‚Äôs stuck in the washer. 

Eventually we speak. Went well. Spoke for 4 hours. We both went for a virtual walk where I walk at a park and she does too. Was my idea. I like a lot about her. Her mom left her. My dad left me. It‚Äôs really weird but during the time her mom left her and my dad left me happened the same year. I kinda find that fascinating 


 Anyways She tells me she has to satisfy herrself every nightht before she goes to bed. That was the sexiest fucking thing ever. I started touching myself. Asked her what she liked. She told me. She asked me. I told her. I asked if she was playing with her self. She said yes. 
 But because I‚Äôm a devoted Muslim (and she is too). Sex after marriage. I told her if we‚Äôre getting married I can continue. She said she needed time
Because she just got out of a relationship. (I know I made a mistake there coming off like I‚Äôm in love with her after meeting her (but I am)). Before we went to bed she said she was spank me if I‚Äôm talking to other girls 

The next day went well‚Ä¶ she texted me. I texted back later on. She then called me while she‚Äôs at work. Told me she‚Äôs having a problem with her boss. She said her boss said she could take the day off. She went to ask him. And he said no I said if you want to quit you should. He was very rude. I told her to quit. She did‚Ä¶ afterwards I told her how she can help me find leads and I‚Äôd give her $100 or so‚Ä¶ again I think another mistake‚Ä¶ I told her we can focus on her potentially working for me as opposed to being sad about quitting. She said she wanted to talk to her sister. I kept saying not to because she will make the situation bigger than it seems. 


Anyways‚Ä¶. Problems start. I told her how everything will be ok etc. she didn‚Äôt respond. I texted her the next day saying let me know because I feel liable. Which is true‚Ä¶ maybe her sister told her it‚Äôs my fault and stuff. Still no respond. Following day I sent her screen shot of a Turkish girl I was FaceTiming with to get her attention and a voice note (forgot to say that all we‚Äôve ever sent each other was voice notes I‚Äôm typing to fast because I‚Äôm mad)


She fucking calls me at 1:30am when she hears it‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt answer. She send two voice notes, 1 minute each. Where she pretty much says we can get to know each other and how she got out of a talking stage‚Ä¶

Anyways‚Ä¶ we spoke that day FaceTimed I showed my self where she didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt ask her too especially if she didn‚Äôt want too. The same day she sends me voice messages about how her aunt is getting divorced and it‚Äôs making her so upset. 

We kept talking and shit via voice memos. I texted saying that I‚Äôm promise they're not gonna divorce. Yesterday I replied to my text ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not gonna divorce‚Äù with an I right or am I right?  No response. 

Today this morning I sent a voice memo being flirty. 


Honestly‚Ä¶ I think I was to availble for her and responded to fast. But my fucking job relies on answering my phone and driving around. If I am not on my phone I lose money. 


Idk if I should just give up‚Ä¶. I want her to obsess over me.",Aggravating-Tip-4242,0,1690434778.0,0.33,3869,751,3869

"I'm thinking of pathetically asking her out for the third time. Even made this little script. Please suggest something The story is that I've had a solid crush on this girl since past 4years and I was not always in the city to approach her properly. She works at the bank I've got account in. I've already made my intentions clear before. but whenever I called, she never answered anything solid. Probably because she's always in a professional setting and it's her office number that is recorded. She pretends like nothing happened the last time I made it awkward and quickly avoids anything not related to banking.

I'm recently laid off from this 6month old job and I am back in the city. Before going I asked her out for a coffee and she said that she is super busy this whole month.

After coming back last week I called and informed her that I've been laid off and will be in the city before finding anything new. I asked for a coffee again, she said she'll let me know.

Today I'm thinking of calling her for final to either start or get done with this finally. I prepared this loose script I'll modify on the go.

**I understand she's not very interested but she never replied ""maybe"" or ""never"" or hung up on me. She just giggles a little while responding. please read and tell me if I still have a chance.**

""Hi, you told me you'll let me know...

Actually I called to inform that my boss just finally settled my dues and they even gifted me movie coupons for two. They're valid for just 15days.(this is actually true). I really wanna spend that with you. Please come.

You know I first saw you in 2019. You are still the cutest girl I've ever seen. But it's not just about your looks. You're really kind and you've handled really patiently whenever I blurted my nonsense. You're so beautiful, Any guy's circuits would fire talking to you. I've kept these emotions inside for 4years and now I realised I should come clear and direct. Make it real Or end it finally.

Just call me around 9 and say your ideas. If busy just say so and we can just have coffee and chat for a while. If you're not at all interested just say so, If you are already committed just say so. But just answer something girl...""",Little_Setting,0,1690626591.0,0.42,2211,409,2211

"How to navigate dating as a demisexual person? Hello, I (28F) am demisexual. I do feel sexual attraction to men, but only after a connection has been formed and I really like them. My first serious relationship was when I was about 21, and while he ended up being very toxic and I had to leave for my own wellbeing, it broke my heart because I was head over heels for him and enjoyed being with him in that way. My last relationship was about 3 years ago and it was awful, I did not like him much at all and had to fake everything (I was very mentally ill and he was not a good boyfriend.) Since then, I've done a lot of work on myself and while I do not plan to go out and start trying to find a partner tomorrow, it is my goal to start trying again in a few months time.  


My question is, how do I explain this to people in a dating situation? I did not realize I was demisexual the last time I was on dating apps, but now I do. ""Hello, I do not want sex and will probably not want it for an undetermined amount of time unless I really end up liking you""...I just feel like there will be lots of guys who do not understand, do not believe me, or ignore that.

"Dating and body sex I‚Äôm [27F] and due to the situation and experience I had pass through, will love to share some wonderful advices and we can also communicate privately!!

Your clothes are off. Hands are exploring, mouths are heading south. Penetration is inevitable if it has happened already. But it seems too quiet? Should you talk during sex? Absolutely, and here are some great ideas.

These things to say during sex help your man keep up his stamina and excitement. Like telling him how it feels, encouraging him is positive reinforcement. It might also be crucial because women so frequently need extended clitoral stimulation in a specific manner.

Fuck me!
Right there.
Keep doing that.
Don‚Äôt stop.

Of course, you can always let him know when you‚Äôre about to orgasm. This helps him do whatever it is that‚Äôs going to set you over the edge. And it‚Äôs pretty hot to hear!

I told him that I too had an apartment of my own there so I wouldn't be staying at their place. He was fine with it and invited me to go to the beach with them and said we could all ride in his car, I told him i already have a ride and cant go into random dude's cars, he said they totally respect that and it was just casual convo until he asked me how much would i rate him 1-10. That was random but it kinda started getting sexual which I wasn't comfy with, he laughed and said its okay and that my boundries were great. He asked me to meet up today just to meet each other since we are going to the festival which is in 3 days, and i said sure, he then was like ""this is my first date with a ginger girl"" and i corrected him saying we're just hanging out to meet each other before going to a festival, he was like yess you are right. It was a very flowy and good conversation and he never attempted to actually break my boundries, just tested what i was comfortable with.

I respect people's space and I am not a pushy person whatsoever, but I sent him a ""hey, we going tonight?"" to which i didnt get a reply to.

But he pressured me into unprotected sex...which we did but I ended things shortly because of that...that he disrespected my boundary. Then I went back to my app and just a few days later matched with somone really great and hit it off he said he lowkey wanted to marry me he was obsessed with me. I told him I had unprotected sex recently with the perosn before him and have to get tested for sti's as I dont want to pass anything on to him because I care about him alot....before we meet. And he just unmatched me? I don't understand isnt it standard to just get tested before a new realtionship? Maybe I trauma dumped about the old guy as he abused me in more than one way and we ended things days before this new guy so all of it is fresh...as I struggling to cope. Maybe that's the reason? I guess you guys here couldnt tell without screenshots of the convo.....but I'm just wondering is it bad to tell somome you had unprotected sex or sex of any kind recently and may have been exposed and want to be tested first? Isnt that the responsible thing to do?,spoiledcandy,0,1690431797.0,0.4,1224,233,1224
"I've never been on a date, and I keep trying but not get anywhere. I'm 28M, and I can't find anyone to date. I tried online dating for 6 months. ZERO DATES

I tried physically going out to talk to people to meet women. That's too slow for me, I want a date by the end of the week. That is the goal and is not an option. I have $500 for anyone who wants to hang out with me under the condition that we will go out with each other once a week for 6 weeks. I'm not here to pay for sex. At this point, paying for it is the only goal to do it. 

But, I haven't gotten myself to advertise it. I'm not sure if there's any laws about paying people to date. I'm just confused about whether I should advertise this over Craigslist or not. How should I go about advertising my paid date?

"23 F in a 7 yr relationship Me and my boyfriend have been together from school. We broke up once but got back after almost 2 years. Things were normal and very sugary in the beginning of our second term but as the final years of our college approached we started having more arguments and couldnt give each other time much. My college got over 3 month before him so obviously i was free and needed more attention ahich again led to arguments because his semester wasnt over yet. We somehow managed that as well. But now both of us are free and since i am preparing for exams im not free the whole day except early morning (not that early, 9 to 10) i expect him to talk to me during that time but he wakes up very late and is almost absent the whole day on any social media and then texts me at night when im not free.  
  
IK I can be considerate here as he says its the only free time he will get before his joining but i never stopped him from sleeping. i just asked him to adjust his timings a bit. So when i said about this to him he started saying its not a big deal to take out 10 mins for him in the afternoon for him. But my point is when we can comfortablt have a 30 min to one hour conversation then why settle for 10.  
  
Also this year i planned out his birthday. Decorating room and surprise gifts with his favourite Waffle cake (it might not be a big deal but it was very special for me as it was the first time we would be together after celebrating all those ldr birthdays at junior college and at home during Covid). But when it was my birthday he didnt do anything except posting a story on instagram. I agree he was very much under stress due to his semester and exams but its been a month since then and even now he hasnt done a single thing for me. Not even a peice of chocolate. And when i say this to him he either laughs it off, or says he has planned something very big which he will do soon or im just not understanding enough to understand how his situation was during my birthday and all of this plus me being at home added more to his restraints so im being insensitive talking about this again and again.  
  
Am I expecting too much? What should I do. I feel like his efforts are gradually diminishing and whenever confronted he asks me to speak for myself. Im very disturbed due to all of this. Pls suggest something people.",oversleeping-,0,1690626544.0,0.33,2363,460,2363
"First time in the dating scene and I‚Äôm interested in 3 guys at once including my ex and I‚Äôm a wreck HELP. (VERY LONG) Im 21 (F) and this guy, I‚Äôll call him Jeff is 23 (M). We met at work back in April when I first started at Amazon when I was having a panic attack trying to learn how to operate the fork lift and my trainer had to grab another trainer which was Jeff, because I was doing so bad. Anyways right when we made eye contact I felt so much tension and connection with him immediately that it was ridiculous. I just chalked it out to him just doing this with everybody because to be honest he‚Äôs the most hottest guy at the warehouse. I was also in a 2 year relationship at the time that I was planning to end, but I still held my ground and remained loyal. After Jeff trained me I couldn‚Äôt get over him, I was looking for him EVERYWHERE. and everytime i did find him, he was already looking at me, and even approached me to have a random conversation and walked away hinting that he only walked in the area to speak to me. At this point I became Joe Goldberg from ‚ÄúYou‚Äù and needed to find out his last name in order to find his social media. After hours of looking, I found him and BOOM, he was in a relationship too. I felt like this was gods way of testing me. I followed Jeff, Jeff followed me back, and no further moves were made and I‚Äôm Night Shift and Jeff changed to day shift so I stopped seeing him ever since. eventually I did break up with my boyfriend (not because of Jeff) but because of how toxic we were, I fell out of love and felt like I mourned about the ending of our relationship for a very long time he cheated in the beginning and I never got over it and spent the whole relationship letting it eat me up inside and I became toxic as a whole myself. I‚Äôve been feeling guilty about breaking up with my ex ever since because until this day he is still begging for me back. I know I know a 2 year relationship I should spend time to heal right? Nope, met someone else at Amazon, we‚Äôll call him Stan 23 (M) we connected, I began to really like him and been hooking up for months. Stan was infatuated with me while I was in a relationship and I continusly rejected him and when I became single I decided to see what Stan was about. good guy, but immature. doesn‚Äôt want to take me seriously because hes too insecure about the amount of attention I get at work that he feels if he did pursue me I would break his heart. so for this, he treats me shitty but I couldn‚Äôt help but fall for Stan bc I‚Äôm not shit and always attracted to guys who play hard to get. Stan revealed to me recently that I was the second person he‚Äôs slept with, I could tell he has severe trust issues and been hurt which I can‚Äôt help but understand where he‚Äôs coming from in how he treats me. He sucks at texting me back and communicating and for this, it makes me become clingy and emotional. His reasoning for not texting back is because we always talk at work anyway. Problem with Stan, is we been talking for 3 months and Stan has never asked me out on a real date, he only did once when I was in a relationship and i rejected. when I brought this up to him he says he refuses to ask me out on a date because i rejected him in the beginning and i shouldn‚Äôt expect him to give me the same energy just because i broke up with my boyfriend. he also says he‚Äôs only off on Sundays and uses that day as his rest day but will also be quick to get a day off to hang with friends. he told me once that he doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with me more because he has feelings for me but is scared to proceed further. I‚Äôve always tried to initiate us to hangout (which I‚Äôve never done to a guy) and got rejected all 3 times I asked, and rejected by just being ignored or being told he had plans. He proceeds to accuse me of talking and seeing other guys all while trying to kiss and see me on my breaks still to chat. we talk more than we hook up by the way so I don‚Äôt think us hooking up did damage. Basically this whole thing became a situationship, in which I feared. I really like Stan, but this week I seen Jeff‚Äôs social media and noticed he was single, he began interacting with my post and I slid in his dms starting a conversation about his photography, he ended up giving me his phone number randomly and INSTANTLY asked me on a date to the movies and a restaurant. he was already doing more than Stan. Me and Jeff went on this date yesterday and I know I‚Äôm young but I‚Äôve only been done wrong by boys/men most of the time, I‚Äôve always been the one begging and wondering why I‚Äôm not good enough. Jeff did everything for me that I only dreamt of that I felt like I was in a simulation. The date was great Jeff consistently spoke about how he couldn‚Äôt get over me right when he laid eyes on me, how bad he wanted to talk to me but held himself together since he was in a relationship. He said he never saw a woman and immediately felt like that she was the person he wanted to be with until he seen me, and proceeded to plan a second date with me. Since these two guys literally both work at Amazon I couldn‚Äôt help but decide to be honest with Jeff about Stan it was eating me alive the entire date. Jeff actually appreciated this, said it was a green flag that I felt comfortable telling him and told me that he could tell I felt bad about doing it and said he‚Äôs done things with people at work too and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been 3 months and he hasn‚Äôt taken you out. I had a 10 hour shift today and work in the morning and still made time for you and we just started chatting two days ago, just think about that. And I‚Äôm not telling you this in a ‚Äúi want you way‚Äù I‚Äôm telling you as if me and you were friends that If he wanted to make time for you he would have. You need to know your worth‚Äù I was expecting to get ghosted and called a slur. instead, I was given an eye opener. Jeff stated that he only wants me and has been sending cute lengthy messages since our date and literally wants to see me everyday. This dude is literally everything I wanted in a guy. I honestly thought people like Jeff don‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed by how nice he‚Äôs treating to the point I do feel like it‚Äôs too good to be true and that he‚Äôs love bombing me but to be honest I genuinely don‚Äôt think he is but I‚Äôm stuck between 3 different guys that I‚Äôm trying to convince myself bad things about each of them so I don‚Äôt make a decision I regret. this is super unlike me as I am very much a lover girl and not the type to entertain 3 different guys at once so that might be why I feel a ton of guilt every single day I wake up and breath. My ex is all I‚Äôve ever known honestly which is the main source of my guilt of having to let him go and see him with someone else would ultimately crush me. but what im doing I know would crush him.

"My (19F) bf (22M) liked a tiktok video of a girl dancing provocatively right behind me Just like the title says, it's kind of wild to me how he did it. We were in his bedroom, he was sitting on his bed (behind me) scrolling on tiktok. I was busy putting away my stuff since I was going to sleep with him that night, and I heard the audio from the tiktok repeating from his phone. 

I'm quite familiar with the audio since I've seen girls posting their sexy dances with it, so I turned around to him and by this time he already scrolled away from it. I asked what video was he watching earlier, he hesitated so I scrolled up on his phone and I was right afterall. It was in fact a girl dancing sexily and guess what, he liked the tiktok. There goes the classic excuses of 'liking everything he sees' or the 'accidentally liked'.

I'm wondering if it really is a small matter since he asked me if I'm really mad over that small thing. But the more I think about how he literally liked the video while I was in the same room as him, right in front of his eyes, only facing away from him, the more miserable my mind gets.

That's not all, he lied about a lot of things after I went  through his phone (with permission since he told me his password confidently). And there's always nonsense explanation to each of it which I don't believe at all. Did I mention I found out that his Instagram is filled with girls that resembles his ex (a muslim) but only half naked on his homepage? There's like a hundred of them too. 

I'm starting to think I should leave since he and his family was pressuring me to get engaged with him while he's got all of these going on.

"Mein Freund erz√§hlt Dinge weiter, die nie passiert sind 


Ich wei√ü garnicht wo ich anfangen soll. Ich (18) bin mit meinen Freund (17) schon seit knapp 3 Jahren zusammen. In letzter Zeit ist er sehr komisch und desinteressiert mir gegen√ºber geworden, fr√ºher haben wir uns oft gestritten wenn ich mal einkaufen gehen wollte oder ich 10min zu sp√§t von der Arbeit kam. Selbst wenn ich mal etwas zu lange duschen oder auf zu Toilette wa wurde er sauer. Er hat mir absolut alles erz√§hlt, wa nie herablassend und wollte immer mit mir etwas machen. Er hat mich √ºberall zu seinen Freunden mit mitgenommen und ich habe die ersten 6 Monate der Beziehung niemanden treffen d√ºrfen au√üer ihn. Also es war wirklich extrem. 

Darum geht es aber nicht, ich habe wegen den st√§ndigen Streits und weil ich absolut nix machen darf mit ihm vor ca 4 Monaten Schluss gemacht. Er meinte er √§ndert sich und wir sind wieder zusammen gekommen.

Er hat sich ge√§ndert, innerhalb eines Monats war ich ihm komplett egal. Ich durfte nicht mehr mit zu seinen freunden, generell ist er mit mir nicht raus gegangen. Er hatte immerwieder  andere ausreden parat. Ich musste ihn jedes Mal 3-4 Stunden wort w√∂rtlich anbetteln und weinen dass er sich mit mir trifft, ihn mit Sex, bestelltem essen, Zigaretten oder Drogen locken, oder ihm drohen dass die Beziehung bald vorbei ist wenn das so weiter geht. Jetzt k√∂nnte man sagen, ja er hat einfach keine Lust mehr auf die Beziehung, aber immer wenn er gemerkt hat ich bin dabei Schluss zu machen schreibt er mir Paragrafen wie sehr er mich doch liebt und will dass ich vorbei komme, weint und verspricht mit mir die Tage auf ein Date gehen so wollen. Nur um mir dann am abgemachten Tag kurzfristig zu sagen er hat doch gerade kein Bock, bleibt bei seinen Freunden und dass ich aufh√∂ren soll zu heulen weil ihn das ja nervt. teilweise hat er mir VON SEINER HAUST√úR weg geschickt. 

Mit mir redet er nicht √ºber was ihn in der Beziehung st√∂rt und seine Freunde m√∂gen mich alle nicht weil er denen jedes mal eine komplett falsche Geschichte erz√§hlt, lieber mit denen redet. Ich dachte, er erz√§hlt die Dinge eben aus seiner Sicht.

Die Tage habe ich bei √ºbernachtet und ich wei√ü das ist nicht richtig, aber ich wa an deinem Handy. Ich hatte langsam das Gef√ºhl dass ein anderes m√§dchen der Grund f√ºr sein Verhalten ist, immer wenn ich es angesprochen habe wurde er sauer und hat sein Handy versteckt. Au√üerdem wollte ich schauen was er √ºber mich erz√§hlt und wie er sich f√ºhlt. Ich bin eine Person die nichts b√∂se nimmt, ich wollte wirklich nur mal seine Sicht verstehen. Andere Frauen habe ich nicht gefunden, aber sehr viele Chats mit meinem Namen. Er hat seinen Freunden erz√§hlt ich h√§tte ihn mehrmals Betrogen. Er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich habe ihn oft beleidigt und ich h√§tte ihn geschlagen. Er hat Bilder von blauen Flecken geschickt und meinte ich w√§re das gewesen. Einmal hat er sein Handy im Streit kaputt gemacht, er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich h√§tte es kaputt gemacht weil ich einen Chat mit seiner Schwester gefunden h√§tte und eifers√ºchtig gewesen w√§re. Ich wa davor noch nie an seinem Handy. Er meinte ich w√ºrde ihm verbieten feiern zu gehen, seine Freunde zu sehen und habe raus gefunden dass er sehr oft im Club wa oder nachts im Park feiern. Ich wei√ü nicht warum er das alles heimlich gemacht hat, ich habe ihm noch nie gesagt dass ich etwas dagegen habe und das habe ich auch nicht. Er hat sehr oft geschrieben ich h√§tte Schluss gemacht, w√§re mit Jungs drau√üen und betrunken. Fast allen seinen Freunden hat er am gleichen Tag geschrieben sie sollen mich auf insta blocken oder von der Story blocken. Er hat auch Freundinnen von sich geschrieben dass ich den Kontakt verbiete, welche die ich pers√∂nlich kenne und befreundet bin. Mir ist das so peinlich dass er so etwas behauptet. 

Ich habe auch Audios gefunden in denen er erz√§hlt er hat garkein Bock mehr auf mich und sich freut wenn die Beziehung vorbei ist weil er dann endlich wieder der Playboy sein k√∂nnte der er eigentlich ist und er nicht an die wahre Liebe glaubt. Das w√§re alles nur eine teenage Beziehung und die wahre Liebe kommt ja sp√§ter. 
Falls das seine ehrlich Meinung ist akzeptiere ich das nat√ºrlich, aber mir erz√§hlt und k√§mpft er eben f√ºr etwa komplett anderes und verachtet Leute mit dieser Meinung. 

Diese Dinge schreibt er erst seit dem er so extrem kalt (seit der Trennung) geworden ist, alles davor waren Texte in denen er sagt dass er mich liebt, sich freut mich zu sehen oder in denen er wirklich nach Rat wegen Streits fragt. 

Ich wei√ü nicht was das soll, absolut nichts davon ist wahr. Diese Sachen sind alle komplett ausgedacht. Was soll ich jetzt machen ? Ich kann ihm nicht sagen dass ich an seinem Handy war, er w√ºrde zurecht komplett ausrasten und das vertrauen w√§re kaputt. Bitte nicht blump ,,einfach Schluss machen‚Äú, wir verstehen uns eigentlich sehr gut und haben sehr sch√∂ne Momente zusammen, lachen und haben Spa√ü. Das Waren jetzt ausschlie√ülich die schlechten Dinge. 

Danke f√ºrs lesen vom langen Text, ich habe mir extra Reddit runtergeladen weil ich nicht weiter wei√ü üòÖ meinen Freunden k√∂nnte ich das nicht erz√§hlen.",drippy-goose,0,1690825298.0,0.33,5122,889,5122

We work together (different departments) so we still see each other. Although we were both away and havent seen each other or been in contact at all for the past 6 weeks. Radio silence. We actually had a long talk before the 6 weeks of no contact and I honestly thought we‚Äôre on ‚Äûnormal‚Äú, at least kinda amicable terms without any awkwardness.
Anyway, today we saw each other for the first time and he seems to try to avoid me like I‚Äòm the pest. And I honestly don‚Äôt get it. We were fine before the contact period and I expected ‚Äûnormal‚Äú behaviour at work. Like the colleagues we were. 
And now that? That kind of threw me today. Caught him staring at me from the distance once, but that‚Äôs it. He seemed normal with everyone else‚Ä¶
It kinda made me super uncomfortable, because I didn‚Äôt expect that today. Can anyone think of what I could have ‚Äûdone‚Äú to cause this sudden behaviour??",Ill_Letterhead9766,0,1690464697.0,0.5,1093,204,1093

"I'm autistic. I think I'm screwed when it comes to dating. I‚Äôm (29m) on the autism spectrum. I've never been kissed, dated, had sex, or been in a relationship with a woman. Recognizing social cues have never been my strong suit. I barely know what flirting is. I've been bullied all throughout my life because of my looks, mostly by women. I have friends but they're all married with kids and I'm the only one who is still single. It seems like my parents cursed me with my ugly looks and autism. I feel stuck because it seems like having autism is a death sentence especially if you're a man.

"Why do people hide promiscuity from dates? People hide things when they think they are wrong not when they think they are right. 

If the are confident in being promiscuous then they should find a mate with similar values. Why hide it from a person with different value system? Don't they want someone with shared values?

I get rejected because I voice my monogamous preferences, but that is fine because I want a monogamous partner too. So it is hard for me to understand people lying about the life they live(d).",que8rencia,0,1690405779.0,0.43,515,91,515
"Dumb question. How do I stop thinking about boys? [F20] I have a lot of hobbies and goals that occupy most of my time, and my social life is decent. How do I stop thinking so frequently about different boys I'm talking to online?  
  
They ask me out on dates, but it's not easy for me to go to their city (1h away) and they can't come to mine due to my circumstances. I'll start uni in September and I'll be moving even further away from their city. So probably we'll be able to see each other 1-2 times in August and then probably never again.  
  
We talk online and make calls (we're still getting to know each other). The problem is that during the night I'm thinking about the conversations and interactions we had during the day. Some nights I can't sleep at all.  
  
I can't control my thoughts about boys. I've been so comfortable being single for the past 2 years and I genuinly don't need a man, yet I wish for a partner and I crave masculine energy and intimacy in my life.

"Cold over text I (26M) started dating this girl (23F) a couple weeks ago. We had 3 dates until now and everything seems to work really well when we're in person. 

We have nice conversations, we're laughing and having a good time but when it comes with texting it feels like I talk with another person.

She would ask me how was work and then she wouldn't reply for hours or even the next day. She's really cold in texting, sometimes it's even hard to set a date. I also have to start most conversations as she would almost never start them.

"Beat avoidant attachment style Did anyone manage to beat avoidant attachment style. I've been in therapy and relisted Im an avoidant. This it helped me to improve and got more aware about my behavior. 

I'm really happy with my self. I'm in shape, have Alot of friends and Hobbys. I get a lot off compliments about my looks and personality. Also I have a decent career path usw.
Hope I didn't sound like I'm arrogante or overly prag the whole time about me 
Don't worry I know for girls personality and confidence matters the most. I don't wanna debate that :)
But still only attract  women I don't find attractive, usually looks wise or a lot older far away. Never seen to work with the one I like. I've been on so many dates. It's never mutual...
It feels like I always hurt girls or I get hurt :/

I'm pretty sure I have more confident around girls I'm not attracted to, cause I don't care about them in a romantic way. With women I like I always fucked it up,worry about anything I do. 
Probably I subconsciously behave weird around them, to not make it work cause of  fear of rejection.
Usually I get the advice to speak and date to more women I'm really into. 
But they always reject me, I feel like these countless rejections made me even more anxious around women I like. For example around them I often run out of  topics to speak about act unsure

Has anyone been in a similar situation and manage to fixe the problem?

"Is it weird that I‚Äôm uncomfortabel with my Bf en Bestfriend texting. So I‚Äôve been dating my Boyfriend for 4 Months now and he is the first guy I actually introduced to my friends. After dating for 2 months I thought it would be fun to invite my bestfriend to go out with us. They instantly clicked and there was no awkwardness whatsoever. My bestfriend is always someone who gets along fast with people, she is a really social and confident girl. Me on the contrary am really socialy anxious and not as confident as her. There been situations where I was interested in a boy but ended up finding out they liked her instead. I always tried my best not to get jealous of her but I‚Äôm still a human and things happen. But I do really love her she is such an amazing person and just like a sister to me. So anways I used her phone once to call my bf because my phone died, after that sometimes if I don‚Äôt answer my phone he would text her instead because we always togheter. But today I saw that they also have eachother on snap and also text there. Not a big deal ofcourse because I know my bestfriend and she would never do something to me but Its kind of weird knowing they are texting because I do know that my bf obviously thinks she is hot. All his friends already talked about how hot she is in front of me. I know that she is in his Private story but that really doesn‚Äôt matter because he only post meme‚Äôs, the thing I really hope is that he is not in her private story because she post alot of thirst traps on in it and really sexy pictures and it would be really weird if my boyfriend sees that. I wanted to ask her if he is in her private story but didn‚Äôt wanted to come across as suspicious towards her. I actually know for a fact if I would text his bestfriend on snap that he would freak out and say that Its really weird and all. I also know that if I would just tell my bestfriend I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the idea of them texting thats she would stop texting him and even delete him but I really don‚Äôt want to come of as this jealous controling girlriend because it‚Äôs not really like they‚Äôre texting in a flirty way its more joking about things and stuff like that.

"My Third Date - My Dating Experience on a Herpes Dating Site Let‚Äôs get to my third date. It was with this woman who I‚Äôd already known for quite a while. Though this woman was technically the third person I date from this platform, we had been communicating for quite some time before our in-person encounter. From our very first chat, there was a connection. Her life was firmly rooted in Florida, where she worked, and our virtual proximity allowed for a mutual exchange and understanding.  
  
We decided to spend an afternoon together. It started with us meeting at a local coffee shop where we filled hours with light-hearted conversations. I remember there was a certain ease to our meetup, a comfort level that only comes with familiarity.  
  
Post the coffee session, we headed for dinner. Shared meals always tend to bring people closer, and quite fittingly, we bonded over our mutual love for food.  
  
As the evening melted into the coolness of the night, we decided to go back to her place. It led us to an interesting turn of the night. She suggested sharing a bath together‚Äîan unusual but intriguing idea.  
  
And then came the moment that you might guess‚Äîa moment of closer physical intimacy, right in the bathtub, far away from the convention. But we went there, a decision meant for us and us alone. It didn‚Äôt stop there either, as we continued the scenario on her bed, weaving an experience of intimacy and connection that was unique yet familiar, a dialogue of affection expressed without words.  
  
Remember, this is less of a raunchy tale and more about the journey through a dating experience on a site that caters specifically to people with herpes. That shared understanding forms the backdrop of our interactions.  
  
So, there it was, my third date - a tapestry of fond memories, of connection built over coffee, food, amusing conversations, and mutual affection‚Äîall painted on a canvas of understanding and acceptance. This simple tale has less to do with the number in the series of dates and more with the exploration of companionship, acceptance, and shared experiences.",N111ko_for_dating,0,1690418361.0,0.25,2116,354,2116

"How do I break up with my boyfriend peacefully? I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 years, but I don‚Äôt feel anything for our relationship anymore. 

He‚Äôs becoming a bum to me and even though I‚Äôve tried everything to make our relationship spark again I just can‚Äôt. We started dating before COVID hit and when it did we didn‚Äôt have much to do, so I would accept going to his house often. A few months after we got together he got cancer and fought it for about a year, and because of that we couldn‚Äôt go out or do anything because he could‚Äôve gotten really sick and we just didn‚Äôt want to risk it. 

Well, fast forward to about a year ago he wasn‚Äôt working. His cancer wasn‚Äôt really bad (we caught it before it had a chance to take over) so his healing was quick. This is when I started to think about the future of our relationship. He was not doing anythingggg. He wasn‚Äôt working, wasn‚Äôt going to school (I was finishing up my bachelors at the time) he would be playing on his PlayStation, would go out with his friends late at night, buy expensive parts for his car, but didn‚Äôt have a single dollar whenever we went out, couldn‚Äôt even buy me a coffee or pick some flowers from down the block because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time or money for that‚Äù. 

I hate how he would use his cancer as an excuse and that ‚Äúhe was healing‚Äù I won‚Äôt lie, it did make me feel bad and felt like I was being to harsh, but in reality I was trying everything for us, I would drive, I would buy our food and outings, I would buy him stuff and it got to a point where I thought I should just date myself. 

Anyway, he finally got a part-time job, and signed up for community college. I graduated from college and am looking for a job in my career. I started to think about our future and to be honest I see nothing, but then I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish and maybe he‚Äôll change. 

Should I leave him? If I do, how do I tell him? He‚Äôs very dramatic and cries every time I mention a break or break up between us, which just makes me feel bad and say never mind, but I‚Äôm tired of this. Will he change? Or is this just all an act?",Randomself0395,0,1690622263.0,0.5,2107,414,2107

we are both working professionals honestly with master's degrees and similar work experiences, so really i was only ever going to talk about those commonalities and see if he wanted to connect, if not, cool, best of luck. i would never do something like ""HELLO I SAW YOU IN INTERNET, YOU GO ON DATE WITH ME?""

"My Second Date - About my Dating Experience on a Herpes Dating Site Navigating the dating scene with herpes is a challenge in it‚Äôs own right. Discrimination, stigma, and fear often overshadow the potential joys of a blossoming romance. That‚Äôs why hesitantly yet hopefully, I turned to a specialized venue - a herpes dating site. What unfolded next was to be my unique, unanticipated second date.  
  
The digital cupid struck its arrow, pairing me with a dare-devilish student, hailing from one of the local colleges. Her pictures portrayed a fiery femme fatale - the kind of woman who would never fade into a crowd: a bold and spicy six-foot-tall seductress. Our digital encounters soon translated into a physical meeting, a coffee date by her campus.  
  
We rendezvoused at a quaint cafe near her college, the excitement in the air almost palpitable. The casual catch-up started with discussions about how our lives evolved post our herpes diagnoses. Such deeply personal conversations acted as the much-needed ice-breaker, paving the path for a trust-filled bond with openness at its core.  
  
Subsequently, the conversation took an unexpected turn. We plunged into an intimate discussion around our favorite sexual positions. It was an uncensored, liberating dialogue, free from any judgement or hesitation.  
  
As daylight faded, we decided to extend our date into the evening. A local restaurant was our choice for a delicious dinner, full of laughs, shared secrets, and mutual understanding. The culmination of our date took place at a hotel, an oasis of discretion and intimacy where we felt comfortable exploring our desires.  
  
From the moment we crossed the threshold of the hotel room, our anticipation escalated. We couldn‚Äôt resist the magnetic pull between us any longer. An intense and long-lasting lovemaking session took up most of the night, immersing us in a blissful, exhaustive trance.",N111ko_for_dating,0,1690331543.0,0.43,1921,303,1921
"(30M) I've never been in a relationship, which also means I've never had a GF, and I've never been on a proper date. Has the ship sailed for me? I apologize in advance if this goes haywire, I don't know how to write what I want to write in proper fashion or if it's going to come out right. Having said that, here I go... So yeah, the title is the gist of what my love life is like. I blame no one but myself. I would say from the time of middle school up until the time the pandemic really started, no dates/kisses/relationships/sex, also it didn't help that (among other things) my teeth did not look good. And for the most part I was overweight. Before I started working for the first time at age 23, I was a nobody, just at home taking up space and not doing a whole lot of living. So how would I get my fix if you will if I couldn't have a gf or have sex? Porn. I know, smh. Heck, I would say I still struggle with porn and masturbation to this day. There was an improvement in my life around the time the pandemic started, I finished my Invisalign treatment after 1 1/2 years. But I found it ironic that I was ready to show off my new smile and then the mask mandate happened haha. But yeah, getting my teeth fixed was the most important thing that could have happened to me, it needed to happen. From there I think things improved slightly, at least I became a little bit more social, mainly with people from work. And then, the best thing that happened to me last year, I met my best friend (I'll call her Jennifer (not real name of course) at work. We got to know each other little by little, and to this day we are best friends. At some point, there were times (not many) where we were more than just friends, we kissed, cuddled, and of course had sex. Even with us doing that, we are, and will remain, best friends. The reason I bring that up is if it wasn't for her giving me those experiences than I would be here at 30 years old thinking to myself when is this this this and this going to happen. I could never repay her for what she did for me, she didn't have to do that, but she wanted to give me for the first time in my life a taste of what I want in my love life, when it comes to the physical stuff, the dating/relationship stuff is a whole other thing.

"My (25M) Ex gf (23F) of 2 years and several months moved on quick I devoted so much physical and emotional effort into making that relationship work. I held myself accountable for my actions at the very beginning of us dating when it was a bit rocky. Eventually I asked her to my girlfriend and I believe that our relationship flourished only temporarily after that. We were pretty solid up until nearly our 2 year mark when I found out that she had been doing things behind my back that was in the direction of cheating. All while I was attending school, working, enjoying hobbies, and focusing on the relationship, she began to become a stressful burden for me after a year and a half and the final incident was the last straw. I still remember very vividly the night when she told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you deal with me. I feel like I‚Äôm too much sometimes.‚Äù I feel like such a dummy for saying ‚Äúbecause I love you.‚Äù Yeah that was so bad. I did love her though. She knew it too. I asked her why she did the things she did and her only excuse was ‚ÄúI feel like we don‚Äôt do enough dates. I feel like you don‚Äôt take me serious enough.‚Äù I explained to her that I‚Äôve been trying my best and that we already had something planned that week after. Overall, I realized it was a terrible excuse for her to cover herself. During the last few months of our relationship, I believe my subconscious was telling me to evacuate that relationship because I felt no Peace but anxiety and worry. Finally I packed up and left our apartment when I realized things wouldn‚Äôt change. 

We have been broken up for 2 months now. I still think of her. Slowly feeling better. However, I don‚Äôt think I can date for a while now. I feel like I have to focus on other things and I‚Äôm not capable of loving intimately right now.

Finally ,the point. I have a good friend (we‚Äôll call him A) that has a gf (we‚Äôll call her B) that has her on social media. I asked B recently if she knows how my ex is doing and she basically said that shouldn‚Äôt matter to you anymore but she did move on pretty fast with someone else. It hurt so bad knowing that she moved on quickly when I still feel devastated about the break up. Not really emotionally devastated but I guess I‚Äôm

"Why do I lose interest, when they begin to show interest? I (19F) have never been in a serious relationship with a guy, but I have been in quite a few situationships. Back in January, I fell for a guy I was really good friends with. Once things started to heat up and get serious, and he started to openly show interest in me, all of the feelings I had for him disappeared. When he would complement me it gave me the ‚Äúick‚Äù. I am not sure if this is due to my past experiences with men or what, but it makes me feel as though I am leading these men on. When in reality I have no clue why this is happening. This has happened twice recently and it makes me feel terrible that I am basically playing with these men‚Äôs emotions when I don‚Äôt even mean to.

"My [27F] Tinder date said he was 6ft online, but when he showed up in person he was barely like 5 '11. I seriously don't even know what to do at this point. I know what I'm looking for in a partner, and I'm so sick of men lying and wasting my time.

I'm a woman of very high standards. I'm not gonna lower my standards for anybody, especially not some random online who I am meeting for the first time. 

So basically I let this guy know up front that I only date guys who are 6 ft or taller. I'm 5 foot 4 myself and in heels I can be quite tall, so I don't think it's too much to ask for. 

The dude shows up and immediately I can tell when we first hug each other, this dude LIED about his height. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't THAT short,  but he had to be like 5 foot 11 MAX. And that's me being generous.

I'm seriously so fed up with men lying about their height on dating apps. Do they really think that we aren't gonna notice?? 

We had an awkward first couple of minutes but then I just straight up told him that I'm not feeling it, then I got an Uber and left the coffee shop that we met at.

"When you're being cold to someone you love in order to push them away, does it also hurt you? A man and I were/are deeply in love with each other, and he was the sweetest and kindest man I'd ever been with. But due to drama on his end, he had to be the one to hold the knife and end our connection for good until we've both healed. Whenever we tried to end things in the past, he tried to end things gently, and it was always clear he was also hurting when he was hurting me.  
  
But this time, when we finally ended things for good, he took a different approach. He was the coldest he'd ever been with me. When I asked him if he was being cold to push me away, he said yes. He needed to be clear in order to not unintentionally give me hope and lead me on any further. I was clearly hurt by his new coldness, but he showed no sign of his hurt or was put into a position where he couldn't show any sign of him feeling terrible while he was hurting me.  
  
So yeah, does it also hurt you when you're being cold to someone you love to push them away? Do you feel bad about it? I'm left questioning and have always been curious about this question for a while anyway.

"I have a feeling that I want to commit suicide over one girl. some backstory, my girlfriend and I broke up around 4 days ago (not a long time, i know that) because she would rather spend time with her friends and only speak to me 5 minutes a day. Which i said that i wasn‚Äôt comfortable with and I need more time with her, in response she said ‚Äúi dont care about your feelings‚Äù. This hurt me but i am so in love with this girl i held on for another 2 weeks and it got worse. She ignored me for days and said hurtful comments. So i broke up with her. She didn‚Äôt care stating ‚Äúokay, i dont love you any more bro‚Äù and sending memes about how i am in pain. Which hurt because i‚Äôd think a 1 year relationship would mean something.

And now I‚Äôm scared i‚Äôll do something terrible to myself after that.

"Would you consider moving to somewhere with a better dating pool? My roommate (27M) and I (26M) rent a house in my hometown (a relatively small beach town in New England). The place is great for what we pay - large private fenced in yard, plenty of off-street parking, cool neighbors, literal 2 minute walk to the beach, etc. This was never really my plan; I graduated college at the height of covid and had to move home to take care of family, and I happened to find a job in town that has been great for my career over the past 2.5 years. I bought my dream truck and motorcycle, take vacations, max out a 401k, have equity in a promising startup, have hobbies, and I'm generally pretty happy. I promise I'm not bragging, but just trying to convey that things are going pretty good. 

The problem here is that this place is pretty remote, and due to rising costs it gets more difficult for people my age to live here every year. I know almost every person my age here, and I could probably count the (single) girls that I have any interest in on one hand. It's a minimum 30 minute drive to go to a bar where I might see new faces.

I've been considering moving somewhere where my hobbies are a little more popular to try to find more dates. This would include finding a new job closer to wherever I move. I'm very conflicted about moving - I'd be leaving behind a lot of family, friends, a great job, and a great living situation. 

What would you do in my shoes? I stay optimistic, but it really feels like I will never find love here. Am I overthinking this? Should I just convince my friends to go out of town more to try to meet new people/find dates?",Infinite-Barnacle-28,0,1690863266.0,0.5,1656,314,1656

"Is It Creepy To Ask A Girl To Reject Me? Reposting from another subreddit. 

*For context: I'm not good with women I find attractive. Most of the time I assume they're creeped out by me. I also don't know where to stop with girls so I just never start to begin with. It sucks.*

*Also, I exaggerate for humor. It may seem like I'm extremely attached to this girl and utterly heartbroken, but this is not true. I am only utterly heartbroken.*

I (24, M) met a girl (no idea, F) via an out-of-state program.  We didn't talk much, mostly because I'm terrible with women I find attractive, but I got a sense that she liked me back. I won't go into the post-mortem here. It was a new feeling for me. I immediately assumed I must be hallucinating the signs of attraction. I kept going back and forth until the very end, mostly because the signs kept getting more pronounced, but nothing significant came out of it. We talked twice one-on-one and several times in group settings.

**For those of you in a similar situation right now:** I'm still kicking myself for not talking to her during the myriad other chances I had. Go talk to whoever it is you like. Ask them out. Don't be like me.

Anyways, I realized at the very end of the program that she wasn't utterly creeped out by me, so I messaged her on an app (whose name I will redact for fear of ridicule) (it's popular and used for work-related stuff). She seemed to be okay with me. The conversation quickly died off, so I left things and assumed I'd been rejected. That was fine by me. I stuffed myself with tamales and moped in private.

Four days later, I was informed that it was *my* fault.

Apparently, I text like a sentient slice of white bread. It's incredibly difficult to continue conversations because my messages feel AI generated. This was a revelation to me, because I'd assumed that she didn't want to talk to me at all. Turns out that wasn't necessarily true. There's a chance I'd misinterpreted the whole thing again.

So I did what any logical person would do. I prepped a message asking for her number, edited it thrice, asked a beta reader to proof-read it, edited it again, scrapped it, wrote something else, downed a few beers, and sent the new message to her at around midnight.

Checked my DMs the next morning. No response. Rejection. Cue sad songs and staring out of car windows longingly.

To reiterate, I'm not obsessed, just melodramatic. It didn't help that I thought she liked me back. I won't lie: I mulled over a lot of our interactions to see if I'd misinterpreted her behavior. It just didn't make sense to me. Still doesn't. Anyways, cut to a few days later, and I delete the app because it has no use for me anymore.

Which is when something occurred to me. *What if she'd done the same thing?*

It is unlikely, but entirely feasible, that she also deleted it because she had no use for it. Our conversation ended three days prior and I hadn't seen her online since then. The first time I texted her, I had confirmation that she was still on it. It was a 'now or never' moment for me. I wasn't stuck to the app all day to find out but she seemed to be on it frequently.

Not this time. As far as I can tell, I hadn't seen her online in days, before or after my message.

(Again -- I would like to emphasize this -- I haven't been checking every hour. I have a life outside pining for this girl. That also means I don't know for sure if my theory is correct.)

There's also no 'seen' notifications on this app.

Now the uncertainty is killing me. Did she ghost me? Did she even see my eloquent little 'u up'? I don't know. I feel like the safest way to find out would be to text her, something to the effect of 'hey, did you even see this? \[app\] doesn't tell me and I'M DYING TO KNOW', but I think that might be too creepy to do. The lack of an answer is tearing me apart. I'd be ~~relatively~~ okay with a rejection at this point, as long as I knew that's exactly what it was.

I'm lost. I don't want to be the guy that double texts after being ghosted and creeps people out. I'll be more of a laughing stock than I already am. On the other hand, I don't want her to see my message a year after everything went down. I want her to know I like her now, and I want to know her answer now. I don't mind on this 1-in-100 edge case.

So, once again, I need your help. Nothing makes sense. I'm driving myself crazy. Someone please tell me what I should (or should not) be doing in this situation. This is my first time expressing interest in a girl too, at least explicitly, so I'm not equipped to deal with this at all.

"Can‚Äôt do dating apps/ can‚Äôt date in general When I (21F) first started having sex, I used dating apps for hookups.

"Flakey Hot Girl 

Hey everyone, just to be clear I understand we are not in a relationship just ""casually dating""


Early this year around March 2023, I met this cute white girl at the beach. I'm black by the way. We are both 22. When I met her we were at the basketball courts on the beach. I was with a my cousin and had made a bet that I could get her number. Mind you before I walked over it was just her and a older gentlemen on the court. As soon as I walk over to make my approach it's likes dudes just came out of no where trying to cock block me and talk to her. It was so many dudes that we had enough for a 5 Vs 5 basketball game. Of course all the dudes wanted to be on her team but somehow me and her ended up being on teams. These dudes were trying there hardest against us. leven got a clean block on the dude who tried to cock block me lol. I had to Cary of course but we still lost. After the game she came up to me and said that I was really good and she apologized for being bad. Of course I took this as an opportunity to Rizz. Now remember the older gentleman she was with well it turns out that was her ""roommate"" and they have been living together for a few months. She just moved to CA September
2022. Of course I got her #. A few weeks pass and man it's like pulling teeth trying to get this girl on the phone or out on a date. One day I lose my phone and all contacts and had to get new phone. Then one day in June I get a text at around 11:00pm asking to hang out. I don't have the number sal V so l assume it's one of my homies and agree. BUt I actually turned out to be her. I pick her up because my car was in the shop and we go back to my place and she is a freak. Definitely some of the best head I ever got and she was tight. But she left her spend the night bag in a Uber. She said that I'm the first guy she been with since moving to LA but I don't believe that. I try to hit her up and make sure she had a good time because she was really drunk and I did not want any Me 2 situations but she was cool but dry text and convo. Later I get her bag from the Uber driver and offers to return it when we hang out again she agrees. But At the time of date she tries to push it back for hours later. I let her know that time doesn't work for me and we can plan another time. She hits me up again on a late night say she is bored and wants to hangout and if I can bring her bag. I agree but I don't respond as fast as the first time and take a while to get to her house but none the less I come. When I get there she tells me some story about how her friend threatened to kill her self and that she can no longer hangout. She ask if I had her bag though and I say no I can bring it later or we can go get it rn from my house but she declined then hoped in another car. I don't care if she is seeing other guys/girls or what not I just want her to respect my time, and to continue have sex with her. She really likes bdsm and I think I do to. I didn't 't like it until I meet her. She is really sexy and feminine around me besides the flakes. It seems like she cares more about her bag than me.

"How do you get over your lovers exes? My (19f) boyfriend (18m) is not sure about staying or leaving this relationship of one year. 
One of the main factors, or maybe even a deal breaker, is that I have an ex, and more important to my bf - me and my ex slept thogether (while dating before I met my by and I met my bf after I ended things with rat, I mean ex).
Now, since this is far away in my last I couldn't care less about it, but he does.
He told me today how quote ,, I knew you had ex but I didn't know you slept with him "" after that I found old messages of him and I that proved that he in fact did know that too, since like day 5 of dating, after finding out he told me ,, I wish I was your first but let's focus on future"". Oh my how did it went so wrong? For few months I was bombarded with jealous about ex I'm in no damn contract with anymore and this is when I made a mistake defending myself how ""it's just my past I can't change it"" instead of being more gentle.

"Is Promiscuity the new normal? How to accept this reality? Edit: Common response is not to judge the book by the cover. I wonder how to judge then? What would signal that woman is actually serious about long term relationship? How to spot a red flag?

Hello folks,
 
I am not trying to be picky on OLD but most women who I find remotely attractive are so sexually provocative in their profiles. I can't swipe right on them. Their profile suggests seeking long term but their pics says otherwise. 

I can't imagine someone in their early 30s would make profile like these if they are seeking a committed relationship. If I have to bet my money they are having casual fun all along but won't mind to settle if someone nice comes their way. 

I am insecure on meeting such women. I don't think I will be able to look past their promiscuous past. I will always think they are settling for me because I was the only loser they could find for commitment. 

Am I stupid for having these thoughts and judging women based on their pics without actually meeting. I am rusty and things might have changed in the past few years. (Out of dating scene for 6 years)

My follow up question would be if a promiscuous woman can change in long term relationship? I wonder if any normal guy tried dating a promiscuous woman. Did it end well for them?",Kaalia22,0,1690323097.0,0.4,1330,244,1330

"My boyfriend is cheating on me and won't admit it Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years and but he's been cheating on me emotionally the whole time. I didn't notice at first cause it was just everyone once in a while but now I haven't spoken to him for more than to say tea is ready I used to just brush it off like a joke. But now I'm feeling like I'm being replaced. He told me he would come be with me at 9pm and decided to wake me up at 4 am because he wanted to cuddle as he had just got to bed 
Hes put me aside all week for this and it's slowly destroying me and I know its not actually cheating but I'm never the priority and he always puts someone else above me all the time i just wanna have his full attention for one night where he isnt glued to a screen and headset and treating me like a live in maid with added benefits when he gets horny. And he's becoming increasingly shattered in bed cause he just wants to go back on his fucking xbox or it god knows what time and he's to tired to bother and I just want it to stop half the time

"Me (25f) and my boyfriend (27M) are having an issue in relation to anime girls and him looking at other woman, he doesn‚Äôt understand my side of the coin at all. How can I make him understand? So, me and my boyfriend have been dating for a solid three years. The main issue we are facing is in relation to anime women. I have informed him of my feelings towards any half naked girls, let alone cartoon character ones.  
  
Out of all of the mousepad options in the world, after having several discussions with me that I am the only one he wants, he hates seeing me sad and after he said he understands my concerns he decides to get one that has two half naked anime girls on it (meanwhile the guys on it are in full armour fully covered and the girls are in bikinis) , obviously these girls have unrealistic features I will never be able to attain, and it makes me severely self conscious.  
  
I have told him how self conscious it makes me (its not like I am fat or anything either, I work out and have a decent body) and how I don't appreciate that he disregarded my feelings and bought it anyway even though we have had so many discussion about my feelings and how I dont appreciate it. (which tbh I think is fair, a relationship should be about each other and only wanting to look at eachother I dont understand how men see it as a nonhurtful thing, to surround yourself with girls that your girlfirend will never be able to look like. Constantly putting me up to the standard of them, because that is who he wants on his mousepad.  
  
It always a huge fight and that I shouldn't be so ""dramatic"" because they aren't real. But these are my genuine concerns and feelings.  
  
Here is where it gets flipped around, I get shamed for talking to male coworker because he apparently has ""feelings or a crush on me"" but I think of him as a really great friend. He has never done or said anything sexual towards me, but I get shamed for talking to him. But get my feelings put down when he has a mat with two girls on it, when all the dude on it are fully closed and look badass. But the two girl characters on the show are wearing literally bikinis and the dude are wearing full armour.  
  
Bascially, I am not the type to seek revenge, always have been to kind and deer spirited to ever stand up for myself like this. but after years of being cheated on, and having anime chosen over me in the past damn straight I am going to voice and show the hypocrisy.  
  
I want to make him see how much he hurt me by getting that mousepad, and I really need some advice on how to deal with this. Why can't men just like one woman, I dont care if he has female friends, but his female friends arent half naked\~?  
  
Please help. I dont know what to do anymore, I just need some form of advice, anything to make him realize my pain.",midna_4life,0,1690568167.0,0.5,2838,538,2838

"I'm falling very hard for a bad boy at my school. so, I'm an (18M) who got transferred to this new school. it's been almost one month I haven't made much friends there, only a few anyways so the point is there is this guy (M18)in my school let's call him noah. so, noah is one of the popular guy at the school. like a typical tall jock and very attractive but a complete d_ckhead tbh. every girl is chasing him. i hate him the way he acts but a part of me really likes him. i had a crush on him ever since I met him. But now my feelings for him are getting stronger day by day. But there's a problem I'm gay and he looks like a typical straight mean guy but I believe he likes me too

 I tell you why, so from few weeks I have noticed some signs I mean there's always some kind of sexual tension between us. Like 2 days ago I went to a party I got super drunk, got wild and there was some random dude who tried to take advantage of me but Noah came in and saved me and dropped me home (a friend of mine told me abt this Incident bcoz I didn't remember anything as I was drunk Asf) . he behaves kind of awkward when I'm around. also I have caught him staring at me a few times. he argues/fights with me a lot like last week he was fighting with one of friend so I stepped in to support  her (I can't resist a fight LMAO) and I called him a as_hole and Some other bad cuss words too .

 I know he has a really short temper like if u curse him, be prepared to get your ass beaten up.I knew it but still, I cussed at him bcoz a part of me knows that he wouldn't hurt me. Also I like to test his patience LMAO. We both have a love and hate relationship. hate is mutual and love is from my side I don't know about him. I want to ask him if he's interested in me but don't want to make it awkward. do u guys think that does he has feelings for me? Please give your opinions in the comment section.

He maybe a total nut job but the one thing I really like about him is the way he treats his sister. Like he really respect  her and very protective towards her. It's cute right? 

Tldr, I can't control loving this bad guy in my school even if he acts like total moron. He appears to be to typical straight guy but I think hes not I think he's gay or at least bi . I have noticed some signs which point towards that he prob interested in me what do  U guys think?

"How to leave my gf in the most brutal way ? So for the context,

I have been dating my gf for almost 2 years and she is around 3 years older than me.

The problem dating her since the beginning was that she often used to emphasis about her cousin guy and lots of other relative guys wanting to marry her whenever we get into any conflict. I would rather use the word 'flex' because she used to say that she has lots of other option than me. But there has not been a single time when I let her doubt about any girl's name on our fights.

I thought her ego would get washed out with time after sometime but today I realized I was totally wrong.

For the present context , I happened to saw a chat between my gf and one of her old guy , the guy wanting to marry my gf which was also my gf's relative but not by blood. The guy called her for the facetime and after my gf didn't reply, he texted 'kali'. That word means 'dark color skin girl' (with a sense of love). And after few calls here and there they facetimed for some few minutes back and forth.

The problem here isn't that my gf talked with that guy. Back in honeymoon phase of our relationship I once called her you are my 'kali' and she was offended so bad that we nearly broke up and she still sometime taunts me about that incident whenever we have fights. But now she is okay with someone else calling her that word.

Yeah stayed loyal the whole time, loved her to edge but now I am profoundly not okay about what has happened and I think I should breakup with her in a very brutal way that she will regret her whole life.

"I cry myself to sleep, heads over heels for this girl Updates on falling in love with a fellow intern...
The original post can be found in my profile, can't post links... For context I(25M) and the girl I'm having the feelings for is (22F).

As of yesterday, 31 July 2023, the intern that came in 5 weeks ago, that I have been having such intense feelings for had her final day at the organization.

 I got her a farewell gift pack consisting of a little card that stated my utmost thanks to her for the last 5 weeks, that she made me rediscover some things about myself and that our interactions have made me so happy and comfortable. I also gave a her little Teddy bear and some snacks. I asked to take a couple of photos with her, which we did. Afterwards, she drove me to the nearest train station which has been quite the going home routine over the past 2 weeks, and in the car I told her that I'm really, really thankful of her for the past 5 weeks, and that her being in my life at a low point in my life which was at the end of June and throughout July made me really grateful towards her.

 And I told her I really enjoyed our time together and our banter which she said she enjoyed the banter too. I then told her let's hang from time to time which she said she'll let me know. So at the very least it wasn't an outright ""no"", which I'm a little happy about.

Today, 1st August, at work, the sight of her empty desk and seat which is right across mine..and just remembering her coming into the roo, and lighting up the room and my life, the paths we walked in the workplace, her smile, her empty seat..ugh fuck I just broke down right there and them..that was about 15 minutes ago. I'm now writing this in the hope that it will do me good and a cry for help too?

"Women can love more than one man at the same time. Many men I have spoken to believe women are incapable of loving two men simultaneously.    They are under this illusion that once a woman develops feelings for guy #2, she will withdraw from guy #1.  

I‚Äôd like to share with those who believe women cannot love two men at the same time. 

I‚Äôve personally got myself tangled up twice with women who were in love with me and with their other partner.    The situation was extremely frustrating and overwhelmed with sadness.   

These two women would make out with me and have sex with me but would not separate themselves from their other partners.      They also enjoyed having sex with those people.   

When I found out I ended the relationships but they would cry and become extremely angry and threatening.    They would bombard my phone with texts and calls begging me not to leave, that they would dump their partner to secure me, though that never happened, and would never happen.   

When a woman loves more than one guy simultaneously, this is called polyamory.     She will never let go off one partner for the other.    And she will do her best to meet her partners physical needs.

"I think this is evil Hello Lady's and gentelman,

I have a question directed especially for the lady's here.

I have been dating since I was a kid,Pretty intrested in the opposite sex,

Now almost all the girl's that I had I have met face to face  (there was a couple internet exception's..)(I dont have a problem to start chatting with a complete stranger face to face).

I am personally against using social media like facebook,tiktok,Instagram (especially) etc.. (I know that you can play with what you define as 'social media',But I dont include under this definition:dating platform's or website/forum's under this )

So I signed up to this dating site a short time ago,Put my personal info,add a couple of photo's and here we go.

Now I dont like it,since I know that there are situation's that there 200 guys on 1 chick and it can take time till she even see that you have sended her a massage...

I am pretty attractive guy (I try to be attractive from the inside too),I would say very handsome looking + working out seriously (Naturally,for almost a decade).

For this question I put my stat's,

My dry stat's: 1.79cm (should be around 5""10.5),and 96 kilos (around 18% fat for now).

Now,I saw this girl on the dating website,and she posted on her front page:""If you are above 1.80 talk to me"".

Now this thing really pissed me off on the personal level(she is 1.75,I dont say nothing about it for now).

I didnt even chatted with her or something (And of course I wont even chat with her,not beacouse of the height thing,But there is a whole list of requirements down there(dont have tatoos,dont have this long hair blah blah blah),And instead that she will write about herself a little more,about her personality,she is writing what she dont want in the man that will date with her..)I think it is easier to get a computer science/physic's degree than figure out what she want).

Anyway,I imagine,If I was into her,And We have met face to face,And I always try to be very nice or you can call it 'gentelman' especially in the beginning,(Also to understand who is this person in front of me etc),If she is a mentally healthy person,She would never had said ohh you are too short for me (I know that in this case it's 1 cm and she wont care about it anyway,But this is not about me).

Like what if a guy is 1.70 and the girl let's say 1.75?or 1.78?

What you wont date a guy only because of his height?

What if someone shorter so he is not ""good enough""?what is this?

I know that this height thing is mostly BS,And either way woman will be attracted to a guy that know how to talk to her,rather than for technical 'physical stat's'/appearance.

And I personally had girls my height (even that I rarely meet girl's this height or taller),we was in great relationship,and even I was asked by one of them (from her side) to go out on date.

So I want to hear your opinion.

Thanks for your time.

"Am I (17F) wrong for ending the relationship(16M) because of my preference? TL;DR: Guy I used to date would lust over other women and tried to hit up my friend. I blocked him without an explanation. am i wrong?


A while ago, this guy from my school texted me on Instagram complimenting me and basically hinting that I was attractive. He told me he noticed me in the cafeteria everyday, and that from day one he was too afraid to approach me. Well that‚Äôs when I made my move and the conversation started to spark from there. Every time someone shows interest in me, I tend to check their following just to see who they‚Äôre mutuals with or out of curiosity. 


I noticed that this guy followed a lot of insta models and very pretty local girls that went to my school. I tend to find this common within guys so I basically let it slide since we weren‚Äôt really in a relationship. Well, like a week later he asked me out and i accepted, still aware of his following but not really taking it to heart. It was nice, we did things together and hung out after school. However, after a month it kinda started to bother me, especially considering the fact that he liked photos from several models that recently posted within a day. I tried not to take it personal, but it was after he kept telling me I was the only girl he had his eyes set for, that really triggered me in a sense. Like I really don‚Äôt care about men masturbating to porn, but lusting over women that didn‚Äôt look anything like me is depressing. And yet when I would talk to him about certain guys I found attractive just to be even, he got highly upset with me. He was even in my friend‚Äôs messages, calling her attractive and never let her know he was in a relationship.

After that, I basically blocked him without having him explain himself because we have had conversations about this in the past, and he told me ‚Äújust because i follow girls doesn‚Äôt mean you have to break up with me‚Äù; I gave him several chances after that but it just kept getting worse. He would try and hide his phone from me even though he literally asked for my account, he moved every girl he talked to into General on insta, and he would even like local girls bikini pics.

From that point I deleted social media to try and heal. Im just wondering if I‚Äôm crazy for feeling the way I do. I‚Äôm not trying to date someone who would leave me in a heartbeat for a person who is more physically attractive than i am. He would always get physical with me as well, even when I made it clear I just wanted to have a nice conversation",Top-Job-4783,0,1690926198.0,0.5,2556,484,2556
"I'm (F27) not having sex while dating, so many men tell me they're interested or like me, even guy friends, but after a month they're like ""I'm not interested"". This is proof that a majority of men only want sex, not a relationship and women should opt out of dating men. This is like clock work. So many men tell me they like me or are interested in me. It can be guys from school, work, events, my friends friends or whatever. And then I'm like ok sure, we can date but I'm not having sex with you unless we are in a serious relationship.

They think I'm joking or that they're going to change my mind, and then when they realize I'm firm on my words after 1-2 months they're like ""I'm not interested"" or ""i was never into you I guess"".

To me this is just proof that most men have absolutely no interest in dating or a serious relationship with a man. If you're looking for a relationship as a woman, just dont bother.",Adventurous_Pipe6763,0,1690739975.0,0.44,921,177,921

"I (37M) went to South America and saw J (31F), but she didn‚Äôt post anything about us on her socials while I was there. I went to South America for two weeks in early July and got back a few days ago. I went to Antigua for a week for Spanish classes and went to Bogota for a week to meet up with J. I met her about 3 months ago dancing in DC. 

Antigua was great and Bogota was amazing.  J was an awesome tour guide. Things seemed to go well. I think she thought light kissing and hand holding was going too fast though. I did get a few serious kisses in but no sex. She‚Äôs a virgin. Cool. Nbd. I paid for everything because I didn‚Äôt want my tour guide to pay for my trip and because my US dollars spent a lot better. She‚Äôs not nearly as well off as me as a Colombian national. 

She‚Äôs been all about getting to know each other ‚Äúslowly‚Äù and building a relationship instead of just one where we hook up this summer and go on our merry way. No worries. I‚Äôm looking for something more than that too. We‚Äôve texted just about every day since we met. She was asking me how my days were and generally showing a genuine interest in how I was doing.

While I was there she insisted we take a ton of photos. Cool. I was totally down with that. Pictures of us. The things we did. When we had dinner on my last day she was trying food off my plate as soon as it hit the table. But she never posted any pictures of us on her insta while I was there and hasn‚Äôt really reached out since I‚Äôve been back. 

She also posted a video of the belly dancer that was at the restaurant the night we went out. Short video. It got a few likes. I made a comment about how ‚Äúi hear that place is nice!‚Äù, nothing major, but she deleted it. üòÇ 

It seems odd we hit it off so well and have been in such constant contact but to not have her post anything about me on her insta. To be honest it‚Äôs way too far and the distance is a huge deal breaker for both of us. 

TLDR: She clearly doesn‚Äôt want anything more even as friends, but my question is, are socials really so private to some people?",Nblearchangel,0,1690310969.0,0.5,2057,413,2057

* I'm not really a crazy looker but i know i'm not hideous 
* I don't have a job and i've never had one
* I go outside semi often and hangout with people but spend most of my time alone
* I don't have many other hobbies other than listening to music, video games and reading, I ride my bike sometimes.
* I have no issue talking to people at all in literally any context, I get along with most people of all backgrounds .
* I complain a lot and confine with friends when people leave my life because of major attachment issues
* I don't workout
* I don't really trust people after constant fuck up's in relationships
* I don't speak my mind because I fear that everything i say will be too much and set everything up in flames
* I think i complain a lot
* I live in the past (I.E, When me and so and so stopped talking, if i was riding my bike and i pass their street i get off my bike and wonder where shit went wrong.)
* I still try to keep a connection when things are iffy in that moment leading to them ghosting me.

"Why are so many men embracing toxic dating advice? There was a dating advice website dedicated to men, and one of it's articles had the following advice:

""*When looking for a life partner, my advice to men is date all of them: the bad girls, the cool girls, the commitment-phobic girls, the crazy girls. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad girls sexy do not make them good wives. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks men should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do her share in the home. These women exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier.*""

"Feeling flustered, not sure how to proceed. Ok, so I have a girlfriend, and we've been together for almost 2 months now. I really like her, she really likes me, and we're happy with eachother. I've even met her family already, and I can see myself being with her for a long time.

Now comes the doozy. There's these other girls I work with, younger girls I believe, some underage (yikes), that have changed the way the act around me. They've been friendlier and talking to me more. A large part of me just wants to dismiss it as them warming up to me and enjoying working with me, but there's still a slice of my mind that's paranoid that I'm gonna accidentally break someone's heart, whether it be me letting them down or the heat of the moment making me do something to ruin my current relationship.

How do I go about this? Can I just explain it to them? I feel like that might come off as arrogant.  ""Hey, are you flirting with me? I have a girlfriend, so I'm not interested.""

Do I try to distance myself? I do enjoy their company, and it doesn't really strain our work relationship, it just pops up in my mind from time to time, the way they act.

"(Need some situationship advice) He gets offended if I stop being cheesy. I don't want to put in the effort unless we're dating. It's a privilege to be my partner and he's not getting it for free. For some context; we both liked each other in 2018 and 2019 but we were scared to confess so we moved on, dated new people and got cheated on, we reconnected and I confessed first, then we both fell for each other. We aren't dating yet because we're both not ready for a long distance relationship and I still have trust issues from being cheated on. We mutually agreed that we won't date anyone else and we'll date each other next year. 

It's like we're already dating but without the label. He keeps telling me he's afraid of hurting me, afraid of losing me, afraid he won't find another who would put in the effort like me. We flirt with each other on a daily basis, call each other 'babe' and say 'I love you's. The moment I talk to him without the flirting, he gets sad. I'm just thinking, why should I put in the effort if we aren't even dating? I have trust issues from being cheated on too. 

He doesn't have any red flags that I'm ignoring, he's motivating me to do better, he's understanding and caring, he respects my boundaries, there's no doubt he's way better than my ex. 

But if we both can't commit right now, why are we acting like a couple? If he really wants me to flirt and put in the effort, he has to upgrade me to the 'girlfriend' title.

I found a wholesome post on MNFH subreddit where a guy from Sweden launched a form with questions like how fast you reply, how open you are in conversation etc and the 8th response was of a girl from Turkey which stood out to him.

What if there was an app where you post your introduction and let AI know what you are looking for. So if you are not someone who like people who text out of boredom or who have other intentions than what you are looking for, you can ask the bot to match people accordingly.

The way I plan to do is by making an app only for redditors out there making friends online where unlike any other social app, there are no comments but only posts where every reply on that post is a conversation. It is up to the person to either reply privately or publicly, in which case he will also let other people discover his thoughts through his conversations.

"Can different fun time drives ruin relationships? Hi long time Reddit reader here. I‚Äôve never posted anything but I figured it might help to get this out since I don‚Äôt any one to really talk to about this. Also this is 18+ can‚Äôt figure out how to put it on here. 

I (20F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together for about a year and a half. For a bit of context: we have known each other since we were kids and even lived down the street from each other. I had the biggest crush on him when we were in middle school but we remained friends for the sake of our friendship. Well fast forward a few years and we‚Äôre in our senior year. After a lot of stuff at his house, he ended up moving in at my moms for the second semester of our senior year. Yes we had to share a room but I had a giant beanbag he slept on and we never did anything. 

In October of 2021, we got the apartment we‚Äôre at now and have been here since. We didn‚Äôt start even talking about our feelings for each other until February and then eventually we got together in April of 2022. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets a little more relevant. 

I was a virgin when me and my boyfriend got together but he‚Äôs been active since he was about 15. Now I‚Äôve never had a problem with that. It‚Äôs a small town and honestly I didn‚Äôt care because we weren‚Äôt together at that point. 

We went through that honeymoon phase where there was a bunch of making out whenever we could, constantly texting each other, you get the idea. And we‚Äôre doing great now even after we ‚Äúcalmed down‚Äù. And he was always patient with me when I said I wanted to wait. Well about late February we finally sealed the deal. And it was amazing. I found a side of myself I really like. 

But now it seems he just doesn‚Äôt want to get intimate anymore. At first we had a lot of makeout sessions and fun time. Then slowly it‚Äôs turned into a couple of kisses lead to fun time. I miss those makeout sessions where he pays attention to my body. Make me feel beautiful. Now it‚Äôs a feel kisses and then it. Nothing more. Afterwards he plays his game or something. I realize I have a much higher fun time drive than him and he says it‚Äôs bc he had all his fun growing up and that I‚Äôm just starting it. But he doesn‚Äôt want fun time if he isn‚Äôt in the mood and it‚Äôs gotten to the point that I quit initiating it because it hurt to keep getting turned down. He told me I could use some of our toys but those never really worked for me. We went two weeks without fun time. we finally had fun and he said it was because of the leggings. He wasn‚Äôt in the mood until I went out in leggings. 

We‚Äôve talked about it and he said I could use the toys but he can‚Äôt help it if he‚Äôs not in the mood. So the other day I was really bothered and said I was going to take a long shower. I went looking for the toys and he (while on the Xbox with his friends) asked jokingly, ‚Äúoh going to have some fun time in there?‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs gonna be a long shower‚Äù

He looked at me shocked and asked if I was serious. I said yes bc he said if I was bothered to use toys if he wasn‚Äôt in the mood. He said he didn‚Äôt I actually would. I asked when would I have time to do it? Bc our schedules are almost exactly the same except for our days off and I can‚Äôt exactly going a a full week like that or I‚Äôll be a mess and angry. I got too embarrassed and just took a normal shower. But even then. With that big hint. We didn‚Äôt have fun until almost a week later. He used to take showers with me and that was where our make out sessions usually started at lately. But now I get maybe a shower with him every month?? 

God I just feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. Is this normal? Is it normal to react this way? 

I‚Äôm just ranting honestly. And don‚Äôt let all of that give you the wrong impression of him. He is one of the most amazing guys I have met. He‚Äôs so sweet and attentive and helpful. He gets me coffee in the morning our days off whether I‚Äôm still asleep or don‚Äôt feel like getting up. He will listen when I‚Äôm mad and let me rant about everything. He gives me space when I‚Äôm mad. Gives me kisses and back rubs when I had a bad day. And this man has a super tough job with long hours so I try not hold it against him but when we‚Äôve talked so many time and he‚Äôs worked here just under a year and a half, it‚Äôs hard to let it go sometimes I guess.

I just feel like he doesn‚Äôt find me attractive or something anymore. He shows me he loves me in every other way so I feel like it‚Äôs ridiculous to feel like this. 

I don‚Äôt expect any responses, I just really wanted to get this off my chest. And it‚Äôs probably a mess so I‚Äôm sorry if I confused anyone.",random_cat_lover21,1,1690301983.0,1.0,4639,933,4639

"Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl

So, to sum it up, I can't get hard with this girl. She makes me anxious and when I'm with her sex is in my head all the time... Other factor is that she is way more experienced than me and she talks about sex with no taboos at all, this is very new to me and makes me compare to this other experiences she have had.

On the other hand, I'm seeing this other girl at the same time that attracts me way less than the first one and I can have sex with her just fine. I know this means something, but I'm starting to really like this first one (maybe I'm in love?) and this whole situation is making me very anxious and uncomfortable. I really want to get my erections back. What do I do? It's driving me nuts! 

I know I probably should treat this anxiety I have with her, but it's totally sex related. We've already tried to have sex more than 5 times and could only once for just a few minutes, all the other attempts were failed and left me completely ashamed. I've already tried viagra but even that won't work with her. I need to get over this, it means a lot to me. We've talked and she said it's fine and I'm trying to assure her everything will be okay but as of now im starting to think maybe I should just brake up with her, which I don't want to do.

"Bad luck or my fault? I've begun to really wrestle with the philosophy of bad luck vs my own inadequacies the last couple years because of my story; Basically I had a first relationship that lasted 5 and a half years starting at the end of my teens and I believe a lot of its longevity was down to my work ethic and ability to know what a girl requires and treat her right (until I decided that I wanted to try something different, maybe a huge mistake on my part) so I have a self assurance/confidence about my ability to maintain a relationship. 

But in the 4 years since it has trying to find a new relationship that has alluded me. I went to university and devoted most of my efforts into being as social as possible - especially for the first year I became known as the social, charismatic guy in my circles and knew a pretty insane amount of people tbh, like on friendly terms with a lot. Important to mention due to my university about 80 percent of these people were girls so you probably wouldn't imagine that I've barely had 2 non substantial shows of interest (that never went anywhere) from girls romantically in those 4 years. It's led me to question where I'm going wrong, like 'is it my looks' (even though before I always considered myself to be average to kinda decent with good style etc) or is it actually luck that has been the major factor I've been missing.

"Sigh* another failed talking stage. I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for almost a month.

"After failed relationships, losses of loved ones, and my most recent breakup earlier this year, lead to a lot of self reflection- I have abandonment issues I‚Äôm not really venting but here to give my own opinions on if you are dipping your toe back into the dating pool after a breakup.

Are you okay? Did you reflect enough on your actions and the actions of your former partner? Are you in a healthy place to start dating again? If you still talk about your ex all the time, probably not.

Time is our most valuable asset. We can never make more of it. Why waste your time on a date if you‚Äôre not ready? Oh you‚Äôre lonely? Then go make friends. Don‚Äôt look for a partner to fill a void. Find fulfillment in yourself, then you can find someone to share that with. 

I‚Äôm not ready to date. I still think about my ex and I miss her, and I miss the companionship. I‚Äôve recently started to fall for someone else, but I know I‚Äôm not in the right place to date right now, and my feelings are reciprocated anyways (I haven‚Äôt confessed anything, nor will I ever, as this person is a friend, and we met as friends, and I wouldn‚Äôt risk this friendship. Plus - think my late sister sent me to look after this person, but that‚Äôs a whole other story).

If I‚Äôm not in the right mind to date, I would not just waste my time, but the time of someone else, and pretty much guaranteed heartbreak. I realized now I truly have to be content with being alone, before i consider dating again.

I guess my only concern is, now that I‚Äôm living alone, once I‚Äôm okay with being alone, will I even want to date at that point. I think of how she (the person I have been developing feelings for) makes me feel when I‚Äôm around her or speaking with her, and I desire to have a partner like that. I guess I‚Äôm struggling with the idea of being content with being alone and the desire to feel the calm I feel when im talking to her.

This new girl im dating is nice, has all the traits im looking for and we are really compatible atleast for now.

Today after 5 days into the relationship, we had sex and she did say it was awsome and compliments like that. 

But, like an idiot i pressed her if it was the best,  which she admitted it wasnt, nor the best sex nor the best first sex she had with one of her exes. 

Now i know i made a huge fucking mistake asking that but i thought i wouldnt get insecure about it. 

That stuff is now in my head and i know its insecurities but we are both really,  and i mean really into each other,  and she said it doesnt matter and she really did her best reassuring me. But it makes me insecure thinking i wasnt her best first sex in the relationship experience and that i wasnt able to get on that level or if i can even topple in the future the best sex she had.

Now i know this is all stupid but we are quite madly in love with eachother, its the honeymoon phase and it (Mutually) this is like a unique one in a kind, or one in a million relationship where we really clicked almost literally everywhere insanely, so i have the desire to be the best or unique i guess.

"Ghosting I (25 yr old male) got ghosted and I don't fully understand why.

We met on one of the popular dating apps. After we had a couple facetime sessions that went well, we decided to schedule an in person date at her apartment. We agreed that I would bring wine and my video game system and we would play video games and build a Lego set (probably a big mistake on my part), although she did have work the next day.

After driving down to her apartment to meet her, I immediately began to set up the game system, chatted with her a little, and eventually after a little struggle with set up, we finally started playing. We drank some wine, played some video games, and talked. We were struggling to keep a extend conversation due to the amount of things going on, and I decided to flirt with her a little and I kissed her. This was probably my biggest mistake as it was very quick and awkward. I did it because I wanted to show that I was still romantically interested. Looking back though, it was probably creepy and probably what really killed the vibe, along with the dying conversation.

I then proceeded to stay on her couch a little bit longer while I sobered up to drive home and eventually said my good byes, and left.  She did text me after I got back home to see if I was ok but it's been radio silent ever since.

This isn't the first date I've been ghosted (3rd)  at so I'm starting think the problem is me. What can I do to at least not be a weirdo and maybe get a second date, or even a response.

"We‚Äôre exclusive but not official? How do I go about this? Been dating this girl for a couple months, we‚Äôve had a great time and both explained we like each other a lot! We love spending time together.

While she explained she wanted to go slow, and I agreed, I also wanted to know if this was going anywhere. Last night I asked her what are we, is it official, is this going in the right direction?

She said she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to put a label on it, she hasn‚Äôt talked to literally anyone since we‚Äôve met and neither have I. We‚Äôre exclusive but not a thing officially.

I asked do you think in time will we want to label it official? I feel more comfortable knowing it‚Äôs serious. She said she has no idea, she doesn‚Äôt want to do any of that. 

Where do I go from here? I believe her when she says she‚Äôs talking to nobody else because I know she‚Äôs not an outgoing person at all, very reserved. I just feel more comfortable knowing we are together than loosely defining what we are doing. I feel like issues will arise if not labeled.

I saw that as a sign of her possibly being particularly interested. I‚Äôve also noticed that she isn‚Äôt very active on the app but that from what I‚Äôve noticed she seems to open the app to answer my texts only (due to an activity feature telling you when a user was last on the app).

Usually I‚Äôm the one bringing the conversation forward which isn‚Äôt a good sign but her answers are always more intricate than they would‚Äôve needed to be.

"Do women find ghosting to be letting someone down easy? (context) I'm aware I'm really awkward socially and over text. I don't like pushing boundaries because I think it's creepy and I'm pretty straight forward with what I'm looking for. I'm trying to see if I'm the problem or if it's something else. feel free to be brutally honest I don't care much and I'm more just curious.

I've been ghosted at least 5 times now. And then I've been stood up twice (since I broke up with my ex) it kind of bothers me cause I don't know if it's the fact I don't have much experience with all these dating games and whatever. It never came to me naturally and it just kind of hurts when I'm excited to get to know someone better in person but I just end up getting left alone, waiting and feeling like an idiot. Looking back over things I said and being confused as to what I did wrong. I get that I don't come across as confident or funny maybe? But I'd rather hear a ""no"" or ""not my type"" then be scared of even approaching anyone now because I feel like it's doomed to fail. I see a chance to start a conversation and I don't take it anymore because I just get humiliated, it makes me feel like I've missed out on something other guys have. I don't understand. I'm fit, healthy, always initiate conversation, always the one to take the first step. Things that I thought where attractive. Now I just feel really hurt like I'm doing something wrong. Normally this stuff doesn't get to me but seeing all my mates get girlfriends and it seeming like the time of their lives when I'm just alone really makes me feel like I'm just not worth anything. I don't hate women for this don't get me wrong, I just feel like nothing I do is the right thing and I haven't had the experience in life to be able to approach these situations properly. I'm tired of trying now and I'm just lost. I focus on myself so that I can distract myself from it and it goes well most days, but it gets to me at times like now when I could be spending time with someone who I love and loves me back but I instead just sit here alone looking to strangers on the internet for advice cause no one in my life knows how to help me either, or they just tease me for being a loser.

"Does it creep you out when someone asks you out? I (27m) recently went to breakfast with an acquaintance (22m) who's soon going to take some of the same career paths that I took. He asked if we could meet and I agreed, thinking it would be a big bro - little bro kind of conversation. 

I show up and get a table and he arrives shortly afterwards and it quickly becomes clear to me that this is a date to him. I've known he is gay but have not expressed my own sexuality, so I took a moment to let him know that I'm straight and not interested in him that way, but would be happy to remain an acquaintance as a resource for him as he moves forward. 

He agrees and the food arrives and he keeps complimenting my beard and telling me I'm pretty and his type and his foot never seemed to stay on his side of the table. I began to feel more and more uncomfortable as the meeting progressed and he continued to make it seem like a date, asking me personal questions that had nothing to do with the aforementioned ""working relationship"".

I left the diner with a sour taste in my mouth, feeling like my wishes weren't respected and that this kid was walking all over me.

I can't believe that girls and women have to deal with this all the time. 

Personally, I like to think that I am good about respecting a ""no"" from a girl that I ask out, or when she turns down a second date even though I want one. I can't help but hurt inside to think that I might have made people feel powerless, uncomfortable, and without escape on a date, and that I pressed the issue.

Now my happenstance, she and me are in the same city. So she stays 14km (8.7miles) away from. So we decided to meet.

I told her how I feel pressurised to uphold the conversation and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm talking to myself. She was quite understanding and assured me but still things haven‚Äôt improved. I don‚Äôt want to force her to talk to me because that seems desperate.

"i (28F) Ghosted a breadcrumber (30M)....but was it too late? I met someone I liked on OKC and we met up for a date. I had a lot of fun with him and the night ended in sex.

We dated for about 2 months. But about one month in, we got into a pretty big argument about our status. I liked him at the time, but I was also seeing someone else. he was seeing other people as well. its worth saying the physical connection was very much there.

We made up and kept seeing each other. about 2 weeks ago, we went out and it came up that both of the other people we were seeing hadn't worked out, for unrelated reasons. We also laughed about some pretty crummy dates we had gone on recently. I said something like ""well, I like you and now neither of us is seeing anyone else."" We got into talks about our relationship and it ended in a pretty heated fight. Not great.

We made up over the phone a couple days later. Within that argument, he had told me he felt like I didn't communicate enough day to day, so I started texting and reacting to his IG stories more regularly. I thought this might be a good sign, that he wanted to connect more.

Over the course of a few weeks, he said I was the most fun date he'd ever been on, best sex hed ever had, best kisser, and he was always rock hard around me (true from what I could tell), that he had talked to me about things he hadnt talked to other people about.

While he was always responsive, I started to notice he didn't initiate very often, though he did once in a while, usually when I was really busy. one week, I went on a girls trip and he started texting me a lot. we sexted, but also spoke more than we probably ever had, about everything. I was feeling really connected to him

When I got back, I was excited to see him. But he just got more distant. I tried to make plans....he was busy. by now it had been 2 weeks since we'd seen each other (trip included) and I was really confused. Why had he been texting me so much while I was away if he didn't even want to actually see each other? I started to think he was just using me for attention. he was also taking a longer time to respond. he was breadcrumbing me. I stopped reaching out.

Over the next week, I went silent, he started to initiate. I ignored, still thinking about what I wanted to do here. I am attracted to him and I know he knows. He reached out to me 3 times. but it was all shallow stuff, like ""hey, how have you been?,"" complimenting how I looked in my IG story, before finally sending ""????"" But I dont care how many times you compliment me. If he likes me, he should want to see me, not just complement me on instagram

Knowing I needed to move on, I downloaded a dating app. day two, I saw he ""liked me.""  I matched with him, but I didn't start a convo (and on bumble you have to). The time to start a convo got down to the last hour and he extended it. I  said his profile pictures looked familiar (I had taken them) and he complimented my photos. I regretted it. I blocked him on both the app, and IG.

Look, I know this is stupid, but I know most of you have been here. We're probably not a good fit... I know. I am trying to move on.

The truth is, I want him to reach back out, because it did feel sort of good to know he was actually noticing my absence. I liked thinking that he missed me, that he was stressing when I didnt respond, that he was surprised that, despite how much he knew I liked him, I would walk away. Him realizing I wasn't quite wrapped around his finger as he thought.

In hindsight, I think he kinda liked riling me up about him a little, because our fights were very avoidable. At this point, I probably wont go back. I have been going on dates with new people.

And I know its just guessing, but I'd like to know what was going on in his head because I'm kinda in the dumps about it and its making it harder for me to date. I'd like to be able to trust myself when I feel chemistry again, and not be fearful that its all in my head.",Different-Total3557,1,1690606426.0,1.0,3986,792,3986

"The contact seems a bit getting distant suddenly (or am I just overthinking?) Hi guys!

I got a thingy here;

3 weeks ago I \[29F\] met a guy through Twitch. \[30M\]  (I stream also, so common interest) I randomly joined his stream one day, I thought he was very good looking. I added him on instragram, but with no intention (yet).

That same night he saw that I was still online quite late, so he started the conversation through instagram DM asking me what I was doing still awake so late. Since then the contact was quite 'intense' but very open and very nice.At some point I asked his number, so we could continue our conversation on Whatsapp. It was still very intense contact, and very open to eacheahtorer. He told me I seem very fun, bubbly open person, and he liked that. It felt very natural, and he didn't had that feeling before with someone he met through twitch for example.

He told me he was very curious about me, and he wanted to get into a Discord call alone with him, and game together.

The first appointment we made I cancelled because I felt ill, he said he was really looking forward to it, so he was bummed we didn't had that call that day.But we called the next day. Was very fun, open, easy and outgoing call, velt very natural and fun like we know each other for years.

After that call finished he told me he even was a bit nervous for our first call together, thought that was kinda cute. He really was curious about me, and wanted to see me in real life. I also wanted the same.

So after.. think about 2 weeks we met up, I traveled to his place.   (1 hour and 30 on public transportation)|I already told him on beforehand, that I only meet with guys up, if there's at least some potential to get something serious out of it. (I'm just done with al the FWB, and one night stands) and he agreed, and has the same.

I was at his place, it felt very natural, like I've known him for quite a while.Since he picked me up we didn't stop talking.And I even stayed at his place. Yes, we did has sex, normally I would wait for that, but since we don't really live that close to each other and it felt okay I was like f\*ck it.

After that date, I went home, and I texted him, how he was thinking about all this and he just want to see where it goes or is this just it.He told me he really liked it, and wanted just to see where this goes.Okay great you would think!

The contact through whatsapp still kinda stayed the same, on beforehand when he was for example live-streaming, in between the stream he would send me small texts like to ask what I'm doing etc. Or when he was finished, asking me if I'm still awake.

Last few times I wasn't awake, so I didn't react to that. Because I wasn't planning to stay awake every time. (he livestreames till 2:00 am, and I wanted to get my bedtime routine back to normal)

Since then I've noticed he isn't like really texting me that frequently anymore. I don't know if it's because he probably thinks im not awake anymore, but ive noticed he isn't texting like he used to while he was live-streaming. Like almost nothing anymore.

For example, yesterday in the midday we played Fortnite together for like 4 hours, but after that I didn't got any text anymore, not the full day and even after his stream.

Is it because he thinks im probably not awake anymore or is het just kinda losing interest? I don't anymore. I know im a really good over thinker.

Do you guys have some advice or tips perhaps? What should I do? Maybe let it depend on him now and not texting him anymore or? I really have the urge if he for example didn't texted me by tomorrow to ask if there's something wrong maybe, but that's perhaps not the best thing to do..

Really would love some advice here or tips on what to do. ",MariekePiekee,1,1690606737.0,1.0,3762,713,3762

"Guy (22M) I‚Äôve (22F) been dating for a 4 months seems to have a crush on one of his friends from where he used to live. 
He used to live in Arizona for school. He said that over there he got into alot of shit had not many friends. Then by the end before he was going to move he calmed down a bit and ended up being friends with this girl. 

In the beginning of us dating he would bring her up a lot by showing me pictures she‚Äôd send him of her cute animals. He never would mention her name or anything just say ‚Äúthey‚Äù. One day I got very annoyed and asked is this person non-binary or what why do you keep saying they? She wasn‚Äôt. I openly talk about my guy friends so it just seemed weird to me. 

I ask why he says they for her but for guy friends he uses proper pronouns. He said he didn‚Äôt realize he was doing it it was just bc his ex didn‚Äôt like that he‚Äôs friends with her. I ask why and he said it‚Äôs because his ex didn‚Äôt like how close him and his friend are. I asked if him and his friend ever had anything more than just friend and he said that she‚Äôs pretty and all but it never turned into anything more than friends. He told me that they did flirt a lot when they first met, and the most that ever happened was them cuddling and watching a movie..  idk he had only known her for a few months so. 

He also told me that his ex found out how close they were by going on his phone and seeing but apparently she never said what bothered her. I also found out that while he was dating his ex he had to go back to Arizona for a week to get something done and apparently he spent most of his time with his friend. He said his ex got upset because he‚Äôd barley respond since he was busy with this friend and missed them. He said he was staying at a hotel alone and the only time his friend went into the hotel was to do his hair since she‚Äôs a hair dresser. 

He mention she has a cool niche hobby and later on he says he wants to get into a hobby like that. She sends a corny video she made that idk I don‚Äôt find funny then he sends it to me laughing saying how funny it is. I‚Äôm kinda starting to think I should just keep my distance now.

"Dating advice Hello people , i hope you all having a great day !

I met this cute girl from instagram and she was near me so we had a chat and i decided to ask her out and we went on a date yesterday , she looked shy at first but we had some nice conversations , i was really hearing her out and i was excited to listen to her..

In these last months im in a need to meet a new person and find something serious and i felt something with her yesterday, im so anxious and her way of talking made me calm and relaxed.. Well , the problem is that as a text person she might reply after 12 hours or just read the message and reply after hours again.. This kinda make me feel like she isnt interested at all , the thing is whenever we actually chat she replies with a decent message and doesnt seem like she is lazy replying.. am i just insecure?

(Just to clarify she told me she dont use the phone much but she is actually always online )

and she has problem socializing ",Maleficent-Target205,1,1690808838.0,1.0,969,196,969
"Discussed Exclusivity and Nothing Changed?? (M24) (F25) Hi,

I‚Äôm a little lost in my current relationship and would love advice. I‚Äôve been dating a woman for several months and the dates have been wonderful. She has initiated several, and finally we discussed exclusively seeing each other at the end of our last date. She said yes, but her behavior makes me question myself.

She never initiates conversation about how I am. I see her online, but I don‚Äôt seem to be a priority.  She never continues conversations, and if she doesn‚Äôt like a question I ask her she won‚Äôt answer at all. 

I don‚Äôt know if I see the label of boyfriend/girlfriend to mean something different from her? I know I‚Äôve only been seeing this lady for a couple months, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that a woman that is interested in a man romantically would like to see or talk with him more than once a week? Or at the very least check in on him? I try to check in once a day as I believe that is what it means to care about someone in a relationship, but this situation is making me really question my perspective. I‚Äôm really lost.

I broke up with my ex as well, and Im not sure if my ex wants to watch Coldplay with me or not as well. Hence, I told him he could go with me if he wants. He asked about if I bought it from the web, and told me about situation, and added if its ok with my ex if he goes with me. I just replied ""yes I bought the ticket from web"" but I didnt reply the rest of his text. He didnt reply until now, which is already 2 days. Not even chat me about anything.

"Dating a massage therapist I'm (25m)not sure if I'm alright with being with a woman(24f) who is a massage therapist.

I have been dating a nearly perfect woman. She has a wonderful personality, she's kind, attractive, makes me feel great just interacting with her, I have had good interactions with her family and she with mine. We both haven't slept with anyone because we are waiting for marriage, however, we have kissed a lot and been physical. She doesn't yell or escalate arguments, which I really love about her. I really like her but I just don't like the idea of her touching strangers on a regular basis, mostly because she is a massage therapist. I know it's stupid to take it so seriously but I really do think of physical touch as being something special. She has said so too. I'm going to bring this topic up with her tomorrow while trying to be a gentle as I can so I don't upset her. The last thing I want is to make her cry over something like this. She is a sensitive person as I've noticed interacting with her, it's another reason I like her so much. 

I'm having a hard time with this because I've been considering my future with this woman. It's just hard to think of her massaging other people. I know it's a health profession but I don't know. Am I being too unreasonable? I do plan to bring this up with her, any suggestions on how to do so without upsetting her? She's been very honest with me but I can tell she is very sensitive so I really don't want to make her feel awful just because of her work. It's not like she is doing anything wrong, it's just my own maybe you could call it jealousy. It's hard for me to think of her touching other men. 

She's told me she doesn't want to change me. I don't want to change her either, she really is so great. I just don't know if I can take thinking about her touching other men on a regular basis. I especially don't want to hurt her by saying something stupid about what is just a job. I really don't know what to do.

"Did he ever like me or did he just use me I had a bad dating experience a year ago and I‚Äôve largely gotten over it but occasionally it flares up especially when I meet new people, so I want some help to process it. 

Long story short, a guy I met on hinge fervently pursued me/love-bombed me for a week (constant text messages) after the first date (we had good chemistry on the first date). On the second date I was a little tipsy and the circumstances lent to a very romantic environment and one thing led to another and we had sex (although going into the date I never thought we‚Äôd end up having sex). This was on a Friday. 

Guy was still attentive over the weekend, but he tried several times to come over to my place on Monday and I refused. He claimed to be super busy at work that week, and the texting frequency started to drop quite a bit. On Wednesday he spontaneously called me while I was watching a movie at home, and I let him come over this time; we ended up having sex again. He didn‚Äôt stay over. 

Then, no texts at all for the following two days, until he called me on Friday to say he‚Äôs been busy at work but he‚Äôll think of me when he thinks of sth fun. That just sounded weird, so I sent him a text after the call to point out how much his effort dropped after he got sex. To this, he responded that he felt I was a little entitled and he wanted to take a break. Obviously now he was just trying to gaslight me and pump and dump.

I never reply and unmatch him on the dating app.

Funny twist is, 6 months later he send me several super long texts, saying that it was his birthday today and while celebrating with friends at a certain expensive restaurant (he named the restaurant) a conversation topic came up that reminded him of me. He apologized for not managing stress well/not treating me right, and hoped that someone was treating me like the queen I was (lolol!!!)

My gut feeling about his texts is, he either wanted to absolve his conscience of any guilt by being some closure to this, or he wanted to see if he could rekindle things with m perhaps after months of dating new people he realized I was the best he ever got, or maybe he just got horny and wanted to see if I might fall into his trap and have sex with him again.

Some more information: 1) he claimed to want a long-term relationship on his dating profile, 2)although he constantly texted for 4 days after the first date, he didn‚Äôt make plans to ask me out until I prompted him, 3) he made some casual flirty comments (in texting and on the second date) that seemed innocent and just flirty at the time but actually had a very sexual undertone when I reflected on things afterwards

My question is, it‚Äôs pretty clear he just used looking for LTR and love-bombing me as a way to get sex, but why he he text me 6 months later? I do think the most likely answer, although extremely disgusting to think about, is that he wanted to see if I would still be available for sex. But why did he do it on his birthday (I know it‚Äôs his real birthday)?

"Exhausted of being single Does anyone else feel this way? I'm completely exhausted of being single. I'm tired of not having someone to share my life with.

I've done everything I'm supposed to do, focused on my career, now people are intimidated by my job, filled my life with a few hobbies, but the men I'm meeting seem to not have any, I'm putting myself out there on the apps but I don't seem to meet anyone who wants something serious with me.

"Seeing a guy for four months, he said he loved me and now is changing his hinge location daily on his vacation. What to do? Title kinda says it all

I‚Äôve been seeing a guy for four months, who I have known casually as an acquaintance for years.
He expressed early on he was very excited to be seeing me and that he finally had a chance etc.

I am slow to enter relationships so I was very happy to take it slow and keep seeing other people.

Then a few weeks before he left on this vacation he told me he loved me. We were not in an exclusive situation at that point and I was shocked by this. I don‚Äôt love him as I‚Äôve only been seeing him a few months at this point but I say I like him a lot. But he made no attempt to make things exclusive and I was okay as I am fine with something more casual, but it was confusing.

Anyways, I go to look at his hinge profile and he had changed it to the location he was going for vacation and has continued to do so as he travels.

I was in no rush to get into anything, but this behaviour is off putting and making me feel confused, coming weeks after he said he loved me.

I would have considered something long term with him before this but now he feels untrustworthy with his words (him loving me) not matching his actions (changing his hinge stuff)

I can‚Äôt decide if I talk about this with him or just clock this as a summer fling and move on because his behaviour isn‚Äôt really giving long term material? Or does this make sense after he told me he loved me and then it wasn‚Äôt reciprocated and he‚Äôs just trying to slow down?

"Breakup and new girl I am 25 years old. Nine of last ten years i was in relafionships. Three of them were pretty long - 2 years, 2 years and last one was 4 years and i was living with this girl in one apartment for 3.5 years. She broke with me 6 months ago. 

I learned a lot from that and i dont blame her. I was good boyfriend but made some mistakes and got too comfortable at some point. I am sure that we will never be together again, even if she would want to. I dont know if I ever be fully over it - we both stepped in adulthood together, learned a lot of things and had kinda special connection I think. Breakup made me kinda different person, but busides that i party a lot since then it was change for good. It made me trully confident and I am for first time in my life able to fully control my emotions and got my true self back. For whole life I was guy that belevied in true romance and I think for now I kinda lost that and I am more realistic. It hurts to accept new reality, but I am fine with that. I think i got my shit together as a man and I am on right life path.


For the past months I flirted with a lot of girls, slept with 4 ones. I am pretty attractive men and never had problems with girls. But lastly I got to conclusion that pursuing with girls that i know I dont want to be with in long term relationship is pointless as I quickly lose interest in them. I got big thing for high inteligence in girl and I care about that even more than looks - some girls that were unatractive for me from start and then i noticed their Intelligence turned to be hot as fuck for me. 

Two months ago i met a girl that is in unhappy relationship, this is her first guy and she is with him for 4 years but from what I noticed she is scared to leave him, she is 22 years old. From the start we both clicked very hard and I rarely view girls as relationship meterial. It never got physical and month ago we decided to take a break from each other. I think she is still in relationship with this guy - she is kinda scared of me beacause i gave her player vibes as there were a lot of women around me when we met. I know this is red flag, but my intuition which rarely lets me down tells me to take that risk.

As I stated before party a lot recently and I know I wont stop untill i will have someone that i will truly want to take care of. Constant partying is not in line with my fitness and life goals, but there is really no way for me to stop it when I am single, i really know that part of myself. I think in next weeks I will decide to contact her again. I dont think if it works it will be rebound relafionship but I am not sure as I stated before my whole life I was jumping from relationship to relationship.

"Men, I'd like to hear your opinion My name is Kira, and this is the story of how my life took an unexpected turn. I've always been a slim girl, and it was something I never paid much attention to until I met Alex. He was charming, and we quickly fell in love, seemingly perfect for each other. Little did I know that my body would become a source of heartache in our relationship.  
At first, Alex never mentioned anything about my weight. We were happy, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. But as time went on, I started to notice him acting distant. He would make subtle comments about my appearance, hinting that I should gain weight. I brushed it off initially, thinking he was just concerned about my health.  
One evening, as we were sitting in a park, the sun setting behind us, Alex finally gathered the courage to talk about what was bothering him. His words struck me like a dagger to the heart.  
""Kira, I've been thinking a lot lately,"" he began hesitantly. ""I care about you, but I can't help feeling like you're just too skinny. It's hard for me to see us having a future together like this.""  
Tears welled up in my eyes, and I tried to hold back the pain that was bubbling inside me. I couldn't believe that my body, something I had no control over, could be a reason for someone to break my heart.  
""You mean you're breaking up with me because I'm too skinny?"" I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion.  
""I just don't think we're compatible in that aspect,"" he replied, his voice gentle but unwavering.  
Feeling a mix of anger and sadness, I stood up, looking at him with a newfound determination. ""You know what, Alex? I refuse to let anyone dictate how I should look or feel about my body. If you can't accept me for who I am, then maybe it's best we go our separate ways.""  
And with that, I walked away, leaving Alex behind with his shallow beliefs. In the days that followed, I struggled to come to terms with the end of our relationship. But gradually, I began to find my strength again.  
I surrounded myself with supportive friends and family who reminded me that I was perfect just the way I was. I focused on my passions, my dreams, and found joy in activities that made me happy. Most importantly, I learned to love myself, flaws and all.  
As time passed, I realized that Alex's rejection had been a blessing in disguise. It had taught me to value myself and to never compromise my self-worth for anyone else's approval. I began to see my body as a symbol of resilience and strength, not a flaw to be fixed.  
And as fate would have it, in the most unexpected moment, I met someone new. A person who embraced me for who I was, who saw beauty in my uniqueness, and cherished me without trying to change me.  
Looking back, I am grateful for the pain I endured because it led me to a greater understanding of myself. I am no longer defined by someone else's standards of beauty. I am Kira, a strong and confident woman, loving myself just the way I am. And that is a love that no one can take away from me.",KiraRai69,1,1690660777.0,0.67,3049,565,3049

"Advice moving forward. Hello,

So I am thinking about deleting Tinder and Hinge. It does not seem to be going anywhere. Unfortunately, the men on these apps (from the 30+ I have gone out with at least) don't have much depth to them, just want sex, are super shy, lie, or have massive egos. I am just saying this about the guys I have gone out with on these apps not men in general. 

I like to talk about intellectual topics (science, history, philosophy etc.), but I can not seem to find guys that are intellectual on these apps despite the fact that many claim to be intellectual.

I still want to date, however I attend a really small university that has a 7 girls to one guy ratio. Most of the guys are taken which is fine and I am happy for them.

I am premed and I try to do premed internships. However, there are very few men in these internships. The majority of which are taken. 

My hometown has a population of about 3,700 people so not much luck here unfortunately.

We spoke today at my apartment. And she was very, very fiery to say the least. 
When I saw the look her face. I knew it was going to be combative and it was going to be excruciating at times. 

For the first 10mins she just spoke quite angrily that I didn't show much in her opinion that I reciprocated her. Unfortunately she kept talking over me and cutting me off. I couldn't get a word in to explain. She loved getting the last word over me so I just let her have her Monologue. She spoke quite belligerent to be honest. It wasn't nice to hear. But I listened. And took on board the criticism leaved at me.

She then asks me directly. Do I even like her?
And I tell her that I am but I want to take things very, very casually. Then of course she fucking cuts me off and this really, really fucks me off. To segment things a say and not listen to Me in my entirely is unfair. I raise my voice and not word for word but I tell in essence to fuck off if she won't give me the opportunity/courtesy of speaking. Thankfully she listens. Finally. 

I explain that I didn't feel comfortable reciprocating her touching me and talking about sex given she was drunk. And she surprisingly said she wasn't exactly drunk which I didn't bothering arguing with her about since she was being templemental so I just essentially said I wasn't being rude or ignoring her. I just didn't think she was being serious when she said she wanted sex. She says it was obvious that it was Ok. 

We then talked about a few things and she asks me is it an 'issue that she's a virgin'?

And looking back. Not saying my spine turned to jelly but I probably should have been more forthright in my response. 

I told her 'not really'. But I'd happily have sex with her. I joke about make up sex being the best sex and she laughs which help elevate the mood. I then joke about being the sexist man alive which again gets a funny response and makes me feel lighter about everything.

I explain to her that I want to take things day by day. I tell we are still a huge way off boyfriend and girlfriend. Which she thankfully understood. She then tells me she's not seeing anyone or even speaking. Which I find encouraging.

She tells me she's happy after talking and that we should take a few days break of talking and 'definitely see each other again'. I tell her I agree. We then embrace and I plant a kiss on her left cheek. I then walk her out and say bye. She then audaciously give me a full on quick kiss on my lips as she leaves the main apartment building. I just laugh. You couldn't write itü§£üôà. Quite cheeky. Even hours later I'm still questioning if that actually happened! 

 And that's that. I feel like someone hit me with a baseball bat mid sleep. But there's a understanding now. And that's crucial.

Obviously I didn't like the shouting and vitriol from her. But she got her point across.",Formal-Crab-181,1,1690656448.0,0.6,3631,686,3631
"dating a poli person Edit: here is some important context i forgot and it‚Äôs probably helpful:
-Im 20f and he is 18m, he was my first everything and knew much more about sex then i did
-We are in a long distance relationship but the person i mention in the post lives in the same city has him.

Im dating a polyamory person and i think i am monogamous but i do like him a lot‚Ä¶
Sometimes he tells me about the other people he kisses or has dates with and sometimes im jealous or insecure which i think affects him‚Ä¶ so i try to find a way to be supportive, i really like him.
Also im fat and i have a lot of insecurities around that and he has always has been very careful and respectful of that during intimate times and i know it really bothers him because he said he would like to see my body and those kind of things. I always ask that we‚Äôre in the dark soo i can feel more comfortable‚Ä¶
one of this days he just told me about some on he me and he said he would like to be in a date with them‚Ä¶ he showed pictures of that person and everything after they met and told me how this person was soo skinny and he found it cute because he could just throw them around and ‚Äúhold them by the waist‚Äù and it felt so good (the last particularly hurted me because i‚Äôve told him i like to be hug/touched in that specific place but he doesn‚Äôt do it a lot with me).
i just feel bad‚Ä¶ i dont know if im just jelaous but i fear he might like this person more‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen photos of them and they are prettier and skinnier and for what i see their intimate life works very well too and i think he cant do those things with me because im fat maybe? 
i dont know‚Ä¶ i felt like venting but if some has any advice, ill take it :)",OboeWanCannolli,1,1690257584.0,1.0,1703,348,1703

"I (25F) didn‚Äôt back off when the guy (27M) told me he‚Äôs a virgin, but for other reasons‚Ä¶ So I met this guy at a friends‚Äô hangout and I felt like getting to know him more. We were talking a lot and was making future plans to hang out, and we ended up going out for 3 times after that. My friend told me that he might be a virgin so I asked him in a joking way and he confirmed. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal for me since he comes from a religious country and I‚Äôm not someone who see sex as an important part in dating necessarily, but what happened next was a complete turned off for me. 

The main thing is that he doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the first time I met him this red flag was already showing up but I didn‚Äôt care about it- we went to a club with my other friends and because of the loud music I had to type on my phone and show my friends in order to communicate. Sometimes certain messages is only for certain friends, but this guy will come and look at what I‚Äôm typing every time. Even if I‚Äôm intentionally facing him with the back of my phone he‚Äôll still walk around and look at my phone. 

It also shows in other aspects. He asked if I can put his gym bag in my apt before we go out and every time he‚Äôll follow me upstairs and stand right in front my door when I open it even when I told him I can‚Äôt invite him in the house. The last time when we hang out with our friends, we were taking about something and the topic went to Instagram followers and he asked me what I consider good Instagram followings so I checked his followings in front of him jokingly, and turns out half of his 4000 followings are only fans creators with a very explicit page, and he‚Äôs actively liking a lot of their posts. One of the creators, specifically creates contents about accidentally showing her underwear.

That was a big turn off for me so the next day when he texted me I told him that we are friends and rejected his invitation of working out the second day (with a direct nah I‚Äôll pass). However the second day he sent me about 10 texts in the morning telling me that I need to show up on time and in the end was upset that I didn‚Äôt go. I didn‚Äôt reply because I was being clear. He then sent me 2 reels on Instagram before calling me 2 times at night saying that he‚Äôs worried about me because I don‚Äôt answer. I didn‚Äôt answer because there‚Äôs nothing important. He then texted 2 of my friends asking where I am and that he‚Äôs worried about me. That‚Äôs when I had to send him a long text saying that I just see him as a friend and doesn‚Äôt reciprocate his feelings. He told me he‚Äôs sorry about his actions the second day but is still trying to ask me out. 

I‚Äôve only known this guy for 2 weeks at this point and we‚Äôve only hang out 4 times. This is too much.",gg5588e,1,1690660467.0,0.67,2774,550,2774

"Nut sure how to find women I'm on the autistic spectrum and my interactions face to face are always awkward as I seem to have weird mannerisms. 20 years ago (I'm almost 35 now) I managed by meeting girls through forums/chat rooms so that we could develop a certain level of trust over a few months before actually committing to a relationship and seeing each other's faces.

Nowadays, this isn't ideal any more, women are tired of being pestered online and it's more common to rely on apps specifically designed for dates. My problem with this is that I don't really have interesting photos of myself simply because I don't like getting my picture taken and thus got nothing for those kinds of apps. Not only that, my personal style is not something that women nowadays like and thus if the first impression they get is my face, there's a high chance they'll just not be interested.

Now, of course, a solution would be to fix u my looks so that that they match the current fashion trends, but I'm just not that kind of person. I am the kind of person who likes wearing his hair really long, and wear shirts and jeans everywhere, and I feel comfortable being a skelly. It's what I'm used to seeing in the mirror and have no desire to change that.

I've tried anonymous boards, but everybody there seems to be under 25 which would just not be appropriate.

"I should have asked my crush for his number I (17f) and my crush (17m) went to a sports camp last week where people from around my city can practice sports together for one week. On the first day I noticed this really cute looking guy, let‚Äôs call him X. X was being very kind the whole camp so I thought to ask for his number before the camp ended. I was going to ask for his NUMBER on Tuesday, one day before the whole practice thing would be over. When Tuesday finally came, I got too nervous to ask him for anything so I just thought it would be better to do it the next day so incase he rejects me, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Well Friday rolled around and after practice was over, I got nervous again but sucked it up and asked, the only problem was is that I asked for his Snap and not his number out of anxiety. I got his Snap but after, I realized he‚Äôs never on it, so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to ever talk. I regret not asking for his number instead because he probably would have given it to me, but we do share the same sports coach for private lessons. I‚Äôm thinking of asking my coach if X will ever do another lesson so I could go, or just asking my coach straight out for X‚Äôs number, but would that be too much? I don‚Äôt know if I should just let this go or ask anything from my coach. Advice?",RealityHistorical764,1,1690248400.0,1.0,1293,260,1293

"Is he not that into me.....long vent *update I last texted him I couldn't text and if we could talk later...he never responded and has put no further effort....

I've been talking to this guy for a bit. He is out of state for the next few weeks. We are not being intimate or kissing. We just cuddle hold hands and I spend the night sometimes...which I think has led to me having more feelings for him. He says he wants to take things slow and the next person he is intimate with is someone he wants to be in a relationship with and get married to....I honestly don't really talk to anyone else and have also been abstinent for over a year...so to me it is awesome to not have someone pressuring me or feeling like they just want me for one thing... I do struggle with anxiety and sometimes over think on his actions.  He will text me and respond back to me hours or days after. I sent him a message about how I felt this was making me feel. I want to believe he has good intentions but also feel like he's gaslighting me...he took a defense mode stating how I take a long time to respond too and how he understands I'm busy as is he and to not over think it, and please be understanding. He is away for work and stated to ""Realize this because you are going to ruin this before we even have a chance"". He did state he is so overwhelmed and just needs my love and support...


I will add that while he is too busy to respond example once he took 2 days to respond he somehow had time to post 4 pictures and 6 +stories on social mediaüòè 

I feel when we hang out he is so sweet and caring...but texting is so dry and distant.  Am I being to needy in thinking it's rude and giving off not into u vibes by him taking as long as he does to text?",Opposite-Swing6555,1,1690249254.0,0.99,1739,345,1739

"M22 needs advice on how to start letting intimacy happen M22 yo University Student here.
So I have no experience with intimacy. I have no problem with talking to girls and strangers generally I think people think I am quite charismatic at first so its not some social anxiety thing. I know how to start a convo and I think I am an interesting guy to talk to. But only as long as its not about myself. I will talk to you about Ww2, Aldous Huxley, JWST or the physics behind nuclear fusion. I love good deep conversations about things but just not me. I dont consider my emotions to be valid and important. I dont understand it well when people want to be closer to me. I dont know how to act but I consider myself a pretty confident guy in all other regards. Ive been working out for multiple years and I'm tall so like Im comfortable in my skin as long as the matter on hand arent my emotions.

I never valued intimacy really as I always found emotions a bit annoying and more of a chore than something that makes life fun. It always seemed to me that the girls I was into never were into me. I dont blame them I was a mess for most of my life.

My life changed significantly last year when I moved and found a lot of new friends and people to do things with. I became much better at socialskills and got confident. We go to festivals, parties, raves etc and I'm having a ton of fun. With this naturally comes girls. I noticed that there are quite a few girls in our groups that I think are really attractive. One girl specifically I got closer with a bit recently. I know her via my best friend. I think he dated her at some point but now shes really just part of the friendgroup as my friend has another gf.

I had seen her a few times. She made it pretty obvious I think. Dancing in front of me. Constantly smiling at me. Seeking eye contact. Following me on parties, after hugs letting her hands rest on me. Anyways on a party recently I saw her and we talked and eventually it got late and for some reason she really liked to touch me. Like she wanted to hug me all the time and snuggle next to me. She was quite drunk and I kindof ""looked out for her"" a bit. She said how nice this and and how much she likes my body as its so warm. She is what one would consider ""petite"" and I'm over 10 inches taller than her and 60+ lbs heavier so idk if its weird that I have some ""protect her"" feelings but I know shes been sexually assaulted by strangers before and she is really delicate so like idk. I feel responsible somehow. She definetly enjoyed resting her head on my chest. I think she really likes me and I like her too. At some point when we had to stop hugging as my arm slid off hers out hands met and we held hands and interlocked fingers for what felt like an eternity okay so like Im sure she likes me and I do too. 

Now recently I realised something. I dont know what to do next. Like Ive never been around someone that I like that also likes me back really. Im really bad at showing my feelings and Im known to be ""cold and cynical"" at times. For some reason I dont want to text her. Idk why. Im so afraid of being weird and I just know what its like to be disliked and I reject affection regularly. My family for example I hate it when my mum goes off over how much she loves me. Or even my cats. When they come to me and start purring and jumping on me and laying down and rubbing their heads against me. I feel so undeserving of love generally. I dont want love because it makes no sense but man it feels so good when a girl you like puts her hands on you. Like a wave of warmth that you dont want to let go of.

 I realise how the friendzone works and how it punishes inaction but idk wtf to do. Its not just her. Theres multiple girls that I think like me and I like too but idk wtf to do as it always feels weird and inappropriate for me to be intimate with others idk wtf Im scared of. Like im so scared of how powerful the emotions are and I hate how incompetent I am so I just avoid it. Intimacy is one of those things that I cant just ""prepare for"" like an exam. It only comes with experience and I have none and I hate that. Im competent in physical exercise. Im good in Uni, I read a lot. I think Im at least somewhat educated and can talk about almost anything with people. Im openminded, I like to do drugs occasionally, I love all my friends, Im having fun so like I like my life but im so incredibly inexperienced in this one domain called Intimacy. I think if I had any experience I would end up trying to be competent in that too and be sufficient and capeable. But from my current position idk what to do lol",squarecorner_288,1,1690250564.0,1.0,4641,920,4641

"I think the guy I‚Äôm supposed to go on a date with tomorrow has a girlfriend. Should I ask her?

He told me he got out of a relationship awhile ago and that they ‚Äújust drifted apart‚Äù. 

Before I go out with any guy I always like to look them up on social media just to make sure there are no glaring red flags. Well, during my search I ended up finding some pretty recent pictures of him and this girl, they‚Äôre clearly a couple (there‚Äôs an anniversary post from January of this year).

"I am terrible at showing affection or expressing my emotions, and I'm scared I might ruin my relationship. I've only been dating my current girlfriend for a month now, but I'm completely in love with her. I get excited every time I see her, and I love every minute we hang out or go on dates.

On our third date, when I made things official, she told me a little more about her perspective about the relationship. She's been interested in me for a while, since we first met, and every time we make plans, she always tells me that she's fine with anything, as long as we're together.

The problem arose around last week, when we went out for coffee. I had met her parents just before, and I got along very well with her whole family; however, when we got coffee, she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that I always seem emotionally distant. She also told me that she didn't know if I really liked her, and that I never talk about how I feel.

Growing up, I never showed or received much affection from anyone. I had trouble socializing with people, and I never really had the chance to talk about my feelings, so I learned to just keep everything to myself. I have a habit of bottling up my emotions, and not asking for help with anything. If ever anyone does ask me whats wrong, I just say ""I'm fine"" and move on. I've never told anyone I loved them, and I haven't hugged anyone in about 10 years, including family members. 

This has made many people angry with me, and I tend to not really care, until I met my current girlfriend. I want to tell her that I love her, but I don't know how.

"Have I been played? I'm a 17F and talking to the 17M i met approximately 4 months ago.

You keep saying he. Basically, she confessed that she was talking to guys only at the end before she left that woman's house. They were supposedly walking in as she was leaving and they over heard her talking about anime. She got extremely mad at me for asking who's he and how everything happen with he and started screaming at me, saying I ruined her night and she was so happy. Also she said she told them that im a big anime watcher so they know she was with someone but only after i asked questions. threaten me that she can't be with someone like me and that those are her new beasties. Something I learn about this new friend of hers she hangs out is that she goes to bars to pick up younger man and take them home. They even aperently pick up some guys at safeway that they remember from the bar(her new friends) And even today, she still trowing it to my face bringing it up, saying and getting mad at me and yelling at me, belittling me and threatening me with leaving and breaking my stuff or pc- I'm a gamer. 

Little more about me. I'm extremely patient and I try to speak with care and understanding now I do suspect that maybe she's heading towards mania. Last year when this happen she started to be  narsaccist- bunch of gas lighting and I thought it could he because of stress and being drugged by people she trusted.
 The reason why I am talking about this is because 

1. vent. 
2.you guys might have pointers in what direction I might take since there's wiser people out.

I did like one thing- she kept updating me and calling me throughout the day at the bar which I find weird- even call me if she can talk to a guy who was autistic and in a wheelchair.  but the only thing I asked her to do was to let me know when she got to said places fine with a address incase something happens to her. 

She did call me and invited me to come at like 2am when I was asleep and need to get up early at 6am. 

Also we agreed she was going to ask her docs if she can drink with taking meds for her bipolar. Which she never did when I asked her today.

Update for people who don't know the past and / or what's bipolar. There are different kinds, but one of them is hypermedia.

One. Her due to trust issues. But it's not even me either her whole family and the docs/ therapist tell her that she shouldn't be going out late nights or partying. She has a history of hyper mania. If you don't know what that is. Imagine this. She feels like she's God. She can walk in the street in front of cars. Fight people or even beat up her own family. And or one time, she said she was on fire in the middle of the street burning. When it was all on her head. 6 months straight of this. Being in the streets being raped
 Beat up and traumatized all because she wanted to have fun and smoked some weed, which was laced and trusted a dude. A drug that made her go into a mania episode. I wish it would be a week or a month, but no. I had to leave my job to go find her in the streets day and night. She kept getting out of the mental hospital because they thought she was just a druggy I had to fight with court to make her owned by the state, so she gets forced treatment. I'm just referring to why I'm a bit off. BTW, she just told me I'm not allowed to go bars because I could do something out of spite. Wtf???? I'm not even mad at her , nor have I brought up.convo again, so because she goes to bars, I can't go still........",DefiantAnalysis182,1,1690794475.0,0.6,4425,872,4425

"What's a dude gotta do to get a GF? I'm honestly at a loss, and no this is not a troll post.

Stats (listing these just to show, on paper, I *shouldn't* be undesirable):

25m

Bench 250 (just to show I'm fit)

Very high net worth (you'd never know by my lifestyle though)

100k salary (you'd never know by my job title)

Most people would agree I'm between a 6 and 8 out of 10 facially... most likely about 7.5 (aka pretty attractive but not a model or anything. Noticeably good-looking, though)

Really charismatic/funny but in a non-standard sort of way... like I'm very witty and intelligent and a bit quirky, kind of ""march to my own drum""

**The Problem:**

My job makes it so that socializing is tough. While I only work 30 hours per week, these hours are from 3am-9am, a.k.a. GL ever socializing with anyone with a traditional schedule because I sleep at 8PM. That, coupled with the fact I live in an area I know zero people, and I've pretty much consigned myself to only using online dating; I do go out on Saturday nights, but I don't really want to meet my future GF/Wife at a club. I'm not an anti-social person, either--in college I had a ton of friends--I just *can't* do that anymore.

Plus, a lot of my strong ""pull"" traits don't come across. Women like a guy financially set; while I am extremely set, my job title makes me seem poor. My living situation doesn't reflect my ""actual worth"" either, and I don't take fancy vacations or drive a luxury vehicle. I'm not interested in changing any of these things--outside of no dating life, my set-up is extremely ideal for what I want out of life. No stress, basically work part-time, pension after 20 years, and my investments will grow to some pretty massive numbers to create generational wealth by time I'm old.

But on online dating, while I do get a lot of matches, these girls just invest zero time in getting to know me. The only ones who do invest time getting to know me are, and I'm not trying to be a dick, but ones who just aren't in my league whatsoever. Like, again, not being a dick, but... I'm fit, attractive, make 6 figures, wealthy, and intelligent--I don't have much in common with a fat girl with tattoos all over her body and no job. There's also girls who just want a quick smash--I've had sex with two girls the last two months, and they weren't ugly, but that also wasn't ""dating"" whatsoever. 

So, how the hell do you actually date? I had a GF in college, but post-college it seems impossible. I don't meet enough women. I feel like the normal advice is something akin to ""level up,"" but really, I feel like I'm at the point of diminishing returns there. And still nobody remotely \~suitable\~ really shows significant interest. What do?",NicotineHater69,1,1690663604.0,1.0,2726,495,2726
"Does a girl at work (20f) like me (20m) or am I overthinking everything? How do I determine her level of interest? 

I (20m) work with a lot of people my age at a swim and racquet club. Last week I needed to get something for my boss from these two blonde twins (20f) and somehow they knew my (nick)name (keep in mind this job just started and there had been no previous interaction). They said they knew it because they heard through the grapevine. I found that odd and began to become curious. Later on in the parking garage, I saw them and as I was getting in my car they said goodbye and I commented how I found it odd that they found out my name (sarcastically) and one mentioned to the other how I still didn‚Äôt know hers. Yes I should‚Äôve asked but the place was packed and I needed to leave, idiot. For the past week if I would walk by them at the check in area they‚Äôd smile and wave. However, there have not been many opportunities to talk as were all busy and work in completely different areas of the club. Yesterday, I asked one of them if she knew what time we would have to move cones, she said yes in a sarcastic way (didn‚Äôt tell me the actual time) and was giggling. I walked away and said well that‚Äôs nice (again sarcastically). So far that is all that‚Äôs happened and I do not work on mondays so I didn‚Äôt see them but something in my gut tells me that the twin with the brown eyes is into me but I am just not sure.

"Matched with someone from my high school but we don't remember each other About 2 weeks ago i matched (on bumble) with a guy and the conversation died out pretty quickly. Fast forward a week ago, i was bored and scrolling on instagram, and found his account, i realised we had quite a lot of mutual followers and most of them were from my co-ed cheerleading team, save for a couple of cheerleaders i met outside of my high school.  
I decided to hit him up on bumble on Monday and ask if he was a cheerleader, and he confirmed it. We then realise that we were both from the same high school and same team but he was 2 years my senior, there were pictures on instagram where both of us were in it, just on different ends of the photograph. Had a good laugh because neither of us recognised or remembered each other, but to be fair, it has been 6 years since leaving cheer and i think both of us looked quite different since. I was also quite introverted and quiet, and he said he was pretty lowkey back then as well. We also don't follow each other on instagram.  
We texted a little everyday since but he hasn't responded to me since the weekend (2 days ago). Kind of bummed out because i was hoping we could've met and thought it would be a funny story or at least interesting to see if we would get along or be awkward, given our ""history"".

"Relationship problems Me (21F) have been in a relationship with my partner (21M) for almost a year now. We are very different in many ways, he is more extroverted and I am very introverted. I would say overall that our relationship has been pretty good. 

However I can't help but worry that we might be too different, he is of more conservative values and I'm more open minded with how you dress, what you do and stuff... generelly. So sometimes I feel like the things I want to do in life is without his support nor understanding. And lately the things he's saying and doing really upsets me. 

First of all he is white and uses the n-word a lot especially when we are with his family. I don't think he means it in a harmful way towards black people but still I cringe every time he says it, cause I feel like it is wrong for us to use it and especially so casually. I just don't know how to bring it up when we're alone and how to confront about it without calling him racist. 

Another thing is how he has been with other girls when we are out and drinking. He is always touching some other girl (on the back or shoulders) and to me it just seems unnecessary. Like I understand that he is more social and likes to interact with people and be friendly, but the touching really makes me uncomfortable. I would only touch a guy like that if I was flirting and that is what I feel like he is doing.. flirting.. This is something I did mention to him one night when he was being extra flirty with a girl and I just had enough of it cause I felt like it was embarrassing for me as his partner to sit while he was constantly fishing for another girl's attention.

 He has promised to not act like that again and says that since I'm his first partner he doesn't know where the boundaries are at. But I really can't seem to let it go this time, it's like I don't trust him the way I used to do. 

Our sex life is also getting worse, cause lately I just don't have the desire for it. I'm still attracted to him but I just can't relax when we have sex. I'm also lying about getting orgasms cause he always ask about it and wants me to say when I get one, so I'm stressed about trying to orgasm instead of just being natural and just being in the moment... 

I know that we're over the honeymoon fase and sometimes we will disagree on things, but I shouldn't go around being annoyed and frustrated and worry about how he interact around other girls.

Point is: I came across her ig recently and don‚Äôt want to even request to follow her because I feel like that would be creepy in a way maybe. If I did follow her my intentions would be to hit her up and see what happens. Also my peer Joe I would feel like he might disprove of it?Sorry for long story just curious for feedback thank u all. üôè",Routine_Ad82,1,1690273429.0,1.0,1453,290,1453
"""Why are you so good to me?""- what does this text mean from GF- Red flag? She made that comment after i told her i want her to come over and she said she was really busy.I kinda just said ok and told her that it was the only time to see eachother before holidays.She acted busy and later we get texting and she said shes in a phase where I shouldn't take doesnt understand how she feels,and not to expect anything she says me.She said it's about her overall life .

I just assured her that I'm always there for her and then she said ""Why are you so good to me""

 For background- Started talking 6months ago/going out and started dating soon after.We are gf/bf ,exclusive in our early 20s .She had no relationship before this one.I think our relationship is abit slower than usual,she hasn't meet my parents or I haven't meet hers.We haven't been intimate either,just making-out and holding hands/hugging.

She sometimes really cold hearted and sometimes really fun and lovey.I feel like she struggles to commit to me/our relationship.We try to talk about everything but,she doesnt tell me everything. I always try to get to hangout,text her ,compliment her, give her flowers.We did have a point where she said she doesnt know how she feels about us,that she didn't know what to do in a relationship and kept saying she's doesnt know how's she feels but she can't lose me or doesnt want to let me go.",Glad-Mousse-7298,1,1690271203.0,0.67,1399,252,1399
"The idea of ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to date I don‚Äôt know what this post is going to be, a discussion, looking for opinions or just me trying to say something I can‚Äôt say anywhere else.

For a while now I have this idea of ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to date. I am 19, really introverted and was never interested in relationships, probably due to my shyness. 

I don‚Äôt have many friends and now in college/work (I‚Äôm doing dual studies) it‚Äôs not too much better. 

More often than not I feel lonely, and the thought of a relationship with someone you can share everything and having physical closeness just makes me‚Ä¶ happy I guess? Or more sad, since I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before.

This is just a thought that regularly comes into my head and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Just wanted to share my thoughts on here. What do you guys think?",_ser_michael_,1,1690646948.0,1.0,812,150,812
"What does the saying "" I don't date for 1 year or 3 years, I date for life, I date to get married "" even means ? I've heard this saying "" I don't date for 1 year or 3 years, I date for life, I date to get married "" a few times. And I've trouble understanding.

I mean as long as you're not looking for something casual, or that you're not for example in a place just for a few months and are looking for a casual partner just for the time you're there etc. you're automatically dating "" for life "" right ?

If a relationship lasts 1 year - 3 years, it's just because it didn't work out, I'm not sure anyone is looking to date for 3 years and stop.

"Still want to have sex with my ex after we broke up So basically, I(F21) broke up with my bf(M22) around 3 weeks ago. I felt like I was over him at that moment. We were still in love with each other at that point, I just didn't want to invest in that relationship anymore because I felt like our relationship would go nowhere because of some of his decision (I thought he was the one). We agreed on still being friends. 

I went on vacation for a week and intentionally ignored his text to get over him. However, when I returned to the city, my feeling for him got stronger. I texted him something like ‚ÄùI want us to cut off completely, be strangers after this month, so if you want, we can be a couple again or ‚Äùfriends‚Äù for the rest of the month‚Äù (deep down in me wanted him to pick being a couple again for the rest of the month, but he didn't)

About 2 days after the text, we video-called each other, and he suddenly got hard because he thought I was naked, so he came over and we had sex. After that, we agreed to be fwb for the rest of the month, but he said he wanted to set a boundary that we won't get too intimate, like kissing. I convinced him that I wanted to kiss. I feel like I only want it because I want us to be a couple again. (I'm on my period, so idk if the hormone changes have an impact on this)

Idk why but since then, I've been really horny for him (I've never felt like this before). Idk if that's normal after you break up with someone and still have feeling for them. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs hiding it, but for me, it feels like he‚Äôs over the relationship when I'm not, and I was the one call it off.

If anyone has ever been in the same situation. I need some advice. What should I do? I want to be with him, but I don't want to waste my time with him",sleepwfood,1,1690260167.0,0.67,1778,359,1778

"Am I moving on too quickly? Hi I'm f/23 I just got out of a 4¬Ω year relationship for about three month now. I'm someone who's pretty good with processing my emotion, during the relationship we had our ups and down but it was mostly down. Long story short about half a year before our relationship end I felt like I was already 'done' but was holding onto hopes of him changing so I stayed. So when we broke up (I just knew it was coming) of course I cried and I was sad but I wasn't completely distraught, I was fine after a week. Now fast forward to today I've been recently talking to a guy for a month now and he's genuinely I feel like is a great guy. In recent weeks he's been dropping hints to me the signal is CLEAR. I am happy, I really do like him, and I feel like I'm ready but I feel like my last relationship is holding me back? I guess, it felt like I'm moving on too fast and I feel horrible since it was an almost 5 years relationship too.

"My boyfriend stole my medication from me. 
Hello, I have ADHD and take Adderall. I got my new prescription today of 20 mg, because I have a very hard time focusing. It is severe. I normally have to wear ear plugs, with headphones, with brown noise to completely focus, and even then I can be distracted. I take adderall and it is helpful. I‚Äôm in the medical field so I constantly have to study everyday. It‚Äôs hard to do that with ADHD when focusing is such a big problem. I am also different medications for other reasons.  
I had some empty medication bottles on the TV stand - completely empty. Today, I opened my new adderall medication bottle, and I took a pill and left the bottle on the computer stand which is in the same room. I was gone the whole day studying and my boyfriend was home. 

Later today, I was looking for something and found that one of the empty bottles from the TV stand was in the dresser and it had two pills of my adderall medication. I was very confused, because I literally opened the bottle today and I never transferred any pills to another bottle - There was no point in doing that, it makes no sense. The two adderall pills were inside a whole different medication bottle. This medication bottle was specific for my bipolar II. This medication bottle was empty. Now, there were two adderall pills in the bottle.  

My boyfriend was there when I opened the bottle and stood there in confusion. I even asked him if he took these by any chance and he denied it. I didn‚Äôt want to pester it, but he saw how confused I was the whole time because I kept wondering how that happened. I didn‚Äôt want to keep pestering him because I didn‚Äôt want him to think I didn‚Äôt trust him, but it makes no sense for me to have put them there. Why would I transfer my adderall into an empty bottle for a whole different medication? And, specifically why two?  

I truly think he wanted to try them and took them without my permission. A part of me thinks I‚Äôm going crazy even though I obviously didn‚Äôt transfer anything. How is that logical of me to do? It isn‚Äôt. Do I think he stole them? Yes, and I feel awful thinking that way but it makes the most sense to me. Am I mad? Not mad, but disappointed.  

He knows how important these medications are for me. I only get a thirty day supply. I'm a student who is in an intense field and needs them to focus. I struggle so much with focusing. He doesn‚Äôt study. He works. He doesn‚Äôt have ADHD. He's not on any medications. Adderall is one of those drugs that people love to try and abuse. People make money selling it. It took me a little over a year to be prescribed adderall due to this reason. I tried countless medications, all with severe side effects, and for some reason, adderall was the best fit for me. I don‚Äôt appreciate this at all. A part of me doesn‚Äôt want to believe he did this, but then it makes me go crazy. Then, I start wondering if I did something with it. I get fixated on the whole thing. I know I didn't transfer anything. It wouldn't make any sense for me to do that.   

This was a VERY inconsiderate and selfish thing to do. I know deep down he tried to steal them. But, how do I get him to admit that he did? I don‚Äôt want to come off as too strong since I genuinely want to discuss this with him and why it‚Äôs upsetting. But, how can I do that if he doesn‚Äôt admit to it? I want to ask him in a way where he won‚Äôt feel as if I am attacking him, because then I doubt he will ever admit to it. I would really love to sit down and talk about this, because this is concerning. But, I can't talk to him about it if he does not admit to it. Does anyone have any advice on how I can approach this in a way that will result in a meaningful conversation?  As someone who is actively working on her mental health, this has been very stressful.

TL;DR - boyfriend tried stealing my medication, but won‚Äôt admit it. how can i bring this up without making him feel like he‚Äôs being attacked. i would like to have a genuine conversation about this, but i need to find a way for him to own up to what he did

"Am I just not cut for dating? Be nice please. :( So I'm male. 32. With a learning disability. Looking for a job. Still living with parents because the town I live in is small and we barely have apartments here etc. I'm struggling with looking for someone. I've always been rejected because of my disability. I feel like no woman wants me etc. I've been psychologically emotionally manipulated in High School which gave me severe PTSD because I got bullied and got rejected. 100% true story. Dealing with trauma. Just asked a girl out. Trying to face my fear. She rejected me but she was nice. Think I've handled it well. I also have an over protective mom. Love her to death but she refuses to let me date. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe she thinks me getting rejected again will trigger my PTSD? Any advice guys? My trauma was so bad the girl in question accused me of stalking. Lowered my self esteem so bad I felt like I didn't belong in the school etc. Now I'm having recurring nightmares etc. Let's say she was a narcissist at its finest. Currently going to therapy. EDIT: I always seem to attract TOXIC women. I don't know why??? Even tho I'm a nice guy. It sucks really.

What should I do I need to date someone eventually. I just don't want my mom telling me not to date is all. She keeps saying I have allot of growing up to do on top of that I need a job and need to get my license. Reason I don't have my license is we moved allot. And I have a fear of driving and dying in an accident that I'm trying to get over. I know all the answer for the written test. Just I don't know allot of my friends keep telling me I'm better off being single because I'll have more money and I'll be more happy. But being single is just making me miserable to be honest. I get told I'm a likeable and lovable guy. And I make allot of people laugh and I make girls laugh too. I've been catching girls checking me out lately but I'm too afraid to make a move on them etc I don't like cheesey pick up lines etc. I want to get to know them FIRST and take shit slowly etc. I dont want to rush a relationship if that makes sense.

I hope I'm not the only one in this situation. Can anyone give me advice please or some support? I've been trying to work on my self esteem. Struggling with depression because I'm afraid of the same stuff is gonna happen again if I ask a girl out. Etc. My grandma says men in our family has a history of being rejected by women etc. And have bad luck with women too. Recently I was told my cousin was getting ready to pay for child support. That's just an example btw. Which is true and I don't want to end that route because I don't have a high paying income etc. Sorry.",VRLink64,1,1690652090.0,1.0,2695,527,2695

"Gf [23F] is depressed. Things are improving but its getting so confusing now. Am I [M27] overthinking the situation or its something to worry about? Posting this here again. 

The story is on my profile, however to summarize, my gf has gone through a busy schedule resulting in mental exhaustion and burn out. She told me she cannot handle committment of a marriage though she loves me (thats what she told me in our conversation). I managed to calm her down by assuring her that I will be with her till the end and there is no pressure of marriage, im there regardless. 

For the next 2 weeks our conversations were dry, although I got responses to ""I love you"" and such, things have now gone confusing. She would message first, the conversations are not so dry anymore, they are improving gradually but romance is non existence. Just last time around I would say ""i love you"" and she replied with an ""ilyt"". The next day she would go on message first. Yesterday she didnt reply back with the usual heart emojis, but again messaged first.

"Legitimately curious. Really looking at it I think the biggest problem with me dating is that I don't want anything. All of the perks and benefits of having a relationship sound great but like I don't actually want anything from another person so what am I supposed to ask for? It always came up on facebook. Mostly women, some men. What do I want in a relationship? Nothing. So there's nothing to really talk about for them because I don't look for validation from hardly anyone. Online dating became a huge frustrating loop of, not being rejected, but being matched and wanting absolutely nothing from another human being. I have had mental problems for a seriously long time and I've been in and out if therapy to mixed results. The things people say about talk therapy is true, it isn't very effective for people that don't trust the things you say. My first clinic refused to look into PTSD as a possibility. I know I have it now. After online dating I became incredibly jaded and just wanted to be left alone. Almost full social isolation. And in reality nobody else did anything to me. I took a part time job and I get much more social interaction than I used to. I'm realizing again that I'm more skilled with people than I credit myself.

I just don't know what I'm supposed to ask if, emotionally, there's nothing I need to ask for. I've heard worse stories of judgemental behaviour for others online I just have no control over my anger so I get swept up in the adrenaline and ride the high. People treat sex like it's the be all end all of everything ever but I couldn't care less about not having the attention. I hate having attention. It doesn't feel good, it feels anxious. It feels incredibly anxious. So anxious that I stop filtering my speech and start speaking like a madman. I've tried the meds, it just doesn't go away. 

I don't know hardly anywhere I can go where people would really like me. When I talk about things like Elden Ring here there are already people I 100% know they like it. I don't hardly want to talk about my hobbies with anyone in the world which means I don't want to interact with anyone either.",Reavere312,1,1690800453.0,1.0,2140,391,2140
"How do you actually meet people these days? I have no clue how to meet new women or at the very least I have no idea how to approach them. I live in a small town and people and almost all people here have developed some kind of trust issues. You litteraly can‚Äôt approach somebody without being percieved as a creep. I have tried messaging girls but either I don‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúseen‚Äù, get very short and boring replies that I have no idea how to follow up on, get replies but I can smell that they are either shy or mistrusting from the get go so the conversation is going nowhere, or once in a blue moon get a good conversation going but still get rejected for whatever reason.

For example, I messages a girl, we hit it off great, we went on two dates, albeit 2 days apart from each other, we had a blast both times, but the next day according to her words, she thought that we should stop communicating because past unresolved problems from her last relationship that lasted 7 years according to her words and she hasn‚Äôt quite healed from them, that I was ‚Äútoo mature‚Äù for her(again her words), that things were proceeding too fast. Mind you, I live in a very conservative city, so hookup culture isn‚Äôt as prevalent so we never had sex or anything of that sort, we didn‚Äôt even kiss, but her choice and I didn‚Äôt wanna push needlessly. Anyway, I was still baffled by her decision. I decided not to push because I think it would make me look pathetic if I tried to convince her to give us a try so I just accepted it and moved on.

So, what do I do? Should I just give up and just accept that I can‚Äôt do anything about it and wait for a miracle to happen and just maybe the woman that is for me will appear out od nowhere or does anyone have advice, because I am at a loss here.",AdamDrake21,1,1690930650.0,1.0,1776,345,1776
"UPDATE: I (24F) feel unsure about the relationship I've been in with 31M Hi everyone. My post didn't gain much traction, but I do want to thank those that took the time to comment. I did read everyone's comments, but I didn't respond. Here's the update:

&amp;#x200B;

He decided taking a break was silly, so he decided he wanted to try again, which I agreed to with the boundary that if he emotionally whiplashes me again, I will be leaving. Honestly, though, I didn't feel much of an urge to go spend time with him or be with him. This week I had a psychiatry appointment and a therapy appointment in which I started to talk to my therapist about how I often find myself in unhealthy relationships with men. One of the things that we talked about is knowing my value and setting boundaries and expectations of how I should be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today he and I decided to try to hang out. Part of me was actually really excited. I missed him. He told me he was missing his girl as well. We started to call, and the topics just felt kinda strange. He was immediately asking me about therapy and what my therapist thinks about how we mesh, or what types of things don't mesh well for us. I felt a little uncomfortable because I feel like what I speak about in therapy is really up to me whether I want to disclose, and despite me saying that the therapy appointment wasn't specifically about him or anything he still pushed for answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to screenshare myself playing a game and I got slightly frustrated and made a couple comments that a particular combination of powers in this game was kinda annoying to deal with. He then asked me if I'm frustrated why am I playing it. I said I'm not that frustrated and I'm having fun. He's made comments in the past about the games I play, that I shouldn't play games that frustrate me, etc. And it's like... Idk I would think he would understand because he himself plays games, but there's times where a game might be slightly annoying but you still enjoy it, right? But anyway, he ended up hanging up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to discuss what happened with him, that I don't like when he makes comments about the games I play and when I should and shouldn't play them. He then guilt tripped me, saying ""I guess I'm just a piece of shit then"" and ""well excuse me for caring about you"" and finally blew a fuse, telling me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I finally have had enough of his emotional instability and immaturity. I don't believe I deserve to be spoken to in that way or treated the way he has treated me. Just prior to me sharing my screen, he had told me that nobody he's ever been in a relationship with has ever been as good at ""conflict resolution"" as I have with him. But then he does this. He's just so volatile, and it's either everything is great or everything is awful with him. I have members of my family that have bpd, and I realized the way he acts sorta these two extremes feels kinda similar to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And regarding him pressuring me for sex, I'm really glad I didn't give in. He hasn't really made me feel cared about in quite some time despite it being such a short relationship. I'm not sure what his intentions were with me, but I don't think I'll ever find out. I've now blocked him and I'm ready for a chapter of peace and healing now. I will be working together with my therapist to get to a healthier spot with myself before pursuing another relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess kinda a sad update but probably not one that was unexpected. Thank you to those who took the time to read and respond. I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

"My (25M) crush (25F) seemed very interested and worried if i date or like another woman but when i confessed she said she need to think about it Hello guys, my first post here, hope you guys help me with my situation 


TLDR: she seemed interested and worried if i actually date or like another girl, but when i confessed to her she said ill need to think about it with a smiley face. Any advice on what should I do next?

Here are the details: 

So here is the story, i have that coworker that i really like who i knew several months now, we've been talking here and there but never been very close and never told her my feelings, instead i believed she is taken so always tried to avoid being close so i lose interest. We didn't see each other for a while and i felt like i really need to see her so i texted her over skype when we had the same shift. 

Surprisenly she suggested to add me on Instagram and wanted to see me as well, on my break i was about to go to the next floor to her station just to find out she is already looking for me! So i took as avery clear sing

During convo, she asked me from no where if a girl X (another coworker) is my friend since she saw us before and now she works with her on the same department, i said not a close friend, She answered because you ""guys look close"".., (however ive invited that girl X before but i lost interest very quickly and kept her as friend, i dont if she told her something)

However I didn't focus on that question and i was just decided to tell her about my feelings next day.

So today i texted her agin to meet and i told her directly that i like her, she had a positive body language and reaction but she immediately said ""but i thought you actually like the girl X"", i said ""what? No i dont, even if i maybe did before i quickly lose interest when i smell a toxic trait"" and promised to tell her the full story later,, she was smiling and playfully asked so i actually met all your boundaries? .. however we kept laughing at it for a while and i asked about her answer, she said ""i need to think about it"". 

That got me really confused, is she actually need to think about it since maybe she thought i have no interest in her and i actually like the other girl and now she need to reconcider things? she showed many positive sings and when she said it she was smiling and laughing instead of being uncomfortable with a ""sorry"" body language. On the other hand if she is actually interested and want the same she would just say yes, people use ""ill think about it"" to politely say no and maybe that smile is just how she is.

I really like this girl, i usually lose interest very fast but this girl really got me, and no matter how much time i tried to avoid her yet she never left my mind, am now really confused and i don't know if its worth it to wait or should i bring the subject up again to her and ask her to make it clear for me?? Or should i just leave her alone and move on

"How would you react if an attractive girl reached out to you like this? So recently, someone I (F23) went to high school with crossed my mind. We had mutual friends but we never spoke I don‚Äôt think. I always had the biggest crush on him (M23/24). I ended up switching to an arts school for sophomore-senior year. 3 years ago I deleted all of my social media and I‚Äôm pretty sure we had followed each other on Instagram (we never messaged or anything). I don‚Äôt really know if he‚Äôd even like remember me now? I know he still lives in my city and I really would like to reach out to him. If I still had social media this would obviously be a lot easier but now I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll ever contact him. I can‚Äôt deny that I have done some creeping on his social media accounts from my friend‚Äôs so it‚Äôs confirmed that he is single and still lives and works in my city. He seems super cool and I think we‚Äôd have a lot in common. How in the world do I run into him/contact him?

Would it be absolutely insane to make an Instagram account just to DM him so he can put a face to a name and say something like, ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt know if you remember me but we went to high school together and I randomly thought of you so I thought I‚Äôd reach out‚Ä¶.‚Äù.

"How do you feel about ""Open Phone Policies"" when dating? Are you for it?

Against?

Don't care either way?

Why?

Personally, I never have anything to hide so I'd feel indifferent.

I've been in relationships with open phone policies in the past (without actually calling it that) since it was just more convenient to use whoever's phone was closest at the time if we needed to look something up.

However, if we were married, it would have to be required.  My reason is that if we have both names on the shared title of homes, names on the shared titles of cars, names on the shared credit cards, names on shared investment accounts, and sharing joint bank accounts, then sharing phones is SERIOUSLY the LOWEST on the totem pole of those things already being shared.",johnwayne2413,1,1690848050.0,1.0,767,135,767
"Gay guy scans my body For context, im a female close friend. He did admit he had relationships that were female in the past but he leans on the other side now. 

The concern I have is he frequently scans my body whenever we meet looking at boobs section. I notice it multiple times. Although he does mention im like his younger sister but when he does this, it feels weird.

Anyone can figure out what scanning of the body means if he is gay and not into that? One time he also mentioned to me he likes big boobs and he was referring to the person we saw who had one. 

He is openly admiring guys and had sexual activities with them so I'm not sure how to take this.",Dazzling_Ant_6881,1,1690267134.0,1.0,666,131,666
"Help! When to break up TL;DR I've been seeing a guy for a few months (only about once or twice a week, though, so it still feels pretty new). However, I'm now pretty convinced it won't work out long term and I need to end things sooner rather than later, but the timing is horrid and I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and deal with the messy fall out or let things drag out for a month and then end it when there won't be as many complications.  
A few months ago, I met a guy at a mutual friends birthday party (she was hoping we'd hit it off, so it was a bit of a set-up). And, it was fun and exciting at first, but then we kissed and I instantly lost all feelings of attraction when he initiated a French kiss. For context, I've never kissed anyone before nor been in a serious relationship (which he knows). So, I don't know if I just don't like French kissing or if it's related to him.  
A few days after the kiss, I managed to stop thinking back on it with negative thoughts and get my feelings to mostly neutral, but I can't get the attraction back. We kept meeting up, although only about once per week (we were both doing a lot of traveling and I wasn't really pushing to meet up more, although I think he would have liked to). I really enjoy spending time with him and we go out and have fun together, but my sexual attraction towards him seems to be stuck at neutral.  
He's been really nice and is very clear that we should go at my pace, and I was planning on going all the way with him at some point (I need to get some medical stuff done, so I can't right now anyways). But, I'm realizing now that might be worse to have sex when I'm not really feeling it and then break up shortly afterwards? I felt like I owed him something for being so patient (no pressure from him), but now I realize it's maybe more likely he'd feel used?  
The other night, we had a heavy make-out session (all but PIV). And, it was nice but honestly not more than that. And, he seems to be getting more interested and wanting to spend all our time together while I'm just as happy on my own. The last few times we've met up, I've tried to be more careful about not giving him a compliment back just because he gave me one and only saying things if I really mean them, which has definitely led to me receiving more compliments than I'm giving, but I don't know if he'll pick up on that as a clue that I'm not feeling things and drifting away or still be completely blindsided.  
The major problem I have now is when to do it. We'll have to see each other at least a couple times in the next few weeks as we're working on a project together. The only way to avoid that would be if I almost completely cut contact with a lot of my friends for a month since he's more integral to the project than I am (they know we're dating, though, so I think they would understand me wanting to give him space, but I still think it would make our friendship suffer). Additionally, my birthday is coming up in a few weeks and we just started talking about plans for it. I would have really loved to invite everyone over (his friends and mine) and have a party. But, I don't want to drag this out and feel like either now before we actually plan anything for my birthday is the best time or after the project and my birthday have passed. I fear no matter what I do, he's going to feel blindsided and heartbroken. And, I genuinely would really want to stay friends (especially since our friends groups overlap), but he seems to have really strong feelings towards me, so I'm worried that won't work out.  
Is there a way I could gradually end things over a month that would be less painful?  
And, should I go with my plan of saying I really like him as a person and friend, but my sexual attraction towards him just isn't there and he deserves someone to love all of him? Or will that just open the door to bargaining?  
Thank you,

"What‚Äôs the norm for getting with other people when you‚Äôre dating, but not yet had the exclusivity talk? 
So just for context, there is a tldr at the bottom, I (m22) was in a relationship that was pretty not great. I really cared about her (f22) but I just felt unwanted. I didn‚Äôt really communicate my issues and I suppose I approached things with a ‚Äútoxic positivity‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs called. I‚Äôm working on that ofcourse, but then throughout the relationship she‚Äôd used to drop my hand, run away and pretend to not know me when we saw someone she vaguely knew or someone made a comment about me cause my drinks took too long. She also went from all lovey Dovey to acting sick of me all the time overnight and I still don‚Äôt know why. Nothing to be done about that, but I wanna start dating again so obviously I need to look at what boundaries I need to set.

So that leads me to this, one of the things I didn‚Äôt find out till near the end was something that happened quite early. A couple days before we became ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù she had been on a night out with her friend for the first time in a while. As she described it at the time her friend kept pulling guys to speak to her and she couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about me the whole time she was talking to them. This was the first time they went out for a long time. Anyway her friend (F23) later spoke about a night they went out after my ex had broken up with her ex, that my ex was necking off with and getting with every guy she introduced her to, and my ex confirmed that was true but I didn‚Äôt say or think anything of it cause I trusted her. At the end of the relationship I found out she literally rebounded with me straight after breaking up with her ex (M?) though, I‚Äôd actually originally been led to believe there was a few months between me and her ex but it was actually only a couple of weeks. So given the timeline her friend must‚Äôve been on about the same night out cause my ex said when I asked that was the only time she‚Äôd been on a night out since she broke up with her ex before me.

So I guess I wanna know what to expect out of dating for the future. I didn‚Äôt really care when I found out tbh cause it was already over, but I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve been bothered if I found out at the time. Is that something that‚Äôs ok for people to do after dating for a couple months? Me personally I wouldn‚Äôt make out with someone in a club while I‚Äôm dating someone even if we‚Äôre not exclusive, or even if I have a first date planned cause it doesn‚Äôt feel morally right. To me dating others is fine before going exclusive but I feel like dating and getting with strangers in clubs shouldn‚Äôt coexist. We weren‚Äôt exclusive at this point, until a couple days later, but she was thinking about me the whole time apparently. Should I be cautious of things like this for future, or is it just a part of dating? Should I be setting boundaries for this sort of thing earlier on?

Tldr - my ex was getting with guys in clubs while we had been dating for a couple months but before we were exclusive. Should I be more cautious of things like this in the future or is it just the norm for dating?",NoHead1128,1,1690648254.0,1.0,3129,610,3129

\- Slept with someone else the same day we broke up (multiple times)  
\- Made out with a 14 year old (he is 20)  
\- He supports school sh\*\*ters and terr\*rism  
\- Mysoginist and red p\*ll  
\- Objectifies people for sex  
\- Anger issues  
\- Wanted to k\*ll his ex girlfriend  
\- Cheated on me once a week (not always physical)  
\- Tired to break up with me once a week (we always talk it out)  
\- Everytime he tries to break up with me, he talks to other 10 people  
\- Slept with pr\*stit\*tes   
\- Emotionally and verbally abused me  
\- Stingy as hell  
\- Will leave you at the side of the road at night if you make him angry  
\- knew I was a virgin and was willing to wait but when e realized he had to get tested before we get intimate he changed his mind (he still did it in the end with a lot of convincing)  
\- Said he was willing to wait for me to be ready but kept pressuring me through break ups  
\- I always planned the dates  
\- Etc  
So basically I break up with him and block him permanently, a week later he manages to contact me begging me for another chance, telling me he was depressed and was willing to put in the work, this had never happened so I believed him, fast forward to two days later, he says he changed his mind because someone else who is ‚Äúsl\*ttier‚Äù than me, wanted to be friends with benefits with him‚Ä¶.   
I‚Äôm the only second person in his life he was/wanted to be in a relationship with and he knows he‚Äôll never find someone like me (that I have special) , but he chose to have sex with someone else instead of waiting for me, I gave him so much unconditional love but he chose to be selfish.  
I try to talk it out because I know he is disordered and impulsive, he manages to have a moment of clarity and agrees to get back with me but then he loses it and starts cussing me out telling me to leave him alone and he isn‚Äôt sure what he wants, I block him.  
How should I see all this? I am not jealous of the new guy because my ex told me himself I am better, he just chose him because of sex, but it still bothers me, how could he choose something so frivolous over genuine connection? And if I had given him my virginity, would he still be with me?",pixelthoughtz,1,1690634150.0,1.0,2418,475,2418
"Ghosted after revealing height I‚Äôm getting pretty sick of OLD and the blatant rudeness and disrespect regarding my height. 

I‚Äôm in my early 30s. I‚Äôve been told I am very attractive throughout my life. I stay in great shape, and am very, very well-off financially. I am well-liked, keep an active social life and am kind and easy to talk to, being quite outgoing. Im a very confident person, but even I‚Äôve had a stretches where the height thing gets to me. Im 5‚Äô3. I‚Äôm *always* honest about this and use professionally-shot, well-representative photographs. 

Just matched with a great girl - she seemed very into me, but after days of talking hit me with the ‚Äúsorry if it seems superficial, but how tall are you?‚Äù I realized that we met on an app where I had forgotten to list my height. I responded and was ghosted. I‚Äôve almost been conditioned to stop responding after this question. 90% of the time, it leads to me being ghosted, or flat out insulted. Very hurtful given how respectful I am even if someone doesn‚Äôt meet my preferences. I get no response being a response, but I‚Äôm allowed to get discouraged when this happens multiple times a day, and an insult is never an okay response. Women meet me in person and have flat out said ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre shorter than I thought, I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù, or other rude comments. 

Even my last LTR saw my GF admit after months that my height was a huge issue and she almost ditched me at first after several long talks with close friends about how much my height bothered her. Despite that I was ‚Äúunbelievably kind, smart, successful, handsome, well-endowed, treated her well‚Äù. Her exes were all 6‚Äô+ (and chubby, and not great looking). Relationship was constantly full of her hating our photos cause she ‚Äúlooked big‚Äù (i outweighed her by 30 lbs), her telling me to stand up straight, her insulting my photos with friends because they‚Äôre taller, etc. She was *shorter* than I was btw. 

I have since learned to *always* list it up front but some rudeness still seeps through. I can‚Äôt help but feel it is a nearly debilitating blow to my chances, at least compared to if I were even 6‚Äù taller. I still get a fair number of matches, and dates, but feel as if this is nearly insurmountable some days. Repeated bad experiences in succession take a toll on my confidence.

"Beauty is not subjective I believe that beauty is not entirely subjective because certain aspects of aesthetics are universally appreciated across cultures and generations. While personal preferences may vary, there are fundamental elements of beauty that evoke a positive response in most people. For instance, symmetry, balance, and harmony are often regarded as aesthetically pleasing traits in art, nature, and even human faces. Additionally, certain natural landscapes, such as serene beaches or majestic mountains, consistently evoke a sense of wonder and admiration in people from different backgrounds.

"Different approaches by men and women on dating sites? (Not generalizing) New to this group so trying to keep the rules in mind.

As a prefix here, I want to be clear I am NOT generalizing, just relating my honest observations. 

I have used eharmony on and off since July 2021. I went to this site as it struck me in being one of the more reputable and 'serious' sites. I am a straight 37 year old man. 

My experience has been very mixed. I had some painful encounters but also met sincere matches, some of whom I mutually agreed to remain friends as we respected one another. This post will not be about all those experiences or all the ins and outs of online dating.

I want to be a bit more specific in one 'trend' I have noticed. 

I think it is fair to say that with online dating, much like physical dating, the man is expected to make the first move. I can honestly say about 95% of the conversations I have had with matches had been initiated by me and speaking to other men, they concur they initiated contact.

Inevitably, this means that male members need to have a certain level of persistence and effort, otherwise they are likely to have no communication at all. I am not talking about persistence with individuals (actually eharmony has a 5 post limit - ie send her a message, smiley face, like her intro etc) but rather the approach that is required to get any attention at all.

To give an idea of this persistence, I might message say, 8 matches I am interested in over a few weeks. Of those 8, I MIGHT get one response. I think only by communicating can you know if you are compatible with someone. 

Even when I do get a response, there is no guarantee of a follow up and I find some members find it easier to lie than be upfront and say they are not interested. 

Now before people get the wrong idea here, I am always polite, never sleazy and sincere in my desire to find the right match. I am average looking but I feel I 'sell' myself on my profile and I am open enough to show there are no obvious red flags. 

I know the problem isn't with my approach because of those matches I have spoke to the communication has largely been respectful and positive. In some cases she ultimately rejected me or I rejected her because we decided we were not compatible enough or there were external factors (different life plans, feelings for an ex etc) My point is I am not writing as some sort of insecure guy who lacks confidence or skill with women. 

I have had good relationships before and plenty of female friends. 

So why is the ratio of messages received/responses given the way it is? 

I used to think some members were basically rude - and to some extent I still believe that is the case. To me, if someone spent time composing a thoughtful message I would show them the basic respect of replying even if I wasn't really attracted to them. I literally came across one match who was asking guys to show they were sincere by writing a long message - then she couldn't be bothered to respond. 

When I have asked women about this, the responses are usually as follows: 

\- they had got hurt and felt foolish by making the first move and then getting rejected. 

\- Due to experience of sexual harassment they mistrusted the intentions of guys on dating sites. 

So let's consider these two points -

\- No one likes to be rejected but men get hurt too yet still have no choice but to continue making the first move

\- To be fair, this probably is something female members experience much more and I can understand if a woman is getting constant sleazy messages, she would become cynical and feel that is all male members are interested in. But this also in my view depends on the specific site. Some simply have a better quality of members than others. And of course there are plenty of men who are sincere in their search and not just looking for sex. 

I have also considered practical factors. Ultimately dating sites are businesses and in order to make a profit they rely on paid memberships. It may well be that a lot of members sign up to these sites then realize they cannot respond to messages. Or in some cases it really is an issue of time commitment - some people go in half-heartedly and/or simply get to busy to follow up. I think this is understandable - however I still think there should be a basic sense of consideration for others and that is something that people don't take accountability for. I am not talking about rejection. Any female or male member has a right to reject someone if they are not interested but there is no excuse to mislead someone or waste their time. 

Anyway, i'll round this up.

Some people may falsely interpret this as a rant about women on dating sites. It really isn't. I am well aware that people are individuals and for every entitled person who doesn't consider others there is another considerate person who does.

I think men and women both face pressures but in different ways. Broadly speaking (again I am not generalizing or saying one size fits all) Men do have to make more effort in that initial contact and experience message after message being ignored or not followed up. 

But women may well experience issues that we men cannot see. Maybe the aforementioned sleaziness is higher than one might think. After all, I can't see directly how other guys are communicating. Maybe pressure to 'not hurt his feelings' by telling him the truth. Personally I would rather have a polite rejection than ignored and I have experienced both. For me a polite rejection just means it is not meant to be with that person whereas being ignored really saps energy and makes you wonder - what is the point of trying? 

I have posted this in the spirit of being candid about my own experience and for something to think about. It is in no way intended to incite a 'battle of the sexes' but rather, hopefully help people to be more considerate in their approach to online dating. Maybe you are a woman and thinking 'but guys do that to!' and I would not argue. Online dating is damn difficult and takes enormous patience but I think people who are sincere and serious can all help to create a better experience.

Do members agree with my take? Maybe you have experienced something different? Maybe women here can follow up on some of the points i've raised for instance. But I do feel that whilst online dating can be trying for anyone, there are basic approaches that differ. In no way do I claim to speak for all men and I am absolutely aware people are individuals, I just think that men and women do think in different ways about some of this. 

Finally, I would appreciate no snarky responses ie 'this guy is just bitter etc' - my intention here is for mature discussion in the spirit I have written this. 

Actually at the time of writing, I am getting particularly close to one lady and whilst practical circumstances may keep us apart (she has a pre-planned work contract abroad and we are still awaiting the outcome of her exam) - so I am writing more in retrospect and to be informative and thought-provoking.

"How do I (m28) get intimate with my date (f24) and do you think she wants more than friendship? Hi,  I (m28) have always had problems getting intimate with a woman and  kissing her. I am 28 and have only had one relationship. My ex made it  even harder for me because she had some childhood trauma (and also cried  after sex because of it).

I get on dates reasonably well, can generate sympathy and am not extremely shy. But I can't make the next step.

Now,  finally, there is another woman (f24) I like. That never really  happened since my ex. I find her attractive, we share some interests and  she is chilled out. I met her through Bumble. We have met 4 times so  far and nothing has happened yet.

The  first time we met we went to several bars. The second date we had ice  cream. Now things are getting a little weird. Afterwards we talked about  kinks and ""money slaves"". She found it interesting and funny. I then  got her a ""cash and go"" meeting through another app. A guy met with her  and paid her 50 euros. We both found the experience exciting and she  tells me a lot about it.

Then we  had a 4th meeting at my house. We ate pizza and sat next to each other  on my couch for 3 hours. I often touched her thigh, tried to build up  closeness, but did not have the impression as if she wanted to kiss  me.After the meeting she also contacted me again. I slowly think I'm  slipping into the friend zone, but really want more.

The  chats are very basic. So real enthusiasm does not want to arise from  both sides. But I am also not the chat type. She has really given no  indication at all that she wants to be kissed and I am finding it hard  to take the initiative. She has mentioned once that she is also looking  for friends through Bumble. She also wants to go out partying with me  sometime.

Do you think she sees the whole thing only friendly?

"Please give me advice on how to flirt! thanks! I (18M) am an incoming college student from the Philippines and I‚Äôve made a couple of friends online who are also going to study in the same university. I communicate to most of them through Instagram and I found one (18F) of them to be really fun to talk to, she was also quite cute and attractive so I had already developed a mild crush on her. She‚Äôs very friendly and we have a lot in common so talking to her isn‚Äôt difficult at all, sometimes we talk for hours on end until one of us has to do something else. We‚Äôre going to meet for the first time this Thursday during a school event and then we‚Äôre gonna check out the campus museum together. What I‚Äôm worried about is what if I say something that‚Äôll either make her think I‚Äôm being too ‚Äúforward‚Äù with her or too ‚Äúfriendzoneable‚Äù? ‚Äîalso she lowkey mentioned she was gay in a jokingly manner but idk if shes serious abt that‚Äî

"Is there a chance? My ex boyfriend (33) and I (26) have broken up a few times and every time it‚Äôs been a pretty big deal (big scene is made) but we‚Äôve got back together all times even though one Involved me moving out of our apartment (I moved back in months later) this last time in particular was a bigger deal my family was involved, we both moved from our apartment and my dad told him not to talk to me anymore even as friends, we didn‚Äôt talk for a month straight and I honestly thought it was done but we are back to phone calls again and talking about making plans to hangout etc. We live in different cities and I don‚Äôt see us moving back together since we both got new jobs that we really enjoy, and have kinda set up our own places during this time‚Ä¶ so anyways do you think there‚Äôs a chance the relationship can flourish with this space ( we moved in within a few months of knowing each other  ) or do you think living together then living apart will never work out‚Ä¶ 

Extra info: during our month of no contact I really thought things were done because he didn‚Äôt answer my few messages, then one day he texted me early saying he hoped I was well with a song that made him think of me. I was shocked; kinda went with the flow and now we‚Äôre talking on the phone. I thought maybe Is he bored and just wants someone ? Him not answering for a month hurt my feelings so I was skeptical. Now talking more I think he did care like I did but because of this secret conversation my dad went and had with him he felt embarrassed or obligated to stay away from me but gave in eventually. The relationship is a sore subject on both ends right now, like neither one of us brings it up In any context but old nicknames and plans and things are slipping in if that makes sense I think we‚Äôre both just not wanting to be negative  or put pressure in any way so we‚Äôre just enjoying it as it is going with the flow. just wondering if anyone‚Äôs had similar situations, and how that‚Äôs played out.",hellokitty_k67,1,1690706088.0,1.0,1984,387,1984
"Is it weird my M21 friend invited me over his house to watch netflix after eating out? I'm a M21 and my childhood also M21 messaged me asking if i wanted to hang out last week. I agreed that I would meet up with him after not speaking to each other for some time. So I drove to his house which was about a 20 minute drive from where i live. Once i got there to his place he insisted that he will drive me a restaurant and we ate and spoke about work related stuff, hobbies, and life in general for about 30 minutes. After he offered to take me to the movies and I declined as I was getting tired. So he drove me back to his house and invited over to stay at his place for while to chill and watch netflix which i agreed to. We chilled for maybe 5 minutes scolling on netflix deciding what movie we should watch. After 5 minutes of awkward silence his parents came back home unexpectedly I just decided to wrap things up quickly and told him I should be going as I had work the following day. Weirdly enough he insisted that he will walk me to my car which was parked about 3 minutes away from his house. It was about 8:00pm by then and ended with him giving me a bro hug once I got to my car. the whole thing just felt ironic as we're both guys, expecially the netflix thing.

"My boyfriend is depressed and I don't know how to help/what to do I (23) started seeing my boyfriend (26) 4 months ago. Things were going great  but I noticed he occasionally has a few days of depressive episodes. I've struggled with mental health in the past and it seems like he would get out of the funk after a while. He came from the UK not long ago and is just settling in, but is currently struggling financially after the big move.
Recently, he's been getting really bad, to the point where I was concerned he was going to harm himself. I know he's had mental health issues in the past and has gone to therapy, which seemed to help, but this move has been super hard on him. 
I want to be there for him because I do love him but I don't know what to do anymore. He's agreed to go to therapy if we can find something free, but I'm concerned this will be a recurring thing and I don't know if I could do this my whole life. I know I'm young, and that I have time to figure out my life/relationships but I truly do care for him and want him to be better. I'm also quite concerned that if I do leave (which I hope I don't have to do) he will just spiral even more. 

He's been trying to hide it from me so he doesn't burden me but I do try to talk to him about it and he does open up. Any advice on what I should do?",ThrowRA189090,1,1690837035.0,1.0,1320,268,1320
"I messed up, I saved my crush's other number secretly and now he's found out, I don't know what to do. Okay so, please don't judge but I've messed up a little bit and I know I sound like a red flag.  
I've been talking to this guy for the last 2 months, we hit it off, we exchanged numbers and we started talking and calling on whatsapp. That's cool. It's normal. So now I started developing a crush on this guy and you know when that happens you start searching them up. So I did just that. His socials are public so I could see every post, every like. Everything. I did a happy dance because now I could get to know him a bit better. We don't have each other on socials, we just have each others numbers so this was exciting.  
Anyway, so now as I'm scrolling through facebook, I see that he's made a post on a group we both had in common a few months ago and he posted his phone number there, a different one. So I did the thing that only intellectuals would do. I saved that number in my phone. I don't know what I was thinking. I just did it thinking if he ever pulled a prank on me from his other number now I'd know. That number was also active on whatsapp.  
Fast forward to today, I posted a status on my stories on whatsapp not knowing what the future held for me..A few hours later, a text comes through, I check my phone absolutely puzzled, turns out its from his number that I saved secretly. It said 'Why is your status showing up on this number of mine?' I saw his message and now I'm numb.   
I'm so scared. I know I did the wrong thing. Even though his post on facebook was public and anyone could contact him from there I still feel like it was an invasion of someones privacy as it was a bit of a personal post that he had made and I broke those rules. Now I'm too scared to admit what I actually did.  
Is there something else I can come up with that would seem legible? I don't want him to know I was stalking him as we hadn't talked since 5 days. He hadn't replied back to my text which is fine but now he's going to think it was all connected! I'm so worried. I don't know what to do. I just checked facebook and he deleted the post where I got his number from so I think he has an idea now. I'm so scared. Also if he saw my status that means he had my number saved on his other phone too. I don't know what to do!",throwaway-m-2598,1,1690837330.0,1.0,2337,470,2337

"Help!!!! What do I do. I‚Äôm a 47 divorced female.  I have been texting and FaceTiming with a man I met on tinder since 2018. at the time we both understood that we were not interested in a relationship. I gave him my number and would text interactive romantic, passionate fantasies every once in a while, they got progressively more intimate through out the years.  last year I met someone different and started going on dates. I recieved an IM from my friend from tinder and told him I had met someone and thought that I could probably get into a relationship with this new person.  that is when he opened up and said that he wanted to be my FB. even though, through out all these years we had messaged about meeting our schedules never opened up.  throughout the years our desires got deeper for each other we did finally meet and had a very passionate romantic day my desires were met but had room for more.  after that we went back to the same sporadic romantic passionate communication we had prior. then he stopped for months,  I was hardly the woman that would make the first text out of respect for his young  children,  in case they had his phone.  one  night I worked the nerve and messaged him.  he replied and informed me he had moved out of state. we chatted that night and have been sporadically chatting and FaceTiming every once in a while again. I find this man very attractive, our way of interacting with these fantasies and our one passionate get together made me feel that maybe we could be more than this whatever we have. the last time we interacted,  he mentioned he was dating and thought he was ready for a relationship.  I told him I was dating but was very disappointed in the men that I was going out with.  he gave me advice for my next date,  I followed his advice, it did not work to say the least.  when I reached out to tell him his advice did not go so welll.  he replied with an emoji that implied that he was happy the date did not workout  I am confused on what this man wants.  he implies he wants me to go out with others and yet seems to get more active when I‚Äôm moving on towards my goal of a relationship.  he says he is ready for a relationship and dating but yet gives me mixed messages.  I‚Äôm thinking strongly of moving on from him and finding what I want. But yet I think of his feelings and the thought of not telling him how I feel and ignoring him completely is wrong, after all these years.

"Will my living situation repel women if I put myself out there? I am a 27M and I would like some preferably female input regarding my lifestyle and living situation in regards to how (un)attractive it makes me in the dating market. 

I have little dating experience outside of a couple hook ups and 1 month ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù in high school. Since then many things have happened that led to to mostly giving up on ever finding a partner to start a family with. For as long as I can remember I have wished to experience the joys of fatherhood but I also told myself long ago that if I ever had children, I would need to still be young and healthy enough with enough energy to be an active participant in my child‚Äôs life. Meaning that I gave myself a time limit. If by 30 years of age I wasn‚Äôt a Father or soon to be one, I would give up on that dream. 

Which brings us to why I‚Äôm here today. I‚Äôm becoming increasingly aware of how my impending 3rd decade of life is quickly approaching, and that I must act just as quickly if I am ever to achieve the future I want. However, I also don‚Äôt want to waste my time, money and effort if it turns out that there‚Äôs no way a woman would date a man in my situation. 

I am 6ft and weigh 240lbs, average to below average looks, I work 5 days, 50 hours a week making deliveries in my car for a legitimate cannabis company. I own my own car, a 2022 Honda Civic and I make almost 60K a year. However I am currently co-renting a 2-story 5 Bed 3 Bath house with my parents as well as my (25) younger brother and his wife with 2 dogs as well. Moving out is not an option as I am an active contributor in the household beyond simply paying rent. I spend my free time buying and reading manga (I have 3 bookshelves and counting full of volumes I‚Äôve purchased) watching anime and playing video games. My greatest talent is my singing voice, I am professionally trained having gone to an arts high school, had several lead roles in theatre productions. I hate to sound like I‚Äôm bragging but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most proud of so I thought I should at least mention it. I only have 2 close friends and only 1 of them I see regularly where we hang out at his place where we smoke weed, watch anime and play video games (I know, my life isn‚Äôt very exciting) My work hours are from 1pm-11pm and I usually have 2 weekdays off so I don‚Äôt ever really have the opportunity to go out and enjoy the nightlife like most people do. I also don‚Äôt like to drink that much so I usually have a drink once every few months on special occasions. This is all I can think of about myself off the top of my head, I can answer questions about myself if this isn‚Äôt enough to go off of. 

So yeah, that‚Äôs the short of it. I‚Äôm under no delusion that my situation is in any way ideal for a woman looking to date a man. I am aware of how boring and uninteresting I come off to most people. I would just like some general opinions, do I have a modicum of a chance, or should I accept the fact that it‚Äôll be nearly impossible to find a woman looking to start a family that is also willing to settle for someone like me and give up on having children? 

TL;DR 
Is someone who rents a house with their parents and sibling and his wife, spends their free time collecting manga and playing video games too undesirable to date regardless of having a full time job and a slightly above average income?",InsecureDriver,1,1690700719.0,0.67,3384,656,3384

"She said that it was just a summer thing but the thing we‚Äôre doing right now seems like boyfriend a girlfriend thing. Should I be straight forward and ask her what does she wants in this ‚Äúthing‚Äù that we have? Because we‚Äôre not having sex (even though at first she said she wanted a hookup) and it‚Äôs just getting way too romantic for it to be a summerfling.

I (M18) met this girl (F18) during a friend hangout. We hit off and generally have a good time. At first I didn‚Äôt want to take thing serious and just want a summer fling. I then found out from a mutual friend that she also want the same thing. I then asked her if she wanted to hangout. We then kissed by the end of the hangout. Fast forward me and the same group hangout again this time with her. This time we both gotten really drunk. We then proceed to have a full on make out session. The furthest I have went was grabbing her chest, nothing more than that but we did made out for 2 hours straight. During the made out she told me that she loved me but I didn‚Äôt take it too serious as we were both drunk and she take those words back right away. 

We then hang out afterwards again but this time the kissed just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. It was a lot more passionate, the type of kissed you would get from a relationship. 

We would then start face-timing each-other frequently and even sleep calls. During one of the call she asked if i‚Äôm looking for something serious i then told her it‚Äôs too early to say. I asked her the same question and she said the same thing I said.

Now after multiple facetiming, we would facetime for hours, I then realize i‚Äôm falling for this girl. I would then ask her the same question she asked me earlier which was ‚Äúare you looking for something serious‚Äù. She would then respond ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs summer‚Äù. Implying that she don‚Äôt want it to be serious. I think that she knows that i‚Äôm starting to have feelings for her because I was a lot more invested into it. 
After all of this she still let me kissed her. 

So how do I tell her that I want more than kissing and making out (having sex) or tell her that I like her and make it serious. Neither is fine with me, I just don‚Äôt know how to approach this situation.

So i‚Äôm fairly young here i‚Äôm talking to this girl and she‚Äôs admitted to me she likes me and i like her back we‚Äôve been talking for about a month we met first on our college taster day and i walked her home and i tried to kiss her as i always kiss the first time i meet so it‚Äôs obvious to them i still like them romantically after meeting in person however she moved away, she said she was really sorry and sent a lot of messages saying she was just nervous because she really likes me so i just brushed it off as she has only kissed one other boy compared to my seven girls so i wasn‚Äôt too worried although it did feel bad. so we went out again today and it was like a proper date we went to a nice restaurant and the movies however not once did we touch at all or kiss so i‚Äôm abit worried now as i‚Äôd think by the second time we‚Äôd at least touch each other especially at the movies, the worst thing is whenever i touch her in a non romantic way like i had to guide her body in a crowd so i used my hand and she kind of froze and i‚Äôm worried if she‚Äôs just disgusted by me touching her or something

when we spoke about the first kiss rejection she said next time would be different and after the nerves of the first meeting went she‚Äôd start the kiss since she rejected me first time but in the movies she seemed really closed off like she didn‚Äôt want to be touched, i kept looking to see if i could put my arm around her but the way she was sat made it impossible and like she didn‚Äôt want to anyway. i‚Äôve never had this before and it‚Äôs starting to effect the way i am with her, i understand sometimes people wait to kiss but the no touch really amplifies this for me

He said he couldn‚Äôt forgive me, no matter how much I begged and pleaded. During our relationship he has wanted to leave me a number of times because of my past/lies. He told me a week later whilst we are on holiday that he had lied about how many people he had slept with (something which I hadn‚Äôt lied about I told him the truth about mine) and the amount really hurt me. He said he lied out of shame and guilt and then wanted to get back with me. I felt really hurt and as though he has enjoyed making me suffer for the past few months regarding my past. I feel he had been so unfair to me because he had treated me the way he has when all along he lied too and much worse. I was shocked, he felt no guilt at all no matter how many times I asked. In his defence he also asked me many times and I chose to reveal my past slowly bit by bit because I couldn‚Äôt take the judgment and shame it brought me. He forgave me everytime but I feel it was out of guilt because he was hiding so much more. I understand what I did was wrong, I thought I could conceal my past sins and only tell him enough to have a broad idea. I am hurt at how he used my past against me and I wouldn‚Äôt have done the same to him if I knew his past. I am hurt that he made me feel as though I am the only liar. I understand his reasons completely. Moving on, he begged for another chance (during the rest of our holiday) and I forgave him about a week later on the second day of returning. During that week I struggled to forgive him. He realised that how he treated me for the past 4 months for my lies despite lying himself, was narcissistic. The things that occurred and the way I was made to feel. It was narcissism and we both agreed on that. I felt he would always treat me with such unfairness. I understand why he lied, he felt ashamed and I love this man and so I dropped it. I‚Äôve been really ill whilst the majority of this happened, I‚Äôve had tonsillitis and otitis externa (ear infection) and on the day I got it (second last day of our holiday) he left me alone most the day. This was when I hadn‚Äôt given him the chance in his defence, we were broken up. He got me food when I asked and made me a cold flannel for my head, but left me alone 90% of the day and went out and had fun doing water activities. That same night he headed out at 11pm and I wanted to wait up for him. We were in a different country and I was worried for his safety. This same night he turned off his location and deleted all our pictures (he said it was because he felt hurt which I understand). I messaged him and he said he was safe and at a barber shop because he needed space (this was at 2am) because seeing me made him hurt as we were no longer together which again I understand. I couldn‚Äôt handle it, I went out to look for him as there were many barber shops nearby but couldn‚Äôt find him (he was at one deeper in town). I was in tears the whole time. I was begging him to reply to me and after an hour of texts he came home. I lost it and asked how he could put me through everything. I‚Äôve felt worried, untrusting of him, ill, and betrayed. I began cursing at him when he said he‚Äôs done nothing wrong (something which we didn‚Äôt do in our relationship). We had a big argument, horrible things were said from us both including me and the next day we headed home. He pleaded for a chance this day and I rejected it, I wanted him and love him but the pain felt too much. A day later I‚Äôve given him this chance and I‚Äôm still ill and he comes to see me to take care of me. As soon as I gave him the chance things were starting to go wrong. I felt a lot of the rules we had during the relationship were made out of control, something he acknowledged and agreed on. I scrapped our rule of getting home by a certain time (10:30pm) and said not to take the mick with it, I‚Äôm just removing it to make it a variable time to get home because things can be unexpected. We have never gone out late with our friends or came back at crazy times. I was happy with coming home by 10:30, but I felt the rule was out of control on his part and I wanted to shake that feeling. The next day he goes out with his friends and comes home at 2:30am. I wasn‚Äôt okay with this and explained to him how I said we weren‚Äôt going to take advantage with it and just once in a blue moon will come home after midnight. I also said I didn‚Äôt expect you to hop on it straight away as we have making up to do. The next day he messages me telling me he‚Äôs going out (it‚Äôs 10:30pm) and didn‚Äôt give me a time as to when he‚Äôd be back. I expressed I wasn‚Äôt okay with this and was starting to worry because I thought he was up to something. He was going with friends I‚Äôve never heard of and they were going to a park to just chill. I wasn‚Äôt okay with it and he went anyways. I broke up with him and blocked him on everything, I felt like my emotional needs would never be taken into consideration and that he didn‚Äôt care about me anymore. The next day I found myself missing him like crazy, I‚Äôve fallen in love with this man and can‚Äôt understand how things went so wrong. We‚Äôre so compatible and have felt like best friends since we‚Äôve met. The whole of yesterday and last night I was messaging him begging for us to work through this. I went to see my friends but left early as I needed to be alone. He expressed how he felt I had given up on him and he doesn‚Äôt want this anymore. I have been completely lost, I‚Äôve felt uncared for and disrespected and completely lost but understand he feels given up on. He blocked me on absolutely everything but left me on Twitter and so I messaged him carrying on. He rang me, told me he misses me and I carried on pleading. He said he needs until Wednesday (3 days away) till decide. What do I do? I can‚Äôt imagine life without him and I‚Äôm really struggling to deal with everything. Please give me advice. I love him and want to spend my life with him.",Smooth-Strain4515,1,1690715451.0,1.0,7324,1465,7324

"How do I become a real person? So I realized after looking at all these profiles over years and years, and reading all these posts about what to do, what not to do. My issue is that I‚Äôm not a real person. My profile just has selfies and pictures of my cats. Real people actually take pictures when they are out with their friends or accomplish something big or go somewhere cool. 

For that matter, real people go out with their friends, accomplish big things and go cool places. I don‚Äôt really do any of those things. I don‚Äôt enjoy my life. 

In fact, I kind of hate myself. I showed as much when 10 years ago as a teen I sliced up my arm. Of course I‚Äôm better now. I‚Äôve spent so much money on therapy and doing all the right things. I have hobbies; I have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù; I work myself to death in the gym; I take my meds; I am finishing a graduate degree. And yet, nothing I do can ever remove that massive red flag from my body. It can never make me a real person again. And you can‚Äôt be in a relationship with someone who is not real, at least not for very long or if they aren‚Äôt obscenely good looking. I mean I‚Äôm not ugly, but not good looking enough to make up for the red flags. 

It‚Äôs a bit of a vicious cycle. I hate myself because I‚Äôm not a real person, but I can‚Äôt become a real person until I stop hating myself.",MathtutoringCT,1,1690835802.0,1.0,1321,262,1321

"NBSB at 22 Hello everyone, I am F(22) about to graduate from Uni and start living my life as an adult soon. I won't say it's embarrassing but I don't have any experience in dating and never had been intimate with a guy because I focused solely on school. I didn't fancy putting a lot of effort to what I look like before and just lived off life as a student who works hard. However, these past three years I started paying attention to what I look like and invested greatly on myself. I'd say I love how it made me feel really because I think it made me confident and happy looking at myself in the mirror. It also made me feminine, which is another delight all in itself. I discovered I like being girly girly... wearing dresses, necklaces, and fancying make up too. I started getting a lot of compliments and admirers out of nowhere. I've never received them before in all honesty and it makes me warm hearing them. I'm not exactly lonely because I think I'm pretty established emotionally (being single all these years) but I wanted to enter the dating scene and try being with other people's company aside from myself now that I'm pretty fine with who I am. Now, I'm kind of traditional and don't want hook ups or any of the sort. I just want someone who's up for the long term and who wants to build a possible future with me. So this goes that I don't want someone who'll just play around. Now the real issue arises, am I likely to be taken advantage of because of my zero experience in dating? Do guys still want someone like me who might be ignorant to the ups and downs of a relationship as given to never experiencing one?

I recently started talking to a middle eastern man (im Italian) and we have a five year age gap im 30 he‚Äôs 35. But the weirdest thing just happened and I was wondering if I could get any insight into the situation. 

We were on FaceTime and when I hung up I said ‚Äòk bye‚Äô not in a sassy way that‚Äôs just how I always hang up the phone k bye! but right after I said that he was saying no! But I had already pressed end call. 

I get a text shortly after saying that when you hang up the phone u don‚Äôt say goodbye u say ciao see you later or talk later. He was dead serious.

"Am I doomed? So, probably a fairly common query on here but here goes...

Years ago when I think I was at university this girl followed me on Instagram. I didn't follow her back as didn't know her but she's always been active in viewing my stories etc, kinda odd. Out the blue after like 10 years she messaged me and we got chatting, just friendly really. She then mentioned she was moving away for work and asked if I wanted to continue or meet before she went? I politely declined and said it wasn't really what I was after... (She just wanted to have some fun I think)
She then suggests I speak to her friend who she showed my photo to and said she recognised me from a dating app years ago and that she liked how I looked. 

I got speaking to her, seems really nice but is a little guarded ( won't give out socials) due to bad post experiences so we are chatting on Skype messages lmao. 

She is legit, really pretty, smart and interesting. Kind of out of my league I feel. I think she is fairly experienced in dating so probably isn't nervous.

I on the other hand have been single most my life with only a few times really putting myself out there but only when something falls in my lap really, kinda like this situation. Without trying to be cocky, I'd say I'm decent, I'm 6'5, look ok, in ok shape, good professional job and good chat when around people I know, bit of a softie.. All my mates and their wives can't understand why I'm single and try to set me up so they think I'm a catch for their friends enough to recommend... but when it comes to dating I just get kinda nervous, as if I'm going to talk Infront a crowd of 1000 people. So I've made it all this way kinda not doing much and just avoiding feeling uncomfortable. But I'm fully aware this is holding me back in life and I want to change it.

I really like this girl but just feel that when we meet my nerves will get the better of me and it will overshadow who I am and what she's grown to like and she'll end up bolting. We are planning to meet soon.

Anyone for any advice for me?",TakeTheLift,1,1690732851.0,1.0,2057,400,2057
"Should I confess to my long-distance friend of three years that I have feelings for him or just let it go? I really don't know what to do and I really need your honest advice. This is my first time writing here, never in my life I thought I would do this, but here I am. I've been reading stuff for a while and I enjoyed it. I am having second thoughts about confessing to my friend so I thought maybe I should ask for some advice. Backstory, we met online and we became good friends, you know we talked every week sometimes we call. Then I got into a relationship and surprisingly, we're still friends. My ex and I broke and it destroyed me so much and he was there. He's one of my support systems who helped me a lot during those times. I got back up again and now I'm happy with my life, still on that healing journey but I am better now. I denied to myself that I was having feelings for him for a lot of times because I thought maybe I just carried away because he's always there for me through ups and downs and maybe because he's giving me attention. As time passed by, my feelings were going deeper and now I'm sure. The thing is, he's in Europe and I am in Asia, we haven't met yet, but I know what I am feeling is real. I want to keep this friendship for this lifetime, that's how much I am grateful for our friendship. But now, I am afraid I might ruin it because of my feelings. üòî I don't know if I should keep it to myself forever because I feel like that's me lying to myself. 

He told me about his new co-worker and he told me he finds her pretty and nice. He said he doesn't like her nor have a crush on her. He's just curious about her and wants to know more. He wants to talk with her and see where it goes. It breaks my heart but I can't say anything. So, would it be selfish of me to confess to him now? I just want to confess so I won't hurt myself anymore because of regrets. I know there will be a possibility of him dating her, so maybe before that happens I will just try to confess so that I'll have peace of mind too. But, I am scared. I want to keep this friendship forever, but I am afraid that my feelings will ruin it. 

What should I do? I am desperately asking for help now. I am sorry, I hope you guys will have a nice day and thank you too!

"I want to date again but I still feel hurt from my ex. So I dumped my ex like a year and three months ago. We've been together for 7 years and dated for 2.

Eventually I left her for being too disrespectful and insulting towards me. Essentially she was using me to vent and always had anger attacks that needed therapy.

Of course, she met and bragged about her new guy 2 weeks after the fact. And looking back on it. She reached out to me after an abusive ex dumper a couple of weeks prior. So I was a rebound that became long term and worked for the most part.

It's been a long time since all that mess. I waited with hopes for her to return for eleven months and just stopped waiting for her like a month ago.

Nevertheless, I know I'm not ready to date again just yet. 

The pain I feel is more so the realization of what type of person she really is. And I feel... Dissapointed by who she turned out to be and by how much I loved her.

I did have a rebound like 2 months after we broke up but It was only for like a week and that girl is now my best friend.

I am of the belief that love is not looked for. It's found. Love comes to you. So I won't go on dating apps or anything. Neither would I try to utilize a new relationship to replace my pain. (Like my ex did.) I just don't know if It's ok to date if my wounds are of dissapointment. I know I will continue to lament the bad ending of this chapter until I start the new chapter. But am I ok? I don't want to bore my new partner with my ex. But at the same time, It's a wound I'd like to share. It really has done a number in me.

I want to be fair. To be a healthy boyfriend who gives his all and have a girl that offers the same. To carry each other when one is down and to walk this life together. To laugh and sacrifice.

I know I'm not ready, quite yet. But it's been plenty of time. And I do not know if this level of wound is acceptable for a new beggining. What can you tell me?",Joseph18Gamer,1,1690835317.0,1.0,1948,402,1948
"I need advice getting over him Please somebody speak some sense into me.

Me (26F) and my ex (27M) ended things about a month ago and despite blocking him on social media, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him every single day.

We started out as friends that lived only a few minutes away from each other. He mentioned he had his eye on me for a while but was in a relationship that ended in January. By March we started talking and met up at parks for walks and bonded over our love for nature and physical activity. 
We started hanging out multiple times a week, working out together, me going to his house to study while he would work next to me or we would watch TV and eat dinner together.
I got sick and he showed up at my house with food and medicine. I blurted out ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù from being overcome with emotions from his tender care towards me.

This guy from the beginning was everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a partner. Intelligent but humble, hard working but also fun and goofy. He has the most beautiful smile and told me I was precious to him. He said I was unlike any other woman he‚Äôd ever known platonically or romantically. That I was ‚Äúall in one‚Äù and my curiosity to learn and intelligence also attracted him. He also thought I was hilarious‚Ä¶ in a way it felt like we mirrored each other. He told me he loved me. He would never say no to me and constantly found ways to take me out, to plan ahead, to invite me to things to do. I met all his friends, his parents. He met my son and my friends as well.
Our sex life was spectacular, he took pride in my pleasure and we both enjoyed each other in a very loving, accepting ways despite our flaws and all. Like when a man kisses and gently touches the parts of you you don‚Äôt like about yourself type of thing. I fell so deep for him. 

Then as we started dating and 3 months was coming up, I asked him where he saw us going. If he was happy? How did he feel? General check in I like to do to see if there is long term compatibility and if we are both on the same page logically (not just emotional honey moon)

He said he didn‚Äôt see himself with kids around yet. And by kids I knew he meant my son. He wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted that life. 

This broke me. In the moment I appreciated his honesty, so I looked at him and I could not stop crying. He cried, we hugged, he comforted me as I sobbed for what felt like an eternity in his arms. I felt anger‚Ä¶ I started feeling anger from my heart and pain as he held me delicately. I was angry at the fact he knew this all along and him being an analytical, intelligent, logical person I was angry at the fact he wasted my time. Why court me, why date me, why make me fall for him just to not‚Ä¶.. you get it‚Ä¶.

I pushed him away and I left. I spent the next week crying and with no appetite. I fucked up with not cutting him off and being strong when he came around and wanted a friendship. It‚Äôs like we just went back to the beginning when we would meet up by the lake in the evenings for a walk and chat

One fateful night I regrettably found myself sleeping with him again‚Ä¶. It was even better sex than before. He is my favorite sexual partner I‚Äôve ever had and I just needed to feel the intensity that having him felt. Things with him always felt deep, like he could see me for all of me and fully accept me. 

Weeks pass and I realize he is winning at this new FWB. I realized I could not go on as we met up one last time for a chat, he brought me flowers. I told him I need to cut him off. 

This is w the important part: in the beginning, he admitted going through my entire follow list on IG and looked at all the other men that could be interested in me. He admitted he thinks way too much about everything and his brain never shuts off. His previous partner also cheated on him.
Personally, I used to be the girl who did that too but to preserve my heart I have stopped checking follow lists because it creates assumptions and more questions instead of closure.

One man specifically bothered him. A young athlete from my local gym who is quite famous. I had mentioned to him while we were friends this athlete slid in my DMs to hangout. I also rambled to him how that athlete has no chance with me due to his arrogant and player personality. I‚Äôm well aware the guy is just looking for hookups so I left him on read. But I see him at the gym and we have a similar friend circle so when I do see him in person we don‚Äôt talk o each other or interact. Ex picks a fight with me because I liked some of the athletes picture on IG and to him it meant I‚Äôm accepting his advances.  I told him if I wanted that guy that bad I would‚Äôve already met him but I never felt the desire to. The ‚Äúcome over for Netflix and chill‚Äù guys is not what I go for.


Anyways, ex questioned my thought process and frankly there was nothing else to say so I just forgot about it. This incident with that man was enough for ex to say he didn‚Äôt want to be friends either.  I got angry and told him it‚Äôs none of his business who I follow on social media or what I do now after he was the one to reject me first. He says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and I told him to F off.

To cut the rambling short, I‚Äôve been heartbroken and doing no contact but he just reached out again to go see him for a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù. I wanted to not respond but deep down I want to talk about everything. However the thought gh of seeing him and even just seeing his name pop up on my phone fills me with sadness and anxiety. So I said ‚ÄúI need more time‚Äù. 

There is nothing I can do‚Ä¶ I need space to move on as he shattered the future I saw for us. Kids and family are something I highly value. And he wasn‚Äôt interested in that future with me so I left. I‚Äôd love to be his friend one day but right now I have too many feelings. I miss him daily, I have dreams about him and then he magically texts me first thing the next day. I even ran into him when we both stopped. By our local breakfast spot. 
We sat down together and ate, chatted, he even took a look at my car for me as it‚Äôs been having issues‚Ä¶ he would send me money to take my son out on the Weeknd‚Äôs.

Please speak some sense into me. He‚Äôs blocked on all social media. I even moved as well..",itizwhatitizlmao,1,1690725864.0,1.0,6186,1235,6186
"New relationship, can I trust him or is he cheating on me? I've been dating a guy for about four months and we've fallen hard for each other. We spend a lot of time together and there is absolutely nothing that makes me question his feelings for me, besides this one thing. We're very intens and passionate together. We spoke about what we were and we agreed on having a monogamous relationship. I also met some of his friends recently. He's a very vain and extraverted man who needs a lot of validation from other people and I  myself have some issues with trusting men. Bad combo in that area I guess.

I never had doubts about his intentions, until I found out recently he was still active on a dating app. He didn't tell me, I found out. We talked about it as grown ups, because I didn't want to throw everything away that was good. Asked why he felt the need to use it and he needed the validation. He was curious. He deleted the app, no further issues about it. 

Only now I realize that my trust has gone to bare minimum. He's on a holiday with friends in the middle of nowhere. They go hiking. And well I had this bad gut feeling he was going to install the dating app again. Now I noticed he has way more followers on Instagram, only from 1 day abroad. He on the other hand doesn't follow back. I know it's not healthy to check these kind of things, but my gut feeling never failed me in the past. And well, he gave me a reason to distrust. So I need advice on this one. First of all, am I overreacting? How can I found out, because he probably won't tell me if I ask. Just what should I do... Or am I being naive? I just can't handle the idea that someone is lying to me...",Excellent-Bench-2545,1,1690725588.0,0.67,1683,328,1683
"I‚Äôm assuming I should give up? Hey guys. 
Since around 6 weeks ago, me and this girl I met on tinder really hit things off. We seemed to work really well with one another, like as if we knew each other for years beforehand. Nonetheless, the past week or two have been different. She started by seeming more blunt, and defensive over things - such as when I give her advice or something which she doesn‚Äôt want. I was fine with this. But since then, she has stated she wanted to take things slow due to her past relationships being difficult and even abusive, so she needed time to prepare and get herself ready for me. This too, I was fine with.

But. That was only the beginning. Since then, she became more and more blunt, slower and worse replies etc. and the second I question it, she gets super defensive and annoyed, and thus becomes overall worse with me. So, to cut a long story short, I‚Äôm now at a point where she isn‚Äôt able to meet for a month due to how ‚Äúbusy‚Äù she is, and she hasn‚Äôt even replies to any of my messages today.

For context, we had met up around 6 times, and the dates were always great. She never took advantage of me, and I never did of her either. It seemed perfect.",Alert_Career4922,1,1690725576.0,1.0,1194,229,1194
"Who is more wrong in the my relationship or are we both morally grey and weirdly functional So my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 6 months, but she doesn‚Äôt seem interested in the relationship really, to the point where she keeps getting my name confused with ones that sound like it. She‚Äôs also been cheating on me, but I am not upset because I am just dating her to pacify my parents since she is very charming and they didn‚Äôt approve of my previous gf and were the reason we broke up, though we are also still seeing each other and technically cheating. I believe the only reason my gf is dating me is because her sister set us up on a blind date and she didn‚Äôt know that I was her sister's childhood bestfriend. When my gf got told that information, she kind of looked scared, I think because she also only went on the date to pacify her sister but couldn‚Äôt back out of dating me since my friend (her sister) is very overprotective of me and would‚Äôve gone crazy on her. I know this because I overheard her talking to her friends saying how she doesn‚Äôt count what she‚Äôs doing as cheating because she feels backed into a corner and never wanted a relationship in the first place since she doesn‚Äôt do commitment or feelings. Normally If I heard that I would be a little iffy but how can I judge when I won‚Äôt breakup with the girl when I know she feels sort of trapped and am just using her as place holder till the timing‚Äôs right for me and my ex. So does anyone think that there is a person in the wrong in this situation? Neither one of us is abusive or mean towards the other; I think we enjoy each other‚Äôs company somewhat and the sex is great. We have an okay relationship other than the fact that she‚Äôs waiting for me to break up with her so she doesn‚Äôt get the heat from her sister, and I am waiting for the right time to break things off so that I can get back together with my previous GF. I know we are both wrong in our own ways and both should grow a back bone and breakup with one another but I think honestly maybe I should just tell her the whole deal. I feel like she would be fine and probably relieved that I want to be with someone else and we could fake date until the time is right which I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôd be fine with as well.",Mysterious___Man,1,1690725268.0,1.0,2275,444,2275
"No second dates Hi I am 34 F , recently divorced, I have been going on these first dates with many men in past few months but I never get a single text afterwards from these men and they just disappear from my life. If I text them asking how they are doing etc , they do give me reply a polite reply back and thats it . It never goes anywhere after that. 

I am starting to wonder that What I am doing wrong on these first dates that I am not getting a single second date. After analyzing everything ,i think they might be turned off by my reluctance to take things physically forward so quickly. I am Indian and all these guys are Indian too so they know already I would not be moving to physical stuff so quickly. 

Another thing might be that they were shorter than they claimed to be in their profiles. I am 5‚Äô8 and in their profiles they mentioned they were 5‚Äô10 and above but in reality they were even shorter than me. I honestly had no problem even though they were lying but they were visibly uncomfortable about my height saying they didn‚Äôt expect me to be this tall. Claiming I am lying about my height , that its 5‚Äô10 or 5‚Äô11 at least. 

I also went on date with few men who dm me on instagram. They said that I look older in person than my pictures on Instagram. They said they liked my 5 years old pictures on Instagram and complained why I didn‚Äôt look like that anymore. I told I post my recent picture everyweek so they should have set their expectations accordingly. Nevertheless it had made me very insecure about my present looks.I cannot be as good looking as my 20 something old self. It is making me even more depressed .

What should I do different? I feel I should not go on date with random men but talk to them beforehand for a while see if I like them an then go on date.",Careless_Bill7604,1,1690724818.0,0.99,1797,349,1797
"Need advice to approach a girl at workplace Hey all, I'm fairly new here, but I hope I'll get good advice here.  
  
I'm a 25 yr old guy working at a MNC in India. So I've never really been much into dating and stuff, but since a couple of months or more maybe, there's this girl at my workplace that I seem to be infatuated with. We work in different departments and don't have any mutual friends, the only place I see her is in cafeteria and that too with her gang of friends. I have observed that we both make a lot of eye contact and then suddenly look away, and I somehow feel she maybe interested as well, although might be wrong. About me, I look decent, have good height and personality (at least that's what I think), and am confident enough to be able to talk to girls and guys alike. I'm a bit of in between the old-school and modern gen kind of authentic yet adaptive guy. I think she is my kind as well at least based on what I observe and seems mature like me as well, who's not looking for anything casual but something meaningful.  
  
Now I am confused if and when should I approach her because she is always with her gang of friends so I don't get a chance to approach 1-1 even if I'm confident to approach. Also I'm not sure if I'm in hurry and I should give it more time and whether or not she might like it given she seems a bit of shy person as compared to me. Also given it's not college and we're in office, I can't ruin my (or her) career just because I couldn't hold my horses.  
I'd appreciate if men and women in this forum could help me out on when and how should I get a chance to talk 1-1 with her and how fast/slow should I take the conversations. I'm fine if she rejects my proposals and won't care to bother her or spam her again if she rejects me, but want to give a shot anyway, since I've never had such strong feelings for a girl before.  
  
PS: I want to date her with an intention of marriage. I understand that not all dating or relationships end up in marriage and I'm fine if later we figure out it won't work for some reason (like my first college date from few years ago), but the intention is not just short-term but for long lasting meaningful relationship that would lead us to spending lives together.

I‚Äôm awkward when it comes to introducing myself. Once I get to know someone it‚Äôs easier to get into a good conversation. But I suck at flirting out of nowhere.

"i don't know how to start again Its been 7 months since my first break up and I'm really struggling. My first love felt like it would never end and i didn't phrase it like it but i essentially told my then partner that they'd probably be my first and last, which looking back on is immature i know but i now feel like ive trapped myself in this promise that i feel too guilty to break. I also told myself i'd wait for a reaallly long time before i started dating again because during the height of the heartbreak i just found so many things wrong in a relationship i used to find so amazing, so i decided i was too immature and should take a good long break. But, there's a new person who is so sweet and lovely and they make me wanna try again, i love spending time with them and i genuinely think I'm falling in love again. Again, this may be such an immature take but I've never understood why other people date again after such heartbreak and pain, why should I give me heart away again after the uncertainty of losing another person?  I love really hard and earnestly and being vunerable with someone just to lose them again honestly scares me. I honestly just think I'm torn between trying this whole ordeal again with someone who I'm really falling hard in love with, yet breaking all of the rules and promises i subconsciously hold myself accountable for or moving on and missing out on this person.

"28 [M] getting mixed signals from 24 [F] So I met this girl at the bar and we hit it off pretty well, extremely good chemistry and our humor similar. We agree to take things slow, we hug, cuddle, give eachother massages and light touching for about two months. Last week she calls me and says that she asks what I'm into sexually, she tells me she enjoys being a brat and thrown around etc.

I told her I enjoy being more dominating in bed and she says that im just saying that to get her aroused. Well she comes over and we're hanging out and she asks how to turn on my shower, so I take that as my queue and before I know it we're making out and touching eachother. This leads to us having rough sex and I finished in her hair which she was not okay with.

Afterwards we had dinner and I paid, we walked around for a bit and she decides to stay over at a friend's because she said she wants to hang out with her pet. I told her that's fine and decided to walk her there since it's about a mile away in a rough part of town.

She called me the next day and said that what happened last night was not okay and I came on way too strong, I told her I'm sorry but that's what she said she was into. She admitted she did talk a big talk but I was being selfish but she didn't like being degraded and vulnerable like that. She felt she needed to say this instead of things becoming awkward, but that situation can never happen again. 

I feel terrible about this and I haven't spoken with her since Saturday, I feel like the appropriate thing I need to do is give her space for now.",Throwadateway11,1,1690835745.0,1.0,1577,314,1577

"Is it unethical to hook up with a different girl after a single date? My friend's sister came to my house to help clean my room. After, we got ice cream and I paid. She was really generous to offer to clean my room. I think she might have romantic feelings for me. I also do for her. The only issue is that she is my friend's sister, and I don't want to harm our friendship if something were to happen. I probably won't continue anything romantic with her because of this. 


I also have a FWB that hit me up asking to hook up tonight. I might feel a little guilty because my friend's sister was really generous to me and she might like me.

"Why do ppl do this/How can I handle this gracefully? Why are some ppl like this? Also how tf do I handle things gracefully.

I attended a martial arts training camp about a month ago. It was a big one with ppl flying in from across the country and international too. Met lots of ppl there including one girl from BC who seemed very friendly. She first asked for my number just to help give rides to her friends who needed transportation to and from the venue. But then started texting random questions (shit you can easily google), added me on my socials, randomly messaged me on them.

She knows I'm in a relationship already with someone else (it's literally on my fb page and my profile pic is if me and my gf). I made no secret of my gf when she added me on my socials. Said to her face ""that's my gf."" But she keeps messaging me on my socials. Shit like ""hey u up?"" Or liking and commenting on my insta stories.

"Girl I was messaging stopped replying Long and short of it: I (22m) matched with a girl (22f) on tinder.

We sent 3 or so more messages, and every time I sent one she liked it (the little heart react tinder has).

But then after that (two to three days, 1-2 texts a day) she stopped responding.

"How does any guy afford hookups in the modern dating scene?? Fired up tinder after a long term relationship went south, so decided to get out there and have some short term fun. I make it clear that i just got out of a relationship, which for some matches is fine. I know the vast majority of women my age (34M) are only looking to date to get married and have kids, and dating after 30 gets infinitely gets more difficult for men, however there are still some fringe cases where single guys somehow manage to get laid without any commitments. 

Seeing how im not filthy rich and lack a six pack, and after filtering out all the single mothers, the matches filtered in slowly. However taking these women out on dates is getting ridiculously pricey. 100-200$ dinner dates with drinks might not seem too expensive at first, but they add up over time. Expensive professional alternatives seem to be making more and more financial sense especially with the caliber of single women over 30, but I don‚Äôt want to go that route. I live in the suburbs so taking any potential date home is an hour long endeavor, which would involve expensive Ubers. 

Do all these hookup stories on Reddit involve people in their late teens or early 20‚Äôs that makes hookups seem so trivially easy? I set my age range from 20-40 but of course no woman under 30 will go out with a guy in their early to mid 30‚Äôs unless they have a financial incentive to do so. 

It‚Äôs been a few months and I‚Äôve wasted upwards of 2-3k$ and tens of hours of my time with absolutely nothing to show for it.

We go to the same university, and the summer break is almost over, so she'll be back soon. I'm afraid to meet her by coincidence at university because she hasn't responded to my messages, even though I've tried to talk to her and resolve things. I opened up to her about a lot of things, and it was the first time I felt in love with someone.  
  
She was the first girl I ever introduced to my family, and I had never felt this way for someone before. I was aware that I was giving more than I was receiving, but she was open with me too. She told me things that she doesn't share with other people, like her traumas and family problems. I can't help but care about her.  
  
Before she went to Mexico, she talked to me about how she felt like she couldn't be a good partner for anyone. Of course, I was honest and told her that I was willing to make things work with her, and that we would figure it out. She made me happier than I already was.  
  
But at that moment, something changed. I felt like she was looking for an excuse to be distant or to just walk away. She was inconsistent with her behaviour, sometimes praising me and other times finding something wrong with everything I did.  
  
She went to Mexico, and she was really busy and barely even texted, let alone talked. I told her that I thought it would be best for both of us to focus on ourselves while we were apart, and she got mad and told me that I was confusing her and she was tired of the same old thing. (I felt like this was just an excuse.)  
  
She hasn't responded to my texts, but she hasn't blocked me on social media either. She watches my stories, and she even liked a picture I posted on my stories a while ago.  
  
Since that day, she hasn't talked to me. The summer break is almost over, and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid and anxious. The last time I saw her in person, we had an amazing date. Now look at us.  
  
Any advice would be appreciated.",andermendz1,1,1690843518.0,1.0,2230,427,2230
"Relationship pet peeves? Anything that can make you go from chill to absolutely livid? For me, the one thing that sets me the fuck off the most is being hung up on. Idc what your excuse is, unless it‚Äôs an sudden emergency, it‚Äôs extremely hurtful. To me when the other person hangs up the phone on me is the ultimate form of disrespect besides cheating. It hurts a ton and it shows they dont give a shit. My bf just did that. What sets you off? How do I handle my situation? He apologized profusely afterwards over text immediately after when I told him to leave me alone because he hurt me. This is long distance, and we‚Äôre adults. (21F, 25M).

How do you find people who are understanding? I (26m) have recently identified with the help of my therapist that the kind of person I would be looking to date is probably going to need to be someone who is understanding/compassionate. The reason for this is I‚Äôm a often a misunderstood person who is passed off because of my parents success or because of other reasons. What I‚Äôm trying to understand is what are some qualities or some indicators that someone is understanding or compassionate when it comes to dating. One of the ideas I had is that maybe someone‚Äôs job can suggest that they might be a more understanding person but it‚Äôs also entirely possible that is not true as well. I‚Äôm leaning towards thinking that some teachers might be more understanding types. If this is the case what sort of jobs and or hobbies would someone who is understanding do? Also what are some of the qualities that might stand out in someone who is understanding? Thanks,Upeanut,1,1690843720.0,1.0,958,169,958
"Zero game and I‚Äôm fine with it I guess. Sincerely, I know I‚Äôm smart, I know I look good. But my financial struggles, my mental health struggles and my career path makes it impossible to date. 

Thankfully I‚Äôm far enough in my therapy process to not take my dry spell personally, 2 years ago I‚Äôd be wondering if I‚Äôm not pretty enough/smart enough that I‚Äôm in my end 20s and not engaged yet? I‚Äôll be turning 30 this year and I‚Äôm like, I‚Äôll probably end up alone and I have to be fine with it, because I‚Äôm tired to be miserable about tying my happiness and self worth onto my relationship status. It‚Äôs not worth it. 

All I do is work, study, go the gym and alongside of that, take care of my depression,worry about my financial status, make time for my friends and my family. How am I suppose to make time for the next guy who will be thrilled for the max of 6 weeks about me until he goes on to the next one and starts slowly ghosting me, while I have to deal silently with the mental toll of yet another failed situationship. There‚Äôs no way in hell. 

And yes, I have to put this out in the world to remind myself and not be upset about the fact that I‚Äôm not even talking to someone rn and the last time I had sex is more than a year ago. Damn. Haha",miaunzgenau,1,1690843912.0,1.0,1249,246,1249
Im terrified i got her prenant after the first time Me (17) and my gf (19) just had sex yesterday and Im absolutely terrified that I got her pregnant. I bought extra safe comdoms just to be sure but now Im second guessing everything. We went at it for about 5 min when i came. Then we opened the second condom but i put it on wrong so we got rid of it. And the third one i put it on correctly but my penis was a little soft and had a little trouble putting the condom on. It didnt come off or anything but Im so scared bc i didnt clean my sperm off after the first nut and maybe that did me in? Im so anxious that i cant sleep and i live in a country that does not allow abortions or even plan b. So if the condom failed i have no choice. The fear of my parents finding out and raising a kid at 17 is so nerve-wracking. Im so fucking scared and need some reassurance or advice on how to calm my overthinking as well as my next steps,sebysyt22,1,1690847748.0,0.99,932,194,932

"Celebrity Crushes So there's this girl that i've talking too for almost two years. We're in the stage where we act like we're together but neither one of us wants to admit it.

Everything is fine, but when she starts mentioning all these celebrity crushes and fantasies is when it makes me think differently. She always send me tiktok's and video about drake, 21 savage, justin bieber, all the above. Or just other guys on Tiktok. And she always says ""my man my man"". 

In my previous relationship, one of the reasons my ex didn't like me is because i didn't have dreads like a certain rapper. It doesn't hurt my feelings as much as it did before, but when this new girl sends me all these guys, it makes me feel like i'm not enough, or never gonna be enough. Almost like a PTSD moment.

"What's the Psychology Behind Slow Texting? I don't understand slow texters at all. Either I want to talk to someone instantly, or I  don'tvwant to talk to them at all; so when I get a text, I immediately read it and respond, usually within a couple of minutes of it being sent--sometimes only seconds. I'll then carry through the conversation to a natural stopping point. Or, if it's a text I don't want to answer, I'll block that person.

This is my procedure with friends, partners, and even mere acquaintances. I do this even though I'm a fairly busy person with responsibilities, and I don't find it at all difficult to respond promptly to everyone. Texting an eloquent and fitting response is not hard if you have any readiness with language. It takes mere seconds.

Compare this with a young woman I've been seeing. She'll text asking me how my day is on Thursday. I'll respond within a minute or two, and she won't text back (or even read my message) till Sunday afternoon. This is something she does repeatedly. It's fine for her to not want to talk, but why text me at all if you aren't interested in my response? 

Can anyone explain the thinking behind this kind of texting behavior? I can't even begin to wrap my mind around it. ",Snoo-93317,1,1690845910.0,1.0,1241,223,1241

"IDEK I (26F) have been seeing a man (24M) for a few months. I am the first serious person he‚Äôs pursued since a messy breakup with his ex of 4 years a few years ago. Since then he‚Äôs been with 2 other girls, nothing serious, had sex with them a few times then they went their separate ways then he met me. He assumed it‚Äôd be like that but I stuck around and he really likes me. He used to live local but moved away for work, about 12 hours away. We are both apprehensive about getting into a relationship since ours was messy and hurt. Before he left we were getting really close and I helped him pack and it was really emotional, he said saying goodbye to me was very hard for him. He is depressed where he lives now and I have see an obvious decline in his personality. I visited him this weekend and asked him if he was losing feelings. Convos seem mundane and I feel like a distraction. I asked him this and he responds; ‚ÄúI see my friends going through life and I‚Äôm here. I see people living their lives and I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt do anything, I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on life. You aren‚Äôt a distraction, well kind of, not in the bad way you think. You pull me out of this and keep me grounded. You bring me back home. You are the one thing that keeps me out of the bad headspace. I battle myself with you. You‚Äôre everything I wanted in a partner, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, it‚Äôs me.

He used to be super against cuddling, hand holding, etc., saying it made him anxious but now we do that and he‚Äôs fine. He told me that he stopped making the relationship between us super sexual, bc we used to sext a looooooot when he first got there, he said his last relationship was based on sex and wanted something deeper this time. He keeps saying if we date blah blah blah, like romanticizing the idea, like after we had that talk. I‚Äôm so confused. Idk if he‚Äôs saying he just likes me as a friend, not romantically, or if he needs things to move slower, he told me I move fast which I do. I just don‚Äôt know.

"fwb suddenly seems distant and jealous??? 
very long but i (24F) have a really close friend (23M) and i think I might be ruining our friendship? we met years ago (2017) and started off in a bit of a talking stage and definitely had major chemistry/liked each other but lived in different places so nothing came of it. We just kinda evolved into friends and talked pretty much every day for a couple of years, but his ex started coming back in the picture and didn‚Äôt want him to talk to me anymore so we didn‚Äôt speak for about a year or so. 

A couple of years ago we ran into each other and started talking every day again like nothing happened. We‚Äôre almost never in the same place and we‚Äôve always been flirtatious but in mostly a joking way and one thing we‚Äôve always done is talk super openly about other people we were seeing/hooking up with etc. and gave each other advice.

Fast forward to the last month or so and we were finally in the same area and hung out a couple of times one weekend with other friends and (according to everyone around us) were completely inseparable the whole time we were all out. It was kinda surprising that we were only paying attention to each other bc one thing we‚Äôve always joked about is how we get in trouble in relationships bc we flirt with people too much and ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with different people every time we go out. Apparently everyone we were around actually assumed we were dating bc of our body language, and when a I told a few people that we were just friends they were shocked and I thought it was funny and joked about it with him a lot.

We ended up hooking up for the first time since 2017 that weekend and everything still seemed normal, but the next weekend we ended up going on an overnight trip alone to see a concert together and hooked up again a couple of times. It definitely got kinda romantic at points and I had an incredible time but during a lot of the trip I felt a kinda weird tension between us almost like he didn‚Äôt know if he was allowed to be ‚Äúromantic‚Äù with me or touch me etc. I actually brought it up while I was drunk that night and he said he was nervous about making me uncomfortable and then I straight up asked what he felt was going on between us. We both agreed that we obviously have a very serious emotional connection and a mutual attraction but neither of us are interested in a relationship (he‚Äôs emotionally recovering from a breakup and I honestly just enjoy being single). We also don‚Äôt live in the same state so *i* left that convo feeling like everything was normal and that nothing between us had changed.

Fast forward to the last couple of weeks and I think that ‚Ä¶something between us changed. I still talk with him like I always did about other guys n our antics and he‚Äôs seemed kinda shady about it recently? Like joking about being jealous and he‚Äôs never done that before, but I know that he‚Äôs told me over the years that he can be jealous and insecure about girls he likes. It‚Äôs a little annoying bc even though I obviously have feelings for him to an extent, exploring anything other than friendship when we‚Äôre not together is pointless. I also know (or maybe assume) he‚Äôs planning on hooking up with other girls in the future and is super active on dating apps and I genuinely don‚Äôt care. The only boundary I set was that if we‚Äôre together physically we shouldn‚Äôt hook up with other people around each other and he agreed. I also at one point asked if it was weird for him when I talked about other guys (bc I can totally respect that) but he just ignored that and started talking about something else.

I‚Äôve always been incredibly oblivious when it comes to recognizing when guys actually like me and have actually lost a couple of friends over the years after making out with/hooking up w them bc I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal and they ended up being hurt. He‚Äôs one of my favorite people to talk to and spend time with so I really don‚Äôt want to ruin it, but I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overthinking things or if he actually has more feelings for me than I thought.

TL;DR‚Äîa good friend and I hooked up a few times and acknowledge that we‚Äôre attracted to each other but there‚Äôs no possibility of a relationship between us. I thought our friendship would stay the same, but now I‚Äôm worried that I might have misread his feelings and now I think he might actually like me more than I thought and want to know if I might just be overthinking the situation",Intelligent_Hunter37,1,1690841118.0,1.0,4460,835,4460

She's very good looking and I've always fancied her, however we've had very little interaction in the two years that I've been there. She would smile at me if we made eye contact and had the occasional verbal exchange but really that's it.

Given that I'm out most of the day, I don't see her very often anyway and we have rarely if ever had a real opportunity to stop and chat. It hasn't helped that there were sometimes periods of weeks and even months when I didn't see her at all.

Context: We already had sex in 2019, and he came over to my house twice and stayed the night.

  
The problem is that we're talking now, but he still hasn't asked me out on a date. I don't want anything serious; actually, I just want to have some fun and silly adventures, lol. I would have thought that if he wasn't interested, he would just stop sending me texts or replying to my stories. But he's always there (always). Now it's practically August, and still nothing. He flirts with me, wants to have sex, etc., etc. We do have fun chatting sometimes. But nothing happens outside of it, even though I've already suggested it to him, and he gave me an excuse. However, he suggested that one day he should come to my house. But for us to go on a date, he doesn't have the time, lol. I've already called him out on this, and he said that's fair, we should go out on a date. But... nothing. Yet he still talks to me every day.

  
While I was writing this down, I was thinking, Damn, how stupid am I... but seriously. He is so hot. He is attractive. He has a huge d\* lol. I don't want a boyfriend; I just want some fun. But he is a walking red flag.

Not fwb not a date not just a 1 night stand nothing. I've tried dating apps like bumble tinder and hinge oh and fb dating. I get no matches and no one knows anyone aparently. What gives?

I block people after rejection F[21] So after going on several first dates for a bit I‚Äôve turned down several people and kinda regularly I‚Äôve had them lowkey or highkey harrase me after I reject them so I started to block immediately after a rejection text even if I had a good time to avoid being said something nasty cause I didn‚Äôt want to continue communicating with them. Today I rejected a guy and blocked him (it was a good date just I didn‚Äôt feel a connection and I didn‚Äôt want to lead him on (which I did say in the text) and blocked after I sent it) about 3 hours later he messages me on my Instagram (that I don‚Äôt remember giving him) and he asks me and kinda gives me flack about it too so I gave him a brief reason why. Ik I technically don‚Äôt owe him an explanation but still. Do other people do this?

"Perception of therapy in early stages I (hetero F) was having a chat with two friends (male and female) and therapy came up in the context of dating... me and my female friend agreed that if a man we're dating shares that he's in therapy, our response to that is 'a green flag'; whereas the male friend said that if a girl tells him she's in therapy, his response would be 'a red flag'.

I recently went on a date with someone I met on Hinge, we both agreed that it was a great time and wanted to see each other again, as we were texting I indirectly mentioned that I was in therapy, in response to 'how was your day?'. Since then, he responded my messages at a significantly slower rate - significant enough for me realise that he chose to 'take his time' and the second date never happened.

I'm not bothered by this as I wasn't super interested and generally speaking would not want to date someone who can't accept that I‚Äôm seeing a therapist, I am however wondering if this is a gender thing and applies to the majority of women/men. While I could've been more strategic in how I disclose this, it's not something I would want to omit if I find myself considering to see someone again or on a regular basis.",oystertartare,1,1690675255.0,1.0,1212,228,1212

"Is she's a gold digger? Hey, everyone! I (23M) had my very first date with this girl (21F). We met on a dating app and decided to meet the day after. BTW, I'm an introvert, and I was nervous and clueless as I didn't know how dates/meets work.

She asked me to meet her at the nearest metro station to her place at 5 pm. I almost reached on time, but there was a 40-50 minute wait until she arrived. We greeted each other, shook hands, and she started walking me towards a club.

We sat at a table, and she ordered some expensive drinks, such as French fries, a veggie dish, a glass of wine for herself, and a vodka shot for me. It was going well, but then she decided to have two more drinks, while I only had one more. She was a little flirty, asking if I could come over to her place after we finish here. She shared stories about how she lied to her mother to meet me, that she doesn't use Instagram because her brother said not to, and how she knows this place, etc... All her answers somewhat felt like a lie.

After some time, we asked for the bill, but she didn't even suggest that we should split it or something. I had to pay the expensive bill by myself. When we decided to leave, she made an excuse that her sister was going to pick her up, so I couldn't visit her place that day. While leaving the complex, we held hands and talked for a minute or two. She told me to WhatsApp her once I reach my place, so I did.

Now it's day two, and she hasn't even seen the message nor replied to it. I was curious and so checked her dating profile a few times last night to see if she's even online or asleep or something, but she was online, probably talking to other guys or finding new free drinks for herself, I don't know.

I didn't message her since she seems to be a gold digger, or am I wrong? Is this how typical dates go? I could use some advice here.",exist-without-name,1,1690673653.0,1.0,1862,369,1862

"Dealing with a summer romance Hi everyone, I'm feeling a bit down and would like to hear some opinions/advice from other people.

I got the opportunity to do an internship in Berkeley this summer and thought I'd find myself a summer fling. I was on the apps for maybe a month until this guy pops up and messages me. He's bi and exactly my type. We met up and I told him that this would just be a fling with no strings attached. We hit it off right away and got physical. I had never enjoyed sex before until him. The wonderful thing was that he stuck around, cuddled, kissed me and told me he enjoyed my company. I had never experienced it before and it struck something inside me. I think I started falling for him.

We spent time together almost everyday after that. I have a hard time opening up to men and being vulnerable. And when I've allowed someone so far in, it's hard to let them go. I talked with my friends and I was determined that I would just enjoy my time with him because this would be a great first experience overall. Fast forward to now, we just came back from a road trip we did to Monterey to go hiking in Big Sur. It was the happiest I've ever been in a while. We spent time again last night and he reminded me not to get attached and that I was only temporary Spoingus (a pet name he gave me). The word temporary hit a nerve and I felt sad. I asked him how he would feel when I'm gone and he told me that he'll be sad but he'll be fine. 

I was fully fine about the fate of whatever this was until he called me temporary like I was disposable. It just felt a bit demeaning. He's confused me so much. He acts and treats me the way people would in a relationship yet he tells me to feel differently. Why has he behaved like we were a couple this whole time (pet names, kissing, handholding in public, talking about family, etc)? If a fling was all he wanted, he could've just kept it physical. It's my fault for not setting boundaries and attaching more meaning to it.

Can someone help snap me out of this haze? I'm thinking of ending whatever this situationship is now.

Funny side note: This man fully told me he wanted to marry me and wished I was American (since we're both international students). We even went into a conversation picking out baby names and where we would settle down (decided on Vancouver).",DurianOverlord,1,1690672030.0,0.67,2337,447,2337

He told me that‚Äôs he‚Äôs about to open another location in Aventura and lately he‚Äôs been traveling for conferences across the US. 

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting. So far he seems really nice and we vibe. Only thing is the past week I‚Äôve gotten a text like once a day replying and or ‚ù§Ô∏è some of my text responses.

"I recently left a relationship, met someone new, and I don't feel happy? I never been in a relationship, so when I met her, I thought we were going to get married. I didn't realize that I'd be played with like a toy for 7 years of my life.  
  
For years my gf took advantage of my kindness, my trust, and anything she could find about me. She cheated all these years multiple times over and over and over again. Because I believed I loved her, I'd forgive her thinking she would change. She never changed.  
  
She would cry, say she didn't mean it, say it was a mistake, say she didn't know why she did what she did, and most importantly.. say she wouldn't know what to do with her life without me.. so I would forgive her.  
  
Then she would continue to cheat.  
  
Interestingly, none of these guys wanted to be with her at all. She would always come telling me that they cheated on her and that she is sorry for what she did to me. She knows she is not attractive so she keeps trying with new guys. I know they didn't like her because they always left her for other girls a week later. Most of the time, they would use her and ditch her.  
  
Having a soft spot in my heart for her, seeing her cry and admitting her mistakes, I'd always cave and forgive her. Like clockwork, she'd go back to cheating again, only to be dumped by these guys.  
  
Why did I stay with her? Was it love? Fear of being abandoned? She's all I've know for all these years, even though it was panful.. I don't know. Was it the crying?  
  
After leaving her and to my surprise, I found someone.  
  
Someone amazing, someone smart, someone kind, someone sweet, someone years younger than her. She not only head of heals over me for me, I think I might marry her, and we've only known each other for a month!  
  
I finally feel like I know what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. After 7 years of being cheated on, lied to, emotionally manipulated, having my feelings played with, I finally found someone.

"When and how it is acceptable to ask about your partner's previous relationships and sexual history? Probably a controversial topic, let me explain.  
  
I \[27M\] have a religius background, but I have not been religious at all since I was about 16, I would define myself as an atheist at the moment. Although I am no longer religious, my upbringing had a strong influence on my values. I have been only in 3 long time relationships and only had sex with these three girl. I did not participate in hookup culture at all, 0 one night stand, 0 fwb. Sex is something that for me involves a lot of emotions and I need to feel connecion and trust.  
  
As I hold and have lived by these views, I would look for the same in my future partner, but I don't know how and when to ask. Many people get offended if I ask anything about their past at the beginning, but I think it's something that should be discussed early enough so we don't waste each other time and don't hurt eachother.  
  
This is not about numbers. If she had 10 1 year long realationship and had sex with all 10 is perfectly fine for me, but if she had 2 one night stands or fwb it's a turn off for me.  
  
I honestly don't want to judge anyone. It's perfectly fine if someone has different views on this. I know many people will probably disagree with me, but these are my preferences, and I need advice on when and how to bring this up without offending others and to find out if we share the same views.

"How do you know if someone is dating you for superficial reasons I broke up with my boyfriend because of some red flags at the time . I misinterpreted some things that he said , actually I don‚Äôt really know now and am having second thoughts. He seems to say things sometimes without thinking first . In my experience people usually tell you who they are if you listen enough however . One time he said ‚Äúmaybe women shouldn‚Äôt work because of their periods‚Äù and another time he said that ‚Äúsome people think that women shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to vote‚Äù. After talking to him about these things that he said and how they came off as extreme and misogynistic statements in 2023, he explained that he thinks that we still aren‚Äôt able to talk about how periods affect women and that women should be able to take time off work if their periods really affect them enough. He also clarified and said that there are some people who think that women should not have been given the right to vote because women are considered underprivileged still in our society they can be easily manipulated by political candidates even if the candidate isn‚Äôt a good candidate and isn‚Äôt going to help our country in general they will say they will help women‚Äôs rights and women will buy into it. He said that isn‚Äôt his belief that women shouldn‚Äôt have been given the right but that he understands where people who say this are coming from and doesn‚Äôt know what the answer is for women or minorities who are easily manipulated by these political candidates. So all of that makes sense and is a discussion that makes sense but the original statement he makes comes off as extreme right? 

I have given this guy the benefit of the doubt because I think we all can say extreme things and not exactly mean it. He told me I have said extreme things about men too or other topics and he doesn‚Äôt hold it against me. He cited that I at one point made a statement and said that I had said that a lot of men are sexual perforators . I think we were watching chris Hanson lol. I responded that might come off as extreme and can see how people would be put off by my statement but that statistics show that a lot of sexual assaults are under reported and even the statistics that are reported are high with 1 in 4 women being sexually assaulted in her life . In my own experience using dating apps and dating in general I have been sexually harassed or groped approximately 20 times in my life so I was also making this statement based on my experience. I don‚Äôt think that this statement comes off as hating all men or anything like that. I also don‚Äôt think it is comparable to his statements as I feel like in this time most men are a little more careful about saying such extreme statements since the difference is that women can fear men and men don‚Äôt experience that with women . I feel like he‚Äôs trying to flip the script to avoid accountability ?

Most recently after trying to be understanding of my boyfriends statements and getting back together he told me that he felt he needed to reach out to me again and get back together with me because I am the most beautiful woman he‚Äôs ever dated. I was really offended at this particular statement because all of my life I have experienced men lying about themselves, misrepresenting themselves , and lying about their intentions in order to date me because they think I‚Äôm attractive . I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want to be considered attractive but it is also a double edged sword in dating just like I‚Äôm sure rich guys have that double edged sword too. I said how this really offended me and my boyfriend apologized and said he says stupid things sometimes and how he obviously likes other things about me and then cited him stating these other things this way which can sound harsh . He does constantly compliment me on other things like my cooking skills, how we have amazing conversations, how he‚Äôs never met anyone like me that thinks the way I do and how we can talk about all kinds of topics , how I am really sweet, how I am health focused, and how smart I am . 

But this statement bothered me I guess because of my experiences of men lying and even making me think they really like me only to find out they like me primarily because they find me attractive and that is their main priority .

"Some books that might help with dating Some books that might help with dating

Hey Folks! I have been on a journey of self growth this year and wanted to share a couple of self-help books that have really helped me understand people, relationships and dating better. I thought they might help some of you as well so I‚Äôll share:

"Self-Growth in Partners and High Expectations I (24m) have been a pretty active dater in my life. I‚Äôve always had relationships on and off, some more or less serious. Lately I have been having a big issue though where every person I date, seems to not want to better themself. I am big on always wanting to improve: I work out and want to do more, I‚Äôm eating healthy and want to be more consistent, I work a lot and try to move up in my career and I‚Äôm always working on self-education. I find myself ending relationships because the people I‚Äôm dating don‚Äôt want or work towards any of these things for themself in a way that I see. I tend to start most of my relationships from online dating like tinder or just social media dm‚Äôs. Every serious relationship I have gets to a point where my partner sees us getting married and is head over heels for me, then I realize I don‚Äôt see myself marrying them and so I break up with them for that reason and they see it as a complete blindside and end up very hurt and heartbroken. We almost always keep good relationships after and remain friends or even continue to hookup. Where am I going wrong and do I just have crazy expectations? 
Maybe I just need to find places to meet women irl from the start instead of starting on tinder?",vccomplice,1,1690821273.0,1.0,1276,241,1276
"Did I mess it up by being too aggro? Hey, see below for backstory. 

Did I mess it up? For date 4, I asked if she wanted to grab dinner and then come over to chill. She has left me on read. Did the ""come over"" part ruin the vibes?

Prior to this message, she told me that she was free Wed and Fri, so I went with Friday. 

I was planning to follow back up on Wednesday with a place for dinner, thoughts on this next step? General advice on the approach here?

I've been on 3 dates with this lady, and each one has gone well. Good rapport and I can feel the mutual physical attraction and interest in the air. We have kissed at the end of each date.

"Fell for someone and it ended out of nowhere I met someone and we spent 2 mos together - he took me camping with all his close friends, introduced me to his daughter, and would spend every single night during the week at my house for these 2 mos. He told me he really liked me and he met my parents and celebrated my birthday with me. He said he wanted to take things slow, but he was the one who wanted to spend every night together and bring his kid to meet me a few times, and would even leave his dog at my house. I did tell him about a month into it that we should slow down a bit on the time together or else I would get attached but it was going so well so I took his drive to spend time together as a good sign. 

I was having a rough week last week and told him I wasn‚Äôt doing so well and needed some support and he pulled away and ended it the next day, stating he was ‚Äútoo tired with his job‚Äù and unable to treat me how I deserved. I did try to talk it out and say we could make it work with boundaries and not spending every night together but he ultimately said he made up his mind and left. 

I have started no contact and logically know it is for the better and it wasn‚Äôt that long of a connection but I feel like I‚Äôm having a hard time because it was going so well and I got so used to spending every single night with him and maybe fell for the potential I saw. Does anyone have any pointers to help move past this person? I just keep thinking of all the good stuff and hoping he realizes what he is losing and comes back.

*I just want to note that I have dated people with kids and I never once pressured him or wanted to take time away from him as a father.

"Porn Addiction pushed me to cheat on my GF. I am a degenarate (M22) I am a 22 year old man. I have a beautif caring girlfriend which thinks the world of me. She loves me and I love her too. Currently she is overseas studying and I am working back in my home country of Australia. 

I never wanted to admit it but i am an addict. A porn addict. I search up new more crazy shit to hit a new high. That being said. It doesn't take anything away from the intimacy of me and my girlfriend. I still enjoy those things with her immensely. But at times. I will gaslight myself into thinking my porn viewing is just me doing things when she is not in the mood. Or me doing things when i just want something far fetched that i don't wish to rope her in.

This passed 3 months. I have fucked up beyond imagination. It all began when i watch asian massage parlour pornos with happy endings. I got this bad urge. I know a few of these establishments near my town. I went to them.

The first time i did it. I felt like absolute dogshit afterwards. Regretted it and sworn to never repeat it. Then 3 weeks later i went to another. Again felt like shit. I told myself to always jerk off before doing it to hit myself with postnut clarity. Last month i went to another and i found myself getting a happy ending once more.

I sat in the car afterwards. Staring at the steering wheel. Thinking to myself. What the actual fuck is wrong with me. I sworn to myself that if i love my girlfriend. I would end it here. And just die with this secret.

I never told her because i don't want to lose her over a fucking shit move i did. I know its selfish but fuck. I really fucking love her and it will ruin her if she knows.

Last night i went to a Porno Cinema by myself. I saw a few men there. I sat in the back and began to jerk my dick. A transgender women came up to me and jerked my cock for me. I froze up and i tried to push them away but ultimately I just let it happened....

I came. It felt good for 10 seconds until it dawn what the flying fuck I just did. I am a straight man.

Good lord I need help. I don't plan to tell my gf any of this. I can't lose her. She means everything to me. I am detemined to change and put this all behind me. So from now on I can just be normal again.

"Went on a terrible date So I went on a date with this girl yesterday, we were talking for the past two weeks and everything was going great. Right into the date we were talking and I asked her about her internship and how she gets to college like if she drives or anything. She said she got a DUI one year ago and that kind of was a turn off for me but I believing seconds chances. I look up her mugshot and she got arrested for poss of controlled substance and DUI. Back to the date we decide to go bowling to just do a fun activity which was cool and all but it was really hot in there and I wanted to leave after 30 minutes so we decide to go get dinner, after that she asked me if I can drive her home because she forgot her charger and ID and the she texts me go down the street hurry right now so I‚Äôm like what the hell, I look in my mirror and her mom is chasing after her and stops in front of my car and I hit the brakes and she says are you seeing her I said yeah we are just going out to dinner she then read my license plate out loud to me and said she was going to call the cops and that her daughter has a active case but nothing happened with the police or anything. At the dinner date she is barely talking and is just looking at random things as I‚Äôm talking to her and she just starts laughing, turns out the date turned out to be $130 because of a stupid $30 service charge which is whatever. During the date she did not ask me one question about myself at all and seemed like she was in and out of reality on what was happening that she was on a date with someone  I am considering giving it one more shot but I am not sure. We also got yogurt after which was $15 and she did not pay for that At all. I just think the dui is a huge red flag.

"(32m) Last 4 women have each ended it with me after at least one date with some variant of ""can't be in a relationship right now"". What am I doing wrong? I've been looking for a long term relationship, but I keep finding myself in this situation where the woman says she's realized she's not looking for that.

Please tell me what I'm missing or doing wrong, what I need to fix because while they have all been very polite and thoughtful in ending it and I'm surprised and grateful they haven't ghosted me because it seems so common online. The theme of them expressing a disinterest in pursuing a serious relationship is making me wonder: **what the hell it is I'm doing wrong so consistently?** (and why is it so obvious to four different women, but not myself).

It's been after after a date with no kissing, after going to bed together on the second date, after going to bed multiple times - all different. So it's not like ""they just used you for sex"". There's no pattern, it's not like there's a behaviour or action that I've done that I can point to that makes it clear - ""ahh it's when I said this obviously egregious thing"". They all had different professions, different ages. Some there were hours of phone calls before the first date, others it was just messaging then date.

Here's the kicker though: I met all of them on Hinge, the dating app that markets itself for something more serious. How's that for irony?

The only possible common denominator left is **me** : but they have all been at pains to soften the blow with the classic ""it's not you it's me"". But 4 times in a row? Come on. Twice is a coincidence. Four times is a failure on my part.

I am honestly clueless as to what personality flaw or behaviour I'm exhibiting that is at the root of this.

In the interest of producing context but at risk of flattering myself, the only possible explanation I can fathom is these women were on dating apps without the intention of actual commitment in the first place? I base this on the fact that one of these women literally said to me in what sounds just too flattering to be true that she was ready to delete Hinge because her career was taking up too much of her time and she didn't want anyone in her life, but then I managed to grab her attention and she (with some goading from her friends) decided to see if she could make it work. But... obviously, she couldn't. If that's true I interpret that to mean I'm quite simply looking in the wrong places, which begs the question of: okay, where are the right places?

The bottom line is I'm trying to look at this as an opportunity to improve and develop further as a person. Of course I have flaws, but I don't know what is the root cause here, and therefore I'm unable to take meaningful steps to fix it - despite being eager to do so.

"It's only toxic if you treat people like shit. If you date someone who is a type of person you say sou won't date becasuse someone told you it was ""toxic"" not to and you are miserable about it adnd you treat that person like shit then that's toxic. If you didn't date those people that YOU know YOU don't want and treat the people that you want great then that's non toxic. 

You might not agree about someone's age preferences, single-mom exclusion, race exclusion, size exclusion, etc., however sexual and romantic attraction is irrational. There is literally no logical foundation in human attraction, which is a good thing. But just declaring it as ""toxic"" ""hate"" or predatory is just irresponsible, after all people's lives have been ruined by people just throwing those terms around.

If I said I don't  wan to date a single mom, and have sex with a woman who has given birth to a baby especially since I don't want my firs tome to be wiht a single mom, it would only be toxic if I DATED a single mom and would refuse sex and treated her like garbage.

If I had gotten a girl pregnant and she said that she wanted to keep the baby despite my reasons and said that I would not have to pay child support and I wasn't on the birth record, and I stayed with her, refused sex and treated her like garbage over it then THAT would be toxic. 

If I dated a girl who was overweight but refused to sleep with her and called her all kinds of names instead of simply not dating her or try to help her become healthy then THAT would be TOXIC.

If I dated a girl from a race or was bi-racial with a race I don't want to date and I called her derogatory names and cheated on her with ""white"" women than that would be toxic. And make me a cheating asshole. 

If I dated a18 year old at 34(age at the time of this writing) or 37 (the other person, I am going to talk about) So what? That does not make one a ""Predator"" or a pervert or whatever. 

There was this woman who was 37 and she was married to a woman who was 18 who did something that she found highly offensive, none of my business what it was but the people in the thread were just bombarding this poor woman with predator accusations based on the age gap alone without even knowing the relationship dynamic. Calling an adult, a predator for dating a younger adult based on age alone is evil full stop. Now if she was trolling around for 18-year-olds to date just because she perceived them as ""easy"" then that would be predatory. That's the definition of a predator. 

I said earlier that since I have never had a girlfriend, I'd like to date someone who is younger and would be objectively more attractive and I threw in the 18-22 range and I got the most insane comments, despite the fact I am not looking for them for any type of easy factor, I have just observed that those ages have the most physically attractive girls. These are legal adults. People vary in maturity at all ages but you would have to actually get to know them in order to see where they are at. 

Apparently it might not make for a ""Lasting relationship"" but why would a 34-year-old who has never dated and does not have a ""career"" or got to sow his oats want to set himself up for a 6-10 or even lifetime relationship the first time around, that's too much too fast and online (Tinder) I expanded my maximum age to 29. 

Those ages 18-29 have the least single moms, the least ""Jaded"" and the least emotional baggage. and most of the girls I have swiped yes to have been white women in the 22-26 years old range. People Panic about age alone without even considering it's the mentality of the people involved that determines whether it is predatory or not. 

If I found a girl who was 18 or even 17 by happenstance and we just liked and respected each other and set up appropriate boundaries and communicated, and decided to wait to do the deed clearly than there's no problem.

Hell to some wanting to have had more than 1 GF before you turn 40 is toxic too, it would only be if i lied to the girl and broke up with her making an excuse instead of being honest that we are not going to be super long term.

Not wanting to be married or have children is also not toxic, regardless of religion.

Never wanting to date your own race is not toxic if you simple are just not physically and emotionally attracted to your race. I simply am just not sexually attracted to black women, I don't harbor any hate and I don't treat them any different than anyone else, and even if I was into all races 99% of the people with the same interests and hobbies and beliefs as me have been white or other anyway and therefore would be on my radar to date.

Plus dating from a closer net type of community is just TOO familiar, and too the same, Its basically like a black version of Shiva baby to me in my community, it's normal to exclusively attracted to opposites, you learn more about the world that way. 

I love girls from Slavic countries with their lilting accents soft round faces and their down to earth despite being drop dead gorgeous demeanor. Apparently, that's toxic too.

"She's 17 she want to date but i'm 21, need advice please Because it's a delicate subject I will reassure by saying in advance that nothing but absolutely nothing carnal or physical has ever happened between her and me, often she flirts with me but it's completely manageable

No silly texting, no sexting, just once in a while she tells me that she care about me and that she would like to try a serious relationship

I don't respond to her flirts either, at best I tease her or joke about it but nothing more

I'm not an expert in the law but the fact that she has a crush on me can bring me legal problems or not? What if I decide to go out with her but it doesn't get sexual until she's of age is that ok?",Jaune666,1,1690763489.0,0.53,708,140,708
"Should I apologies even though I did nothing wrong ? So I‚Äôve recently gotten myself into trouble with this girl I work with. She‚Äôs pretty new only been work there a few weeks and I thought she was pretty cute things is she‚Äôs kinda young 18 to be exact snd I‚Äôm 24. I personally don‚Äôt see that to be a big deal and truth be told not sure if that‚Äôs the main source of the issue but that‚Äôs my best guess as to why things are the way they are en. So I had a few shifts where it was mostly just me her and our manager I decided to try and get to no her a bit we seemed to hit it off and I personally thought she liked me tbh or maybe not liked me but might have had some interest  but i mis read her clearly. Anyway I got her snap shot her a few texts but I didn‚Äôt shoot my shot at all up to this point I was still trying to feel things out so that I wouldn‚Äôt end up in a situation just like im in now. Anyway I ended up sending her something along the lines of the following ‚Äú yea we really didn‚Äôt get to talk much at work especially since it got so busy.do you live in the area ?‚Äù I had actually said the name of my home town which I just changed to in the area for obvious reasons. Anyway she took that ad me implying or asking her out which I wasn‚Äôt actually trying to do or imply and I quickly told her that after she just swiftly rejected me for sending her that. So I got rejects without even shooting my shot üò≠ that‚Äôs fine tho but since then she‚Äôs made things very awkward at work. She won‚Äôt talk to me or ask me to help even if I‚Äôm standing right next to her and I work with her every Wednesday and sometimes it‚Äôs just me and her. Should I try talking with her the next time I see her and apologize even though I really didn‚Äôt do anything wrong or just try to ignore her. I should also mention that she‚Äôs going around telling some other coworkers that I did ask her to hang out quote on quote , which is something I don‚Äôt appreciate since that was a private conversation. Plus the way she words to me makes it seem oddly sexual  she never says that I asked her out  or wanted to date she always say that I wanted her to come hang out. So how should I handle this ?

I know sounds crazy but it got Intesne i never connected like that and he said that same....i felt like he was a mirror version of me. We talked about everything deep and dark and fun things to plans for the future and he keep saying he wanted to marry me I was perfect. I guesse I didnt kmow him so well but I would say our connection was equalvlant to one month of dating just to put things in perspective. Which is still know is not crazy serious but I think I started to fall for him not in love but started.

I've got over it alot but bits of me still miss him I need to fully let it go I need advice plz. 

So its kinda a crazy siatiatuon I just ended my previous situationship 2 days prior after being sexual assaulted and abused......i said I'd never have unprotected sex unless married but he did it while i was not sober. I was then dealing with fear of pregnancy and stds idk why i went back to tinder to distract my mind I guesse but we connected so intensely after a week I had to tell him it wasnt the right time I have to get tested for anything after being assaulted by this person I've only known a month so not that well.

"I think it's a red flag when a woman doesn't have male friends None of the Flairs matched what I'm trying to say, this is just an opinion.

I know the prevailing theory is often people being jealous and people saying they don't want partners with friends of the opposite sex, but I think it's a little weird when women don't have any male friends. Obviously there are exceptions to everything, and sometimes it may not necessarily just be that she doesnt want to have any male friends, but I think for most people having friends of the opposite sex is healthy and promotes growth and gives you insight from outside of your worldview. 

Personlly, I'd be more turned off by a woman who has no male friends than a woman who has some (not that either would turn me off)

I told her that I enjoyed our time together but if she didn‚Äôt that I would understand, I also asked her how she sees this as I was confused.

"21 year old male seeking for advice, because he messed it up Hi people, recently I moved into a dorm. I had a girlfriend as well, but we recently broke up (not everyone knows this).   
From day 1 I fancied a girl, not because she was that good -looking, but something was just right about her appearance.  I did not have a chat with her. Last week we went out (she was not there) but I was with a few of her best friends and told them (while drunk) that I wanted to ask her out to the ball and that I found her cute. Her friends were really positive about this idea and said she would 99% surely would say yes.   
The next day a (girl)friend of her told her that she was not keen on it (the girlfriend is a bit into me and jealous) and her guy  friend did not really talk about it but hit on me (I am straight). She definetly knows that I am into her, and I would even say that the people I have told this about told me that I was above her league. Now I don't really know what to do because I 100% sure know that she knows, but I feel a very awkward vibe and we haven't even spoken yet, there is some overlap between our friend groups and sometimes we hang out together as a group.

"Bad matched want to date me and seemingly good ones don‚Äôt feel a spark Honestly looking for support or advice.

I don‚Äôt have luck meeting people IRL because I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm intimidating to approach. The guys I find interesting are often engrossed in work, with friends, or are in a relationship so I don‚Äôt approach them. I‚Äôm quite friendly and find it very easy to make small talk with women and folks a little older than me (I‚Äôm late 20s). I make small talk with men but they‚Äôre not as responsive to that.

It‚Äôs been 4 years since my last relationship ended and since then I‚Äôve found myself in the above situations or situationships with men who have serious commitment issues.

During the day he always message and we always text , yesterday we had very nice sex after one month from not seeing each other and he mentioned how he really enjoyed it and before that he mentioned he will take me to  gala dinner related to his work.

 I feel insecure about this 
 I read that sometimes  instgram online statue is not accurate and I does not show I'd the person is really online....but I don't know....I don't want to communicate about this because I feel I don't have the right to question this 

I am insecure sometimes so I don't want this to impact us .
I have anxious attachment so I feel insecure lots of time but I don't want to communicate this thing ....i feel talking about this can make relationship complicated and me to look like crazy girlfriend

"Was it my fault? So I (F21) matched with this guy (M23) on Tinder about a year or so ago. But it turns out that we actually went to high school together, which I thought was cool. Nothing really came out of us dating, and he‚Äôs not a bad looking guy at all. Fairly attractive, a friendly sense of humor. But we talked about the thought of dating but decided being friends would be for the better. We became good friends and text here and there and that‚Äôs it. No more, no less.

However I recently got on Bumble, saw his profile and texted him saying ‚ÄúI just saw you on Bumble‚Äù then he goes ‚ÄúReally? I‚Äôm assuming you have an account or something?‚Äù I told him that I recently joined a couple of days ago and thought it was funny that he was on there. He said ‚ÄúHow come I didn‚Äôt see you on there then?‚Äù Me and him usually have a playful tone in texting, so I said ‚ÄúWell my account is still pretty new. But also because good things are hard to come by! Lol.‚Äù I was just playing around, because that‚Äôs how we always normally text. I didn‚Äôt mean for it to sound sexual. Next thing you know, he texted me a full nude photo of himself and said ‚ÄúWould *this* be hard to come by?‚Äù It was a mirror selfie, his hand was on his dick and everything. He was hard.

Man, I‚Äôm really upset right now. Like, my chest is hurting and I‚Äôm extremely uncomfortable. Why did this happen? I didn‚Äôt want him to send a nude. Was it something I said? Did the tone of my text come off as sexual or something? I wasn‚Äôt intending for it to be that way but now I‚Äôm super upset and don‚Äôt know what to do. I thought he was a friend I could trust, and for some stupid reason, I let that get the best of me. I haven‚Äôt answered because I‚Äôm in shock. Am I overreacting? What should I do? Should I say something, or just not reply at all, or block him? Because this just killed my mood real bad :/",No-Tie-4872,1,1690815546.0,1.0,1856,368,1856

Why tell me you‚Äôre not interested in playing any games and wasting any time, yet that‚Äôs exactly what you begin to do?

"Not Sure If I want To Date Anymore Most of the women I have matched with only ask me if I wanna hookup with them. It's gotten annoying and just kinda sad. Like I'm more than just a one night stand.

It also doesn't help that I've been cheated on and gaslighted multiple times and because of that I've developed some serious trust issues. I've been trying to get past that but it's always hanging around in the back of my head.

As far as the girls I meet in real life they see me as some dude and never really try to have a relationship with me.

"Problems of dating So I will talk about the dating life of the current generation and problems of it.
As I know from various  studies young men are having less sex with every year. By some statistics I came to the conclusion that it happens because some small percent of guys are getting the attention of all girls and all the other guys are getting nearly nothing. That top guys who get all the girls get overwhelmed by the amount of options they have and instead of getting a nice long term relationships they start just having one night stands with those girls or having some short term relationships with them just for sex. It results in girls saying that ""all guys are the same"" and ""all they want is sex"", but in reality all the other guys who just want a good healthy relationship can't get it and start hating on girls because of it. Also lots of guys get desperate and start ""simping"" for attractive girls or lower their standards to get at least something. That results in girls ego increasing even more and them only paying attention to top attractive guys which leads us to the start of conversation and gives us the full circle.

"How to get over a past f-up? \*Throwaway account

I recently reached 30 (male, btw), and up until now I have never been in a serious relationship. There were a few casual dates here and there, but nothing too serious. I also was really focused on my studies (10 years to get an undergrad, but that's a story for another time), and dating always has been an afterthought for me. Also, no ""this is the one"" moment for any of the women I've met.

On top of all that, I had a big f-up that no one knows about; I got scammed into masturbating in front of a camera in front of a girl I met online, then whoever was behind the camera began to blackmail me. Thankfully I mamaged to bring everything under control within a few hours, without no one really seeing my dick pick.

I feel so ashamed, humiliated, and angry over what has happened. It has also definitely made me less trustful of others. As in, I can't trust anyone to open myself up, as well as not trusting myself to being honest to what has happened to anyone unfortunate enough to date me.

So as the title says, how do I get over a past f-up, and learn to trust myself and others? There's this girl (29f) that I've met at volunteering and I find her to be an amazing person, and I am crushing on her pretty hard. I of course try not to be too obvious or look like a creep about it.

I feel I can get the courage to ask her out (remember, no serious relationship before so I am sloppy at this), but my past fuck-up seems to be holding me back",MiddlePop,1,1690775205.0,1.0,1498,292,1498

After talking for a couple of days we decided to spend a night together on a hotel. So we went in we got some food and watched a movie. After that we started kissing and we had sex. The thing is i would say it was the worst one so far. He was so promising from the texts but nothing of what he was saying happened . After that I stayed for a bit trying to find an excuse to go and then i came up with the idea i said to him ill go to the shop to grab some snacks . And so i did i left and never went back .

The combination of the two results in my face being red almost every day.

"So how much of a dealbreaker are older self harm scars from the past? So I have some scars that are pretty obvious on clothed parts of my body. My upper arm near my shoulder and on both thighs. So you can't see them normally, but someone I'd be intimate with would definitely notice them.

They're from 2021, during a period of extreme depression stemming from childhood trauma. But in the 2 years since, that has improved dramatically. Now I pass as a normal, well-adjusted person with some quirks. You wouldn't think I'd be at a point that low in my past. I still have minor depression, with the rare major depressive episode. But those are continually improving.

However, I feel like anyone who sees my scars will immediately be repulsed, and won't give me the benefit of the doubt that I'm better, and have greatly improved. They'll see it as a sign of a major personality flaw or psychiatric disorder that will always be with me.

This coupled with how I have no sexual and romantic experience makes me think I'm undateable (yeah, that's a real word...).

"I always start to panic when things are starting to become more serious or feelings get involved I am (28F), never had a solid relationship besides a very confusing situationship for 1,5 years give or take and a 2,5 month thing in which we were exclusive (i eventually found out he was on tinder, so maybe not). I was very late to the dating game, so sometimes I feel like I am a newbie to this. Besides that I have had a hard time expressing feelings and letting people come close to me both physically and emotionally. However, I have been in therapy for about 8 years and I have changed so much. I am very happy with where I am now, but when it comes to dating a lot of my insecurities which i have worked hard on still kind of creep back in. 

I just met a guy during a holiday which i felt a connection with and he asked me out after. I mean I want to trust my gut that he likes me because he gives of those vibes. But in the past a lot of times I thought guys liked me and eventually just dropped me (hence the situationship). This makes me even more careful then before and i am sooo scared to like someone and get hurt again. But at the same time I just want to be able to open up my heart and let someone in. 

I started freaking out again, thinking I might have read his signals wrong and he doesn't see me that way at all. While when I am with him I feel like he likes me. But now being home and having time to think, I am freaking out again... I just wish I could just stay calm and see what happens. But part of me doesn't even want to try again and get heartbroken all over... 

I do think we have a good vibe, but now that we might become something more than just friends. It feels like I don't know how to act anymore. I feel like I have a hard time being myself and I am stressing out about doing something wrong... 

How do you just stay yourself and not let your head get in the way. I just want to experience whatever this is. Not overthink it to the point that I am so filled with fear that I freeze up or freak out.

"39M Dating Profile Advice I am a 39-year old man looking to potentially start dating after my partner died 11 years ago. I am a tall (6'3""), fat (currently 300 lbs; am down 30 lbs and continuing to lose), bipolar (medicated), introverted, highly functioning autistic single father of a 16-year old trans girl. That is an enormous amount of baggage packed into one sentence, but I am also highly educated (masters degree), generally successful (6-figure salary, own my own home), and have been told I am friendly and caring, though I tend to overthink things.

With all of that being said, since I had met my partner at work many years ago by happenstance, I don't exactly know how to go about it. I figure Online Dating is a good place to start, which brings me to my real question:

If I am interested in dating, open to serious or casual relationships depending on the connection, how much baggage should I put in a profile? Height and weight are kind of no-brainers, as is my child (she is my first priority, but at 16 she doesn't really need a new mom) of course, but I am kind of torn on the rest. My bipolar disorder is under control with medication and I am very open when talking to people to let them know (when it might matter, coworkers, bosses, etc.) but there is the very real stigma surrounding it, and I don't want to blindside anyone. My autism could probably go without mentioning since I learned about it recently, but now that I know I also feel it would be wrong to not tell someone that might be interested in getting serious with me (maybe this would be a thing to leave out of a profile but bring up after a few dates?).

I guess I am looking for advice on balancing sufficient, honest disclosure vs. oversharing. ",Particular-Crab335,1,1690749706.0,1.0,1737,317,1737
"Having trouble maintaining my relationship Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year now. We loved each other but recently we‚Äôre having some problems at a tiring rate.

Things started to get difficult after I moved back with my mom after an unexpected chance of living together with my girlfriend for about 2 months, and my girl friend didn‚Äôt cope with my absence very well. She told me that she felt very down and cried a lot because she missed me. I comforted her that I missed her too and now it‚Äôs just a phase before we can officially live together.
After the first week she came up with the idea of getting a dog, I think that getting a dog might make her feel less lonely so I agree with her and we did went to get the dog together.

The first week after getting the dog, things does not seem to turn out well. She told me that this is a mistake and she couldn‚Äôt take care of the dog like she thought she can. I said to her that it‚Äôs normal for people to have cold feet after taking in a pet and I myself did feel the same way when I got my dog. And that she should take a try for the first month and if things does not get better we will find another foster home for the dog. Another week went by and everything seem to be brighter. She started getting used to taking care of the dog and she does not feel too down like when I moved out.

But then, the dog had scab. The scab has been before we took her in. My girl friend had spent a lot of money treating the dog condition. Now to think I was so stupid not telling her to contact the people that sold the dog to us, because we did contact them and they said they will cover the expense for us but we‚Äôve already paid for another facility. Currently the treatment does seem to work but too slow. Back when things got better, we had plan on taking some time for ourselves, but with the treatment got longer than expected, i‚Äôve told her she and I should wait in case of the larger expense. We had a fight, she said to me that she felt helpless that she cannot afford to do anything on her own without thinking to much like before she got the dog. I said that it‚Äôs normal that it does take a lot of money when someone first take care of a pet, not too mention that it is sick. She replied that she did understand but she just couldn‚Äôt wrap her head around the fact that now she cannot treat herself like before. Eventually she partly accepted the situation.

For my part, now with this continuous chain of poor choice, unlucky events and my many attempts to cheer her up just for things to drag her down even further depressed, I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do next because it broke my heart to see her like this and I don‚Äôt seem to help her feel better at all. And it also affected my life as I‚Äôm writing this at 3 in the morning because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my relationship. I would be really appreciated if you guys could help me with some advice.

"Is it a good idea to break No Contact? (F20 &amp; M21) I want him back. We were a great couple, the reason we broke up was because of distance. (We were long distance, he broke up with me)
 He even admitted that he believes ‚Äúin true love‚Äù that ‚Äúif one day, weeks, months or years later we meet again at a better time‚Äù then we could try again. 

We didn‚Äôt talk for a week, until I texted him about a serious situation (I found out I was pregnant after the break up, and lost the baby the following week). The situation was the only reason we were in contact for two weeks, he was very supportive and inclusive despite not wanting the baby because of our financial standings and that fact that we weren‚Äôt together anymore.

"Starting a relationship with my best friend, need advice Context - My best friend and I have known each other for a year but she just admitted that she has feelings for me.

"Advice on recent dating situation - uncertain about interest Hi everyone, I could use some advice on a dating situation that has me feeling a bit confused. I've been seeing this guy for almost a month now, and things seemed to be going well. We've been texting every day and meeting up every weekend. 

Last weekend, we had a fun double date with some friends, and everything seemed great. However, on Sunday, things got a bit weird.

He seemed a bit distant when I arrived on Saturday, but he blamed it on being tired from a late night out. The double date went well, or so I thought, but on Sunday, he suddenly had to meet a friend for a last-minute thing. He mentioned he thought he told me about it the night before, but I don't recall that conversation. After spending the night together, he texted me later in the day, and our texts have become quite cold. 

I'm torn between ignoring his last message to save face as he has suddenly gone cold and risk looking too keen if I bring up my concerns. I feel like he should know why I'm a bit bothered and notice my change in texts. What would you guys do in this situation?",Difficult_Sherbet948,1,1690832816.0,1.0,1125,211,1125

"We just had our 3rd date and I still feel confused as to whether she even likes me-- what do I do? I (F25) have been dating a woman (F25) for 3 weeks. We've been out with each other once each week. Our actual dates are pretty fun and I like her. The problem is that I'm not sure if she feels the same way at all. 

The main reasons are as follows: 

1. Her texting response times are glacial. Always within the day, but many hours later. If it were up to me, we'd be chatting a lot more, and that's even with the fact that I normally hate texting. I want to talk to her, and get to know her. Part of me wonders: am I just getting too attached too quickly, maybe these response times are normal? 

2.  I've been driving everything. I've planned and paid for all of our dates, which I'm delighted to do-- but combined with the first point, it overall feels like she wouldn't even notice if I just dropped off the face of the planet. She showed a bit of initiative by asking if I wanted to go to a museum with her this weekend, but she had a change of plans and we didn't go. 

3. She's been a bit more physically distant than I would like-- like we haven't even kissed yet and I haven't bothered asking because I feel like she wouldn't be comfortable with it. I feel like you should only ask to kiss if you're really feeling that mutual ""energy"" in the air-- but I'm just not getting that from her. She said she wants to go slow, and I totally understand and even prefer it. ""Going slow"" is a green flag to me. But in light of the above two points, it just feels like I'm getting strung along a bit. To be clear, I would never pressure her or even ask her to do anything physical. I'm waiting on her and I'd be happy to wait as long as she likes. I'm just listing this as a point because I feel that I'm overall getting no positive indication from her that she's into me. 

It just confuses me that she still seems to enjoy our dates (and agrees to more), even though she seems to show minimal interest in me outside of them. It's made me dislike her, honestly. So as a result, I've come to the conclusion that I should cease planning any further dates and stop trying to text her. (Although, being the drunk idiot that I was on our last date on Friday, I invited her to take my second ticket to an expensive upcoming concert ü§¶). My thinking is that if she basically doesn't take any initiative whatsoever within the next week, I'll take that as a rejection and move on. She could:

1. Initiate a text conversation with me.

2. Ask me out on a date.

3. y'know üëâüëà 

And if she does any of the above, it might not really mean that it'll work out, but I'll at least not call it quits completely by next Sunday. But I don't know if this is the right course of action or what. Please help ü•∫",PathalogicalObject,1,1690741484.0,1.0,2784,545,2784

"[Loneliness] Being unmarried or single for whole life Hey Folks, I will be turning 30 next year. Currently single and not planning to fall in love / get married. 

I have been into 3 long relationships - spanning more than 3 years each of them. 

For most of the life aspects it is normal, I don't feel any issue being single. I have a pretty busy schedule - job, workout, sleep, hobbies once in a while. I don't find issue in making myself busy. I enjoy myself.

The only thing that causes an itch in my heart is the feeling of loneliness. I feel there are lots of things you can not share with friends or close family members. There is a sense of completeness you get from another human only, someone you know who is always there, someone you can call and chat for any long, someone who you can spend as much time as possible. Someone you know is for you and will stay yours for years and years.

We spent the whole weekend together and I think he seems really nice but there is just a few things that I'm unsure on and idk if I'm being shallow or not cause the guys I've dated in the past were very strong believers in paying for literally everything! This dude has asked me to split the bill with him when he was ordering a pizza and I can't eat anything like that due to a health condition, now I'm not afraid to pay for things I'm a believer in 50/50 payment as long as its something I can also eat lol

He can't cook either.
I know this sounds terrible but his hairline is probs the worst hairline I've ever seen in my life, however, he does cover it with his hair and he's kinda cute anyway.

I'm not trying to come across as shallow here and it will probs sound like I am but I mainly care about personality however, the spark that you immediately get isn't really there for me like it has been with past dating experiences.

So should I just cut it off now or should I wait it out and see him a few more times to see if he is a nice person and also because IMO looks aren't everything even though yes he's good looking but I don't know I like me a man who is a lil rough around the edges and this guy seems suuuper nice, he's super calm and relaxed which I probably need in my life right now but I can't help but miss the way my ex was now I'm dating again.

Also he isn't good at messaging and I'm a mega messager so I'm not even sure hes proper interested although he has arranged to see me the last 3 times so I'm unsure.

But she has a coworker male best friend - that in all honesty, he‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs awesome. Based on our few interactions, he‚Äôs a genuine guy. And I‚Äôm jealous of him.

She has not given me any reason to doubt her and I know this is a me issue that I need to work on.

I asked her why they never sought each other romantically. She said it‚Äôs because they practically grew up together and sees him as a brother. Totally valid and rational.

"Trying to see where things go again for the 4th time in almost 2 years (20M,21F) Before I get into the meat And potatoes of this connection, let me give some context. For one, he is in the military, the army, to be exact. We started talkin briefly after I had to put my dog down. When we met, he was separating from his now ex-wife. There is a child involved. 

We met during the week of December 2021, going into New Year's 2022. We were both young 19-year-olds. I had my apartment and car at the time, and he was a young careless private. We did meet on Tinder, of all places, and instantly clicked over text. Not too long after, we FaceTimed, and oddly enough, I thought we would stay friends cause we clicked so well. Soon enough, I drove 40 minutes to the base to meet him for the first time. I was anticipating just hanging out and wasn‚Äôt nervous at all. Then his 5‚Äô11 buff built self came in.  We locked eyes, and my entire body was stunned. He felt familiar. There was a spark, for sure.
I let him be my passenger prince and play music. We pulled up to my place and ate the pizza, he put on one piece, and we were lying watching the movie. One thing led to another, and we were two young 19-year-olds fuckin like bunnies. From there, a very intense, lust-fueled, and passionate relationship blossomed. The conversations were in-depth, diverse, and intriguing. The sex was great. Overall was a great addition to my life and company. I‚Äôd like to have around for a while. Keep in mind while this was all happening, he was divorcing his wife. He also wasn‚Äôt able to see his at the time one-year-old daughter. I would ask here and there how he felt about it, but he never liked talking about it too much. I didn‚Äôt want to prick and pry, so I left it alone. By the end of the month, his divorce was about to be finalized. Based on how we discussed things, I thought we were building something for it to be official in 5-6 months. Boy, was my little mind wrong lmao. He slowly started to pull away. I began chasing.
By my birthday, I ended up cussing him out over text and blocking him cause he couldn‚Äôt reach out and say anything. I was crazy and called him from a burner number, and he instantly answered. I know that is mature of me‚Ä¶ I left it alone. I was heartbroken because I felt like he had ghosted me on my birthday. I was fine for a few months, and then I reached out again in April of ‚Äò22. He apologized for doing what he did and said he didn‚Äôt do the arguing, so he just pulled away. Plus, his divorce was a lot on him.  I was understanding. I was going to let him come over again, but he ended up flaking again. I ofc got mad and blocked him because he buttered me up, got NSFW vids, and dipped. I stopped fw with him for damn near the rest of the year, but after him creeping into my mind again, I reached out in December of ‚Äò22. By this time, my car was long totaled (not my fault), and I moved back in with my family as I couldn't afford to live alone. This time his depression was apparent. He said he felt numb daily, but I made him feel something. He was sorry for everything he did to me, but he wasn‚Äôt in the space to give me what I wanted, but in the future, he did. He said he missed me and that I didn‚Äôt deserve all that he did to me. We had sex in his car that night, and then he was off to Korea. While he was in Korea, I tried to be friends with him, but we simply had dry conversations, besides when I told him a guy had violated me. Now this has all culminated to the present day. I hit him up last night. We had such different energy this time around.
We discussed the past, and I apologized for every time I spazzed out. He didn‚Äôt deserve it. Every time he stopped talking was because he was overwhelmed, depressed, working, or I cussed him out. He picked me up, hugged and kissed me, and opened my door. Then we drove off. We caught each other up about what‚Äôs been happening since we last spoke; I listened to his stories in Korea; I told him how I went to the club with a girl who ended up trying to fight me and how I‚Äôm taking summer classes. We laughed and overall had a great time. This was the first time we hung out without having sex. I asked him straight up if he wanted to go with the flow. He said yes, and we agreed to take baby steps. He dropped me off, kissed me a bunch while hugging me, and drove off. Should I take this chance? I saw our growth, but I don‚Äôt want the same story ending. I‚Äôm 4 months celibate, and been really focusing on myself. I‚Äôm open to having him in my life again cause we can go to the gym together, get money together, and see if we can build something. At the same time he has a avoidant attachment style while I have anxious attachment style. I wanted to add his child lives in a different state with her mother and her boyfriend. He and her were in a bitter custody battle, and he did lose. He was homelessness a couple of weeks, and has only semi-recently stabilized himself. He tries to see his baby as much as possible, but because he can literally be deployed at random it‚Äôs hard to coordinate anything in person, so he FaceTimes and calls her.",throwawaybby02120825,1,1690774550.0,1.0,5123,999,5123

"Anyone feel like dating is too fast paced? I might just be naive, I'm 26M never had anyone (I'm quiet, don't like going out etc) and just got rejected after a couple dates and talking for a bit over a month, hung out a few other times.

I just feel like from reading lots of articles and posts/comments that people don't give anyone the time or effort to get to know one another. Maybe I'm just not a good people reader but I feel 1-2 dates is not enough unless of course there is an immediate reason to not see this person anymore. 

Another thing is the ""spark"". I feel like people are going around only focusing on feeling that immediate connection, looking for instant gratification and focusing on the reasons to not date them. Again, people have every right to do this but I feel dating apps/society/movies have given people unrealistic expectations of partners because they can just simply message the next person on their phone. But saying that, I can understand that people don't want to waste time. But then again, I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.

She told me she felt safe and comfortable and that I was a breath of fresh air for once and said I'm an awesome person etc. We had some things in common but she didn't feel a spark so we should just be friends. I respect that but I just don't really understand it. Like, why not try and build a connection and look for reasons to be with this person until the reasons to not date them overwhelm those. Try and make you're own spark and build your own fire, because I feel like that is way more beneficial down the track if things get rough because you can fall back on your core values of what you built together rather than falling back on nothing but infatuation.

That's just my 2c anyway. Maybe I just don't understand females or I just don't have enough emotional trauma to understand people these days and my soul is a LOT older than I am üòÇ I can say I tried dating once now so I'll go back into hermit mode for a while and maybe try again in a few years",Mundane-Astronomer61,1,1690772142.0,1.0,2030,381,2030

"Do I need to step up as a ‚Äúman‚Äù and help my GF with car insurance? Do I need to ‚Äústep up as a man‚Äù (M21) or am I being mistreated by my GF? (F21) I have been with my GF for 5 years. We broke up last year and we got back together after 4 months. My life was hectic and so was hers and so we formed a strong bond with one another. Over the years there has been trial and tribulations. Her mom had a mid life crisis and went crazy. when she turned 18 she kicked her out of the house and divorced her husband. Which left my gf living with me.

Her and my mom didn‚Äôt get along so she moved out with her best friend (she was living rent free with us and choose to pay rent with her friend)  eventually she broke up with me because of how it was effecting me emotionally. Fast forward months and here we are, her friend is moving which means she needs another place to live. On top of that she got a DUI and her insurance is now 600$ a month. She works one job and for some reason won‚Äôt get another, she claims mentally she is drained. The issue started 3 days ago when she was crying. I asked her what was wrong and a whole can of worms was unleashed 


She wants me to put her on my moms insurance . with her as a secondary . And then said her step father said it was my turn as a man to step up and help her out. She then said she dosent understand how I could know what‚Äôs she‚Äôs going through and ‚Äúwatch her suffer‚Äù and that if I can‚Äôt do the insurance asked if I could help expunge her Record. I said this was a lot and that I needed time to think. She then called me selfish and talked about how I have never helped her‚Ä¶ and that I have a few days to decide ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs important ‚Äú she said I was also selfish for not agreeing to an apartment that I would pay more then her for ‚Äúsince my income is higher‚Äù She said so many couples do this and that I‚Äôm selfish for not wanting to do it for her. I then told her that I‚Äôm 21 and shouldn‚Äôt have to be responsible for her situation.  She then told me to let her know so she could find a man that will help her if I won‚Äôt. 

That same night she apologized and said she said a lot of things that she didn‚Äôt mean. And that she loves me and is just going through a very difficult time. I love her but don‚Äôt know how to handle this, she crossed a boundary however I love her and don‚Äôt want to kick her when she‚Äôs down:/ 


Thank you if you have read this far. It‚Äôs breaking my heart but I have no clue what to do in this situation. I‚Äôm nervous that if I help her again it might bite me in the ass like when I moved her into my house. And advise is appreciated.

I‚Äôm not really picky and I don‚Äôt have a type at all, but I even seem to fail in situationships with the lowest standards. I‚Äôm at the bottom of the pyramid, and I feel as if I only receive leftovers. I would say i‚Äôm smart, and my personality isn‚Äôt at all bad, but when people see my skin it automatically makes a bad impression on them(from my experience).",Top-Job-4783,1,1690435677.0,0.6,617,122,617
"Not exclusive but still feel weird about seeing other people Im seeing this girl, it‚Äôs long distance. I like her a lot. She got out of a relationship 3 months ago  and says she needs time to heal. She said she‚Äôs trying and I can see that, but also understands I can‚Äôt wait forever and said it‚Äôs okay if I see other people while she heals. She said she does want a future with me, but needs to be healed before committing. Because once she commits she will be seeing a long term future with me. I also want a future with her, but have been in a situation where I‚Äôve waited and ended up wasting time. There‚Äôs this other  girl I‚Äôm supposed to see in a couple of days and I do want to see her but also have a gut wrenching feeling about it. I feel confused and don‚Äôt understand why I feel this way. I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs because I like this overseas girl so much it‚Äôs hard to be with others.

"Is she interested? Person I work with seems to notice me a lot and I notice her too. She goes out of her way it seems to talk to me and asked what I had planned for the weekend. Afterwards, I kind of kicked myself for not just saying ‚Äúhey we should get together‚Äù. Truth be told, I‚Äôm really bad at picking up signals and I‚Äôm cautious because we work together indirectly, however I‚Äôve dated coworkers where things haven‚Äôt worked out and we‚Äôve kept things professional. 
Just seems like she notices me often and goes out of her way to talk to me. Notices when I got a hair cut, when I‚Äôm not wearing a common clothing item, noticed when I‚Äôm working on a different location and asks about it.

"Is my current boyfriend not good for me? Now I know if I have to ask that question, he‚Äôs probably not. The reason why I‚Äôm asking here, is I‚Äôm not sure who I can go to in my life right now to discuss this with, so hello Reddit lol. Thanks for taking the time to read. 

I‚Äôm not going to get into it too much, but we‚Äôve been friends since highschool and are coming up on our one year anniversary. We‚Äôve been in the same friend group and he decided to pursue me last year, very thoughtfully. I had been out of the dating scene for quite a while (5 years to be exact, I‚Äôm 23, still pretty young but ya know) and I was definitely swooned. Considering we‚Äôve been close friends for so long and I had a budding attraction as the idea began being introduced, I took a while with myself to make sure I wasn‚Äôt committing out of loneliness. 

However, when we started dating, I saw a huge shift in who he is, or maybe I just started picking up on stuff that I ignored for years, because I hadn‚Äôt thought of him romantically until last year. Whatever it was/ is, it‚Äôs made me question a bunch about myself and him. I like to think I people read as well as the next person, but this man is not easily read. I‚Äôm concerned firstly, he said one of the reasons he pursued me is because he admired how empathetic I can be, whereas, he struggles with empathy. He‚Äôs very logical, and has a strict set of principles he follows. Originally, I thought it was sweet bc he made it seem like he wanted to learn from me and I found it highly respectable that he knew that about himself, and thought I was the one able to help him improve, but anytime I try to breakdown empathy with him, he seems incapable of putting himself in someone else‚Äôs shoes, and his sympathy feels forced, if that makes sense.I find it difficult to teach someone how to be empathetic, especially when they push back, which he does. 2.) he‚Äôs outwardly said to me he gets enjoyment out of pushing people to the point of frustration, ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs right.‚Äù And he is definitely very smart, and a lot of times, is right. Like I said, very logical. But my gut screams at me bc that doesn‚Äôt sit right with me, but then again, I am the opposite. He runs toward conflict, I tend to avoid it like the plague. 2.) rarely does he apologize, but I also haven‚Äôt been great at expressing my feelings towards him these past couple months.3.) he‚Äôs going for nursing, ultimately, wants to be a mental health professional. I worked as a pca for the last couple years at a hospital, i of course love that he is! But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm concerned because I myself have a variety of mental health disorders (ptsd being the root), and I fully accept that I have not been doing what I need to do to care for myself, nor do I expect him to be my personal therapist. I have a therapist for that, just haven‚Äôt worked up the courage to address this with her, mostly bc I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll confirm my suspicions, and encourage me to get out. (Another ah ha moment)

I have noticed as I had been struggling mentally, he is unable to think about how the emotions are affecting me, and he is the very first person to ever tell me I‚Äôm difficult to talk with. I‚Äôve prided myself on having enough emotional self control to separate my emotions and weigh them with logic (rationalizing, which he does a great job) but he brings out a side of me that I don‚Äôt recognize, and it‚Äôs angry. However, I felt at times he pushed me to the point of breaking, or maybe it‚Äôs a combo of the things I haven‚Äôt resolved yet. 

Anywho, I know that‚Äôs a lot and I said I‚Äôd keep it short. So much to unpack, it‚Äôs the shortest I can make it. So thank you for taking the time to read this ü´∂lmk what you think. **I want to avoid labels because it is not my place to say a person is this or that, I‚Äôll leave that up to the professionals.** so, if you are able, I‚Äôd appreciate if you left those out :)",Ok_Procedure_3988,1,1690434410.0,0.99,3872,743,3872
"I'm confused if guy 34M still interested in me or not I recently had 5 dates with a guy, which last 3 of those were consecutive like M, T, W. 

We had kissed/held hands on our 2nd date and on 3rd date, we ended up having sex. 

On 4th date (which was more like him stopping by at coffee shop where I was), we simply talked for few hours until coffee shop closed. Didn't become physical... which made me wonder if he was pulling away or if he was just tired.. 

On 5th date, we watched movie again ... walked around the park for 2 hours.. held hands,, talked about past relationship... our firsts impression of each other.. what he or I think it's important in relationship. He is observant type of person .. he said I will get surprised even more as we get to know each other.. Night went well.  

However, unlike previous dates, he didn't make any plans to meet like he used to. 

So I'm getting little anxious whether or not he is slowly losing interest or if he is wanting me to initiate date... 

(In terms of texting, we text few times a day. It's either him or me who initiate text but sometimes he is slow to respond.. sometimes fast.... whereas I am usually fast to respond... we talked about this .. and it seemed like we just had different type of texting style but still unsure if he is not that into me or what...) 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I'm just worried about being ghosted because last guy I met who I had 3 dates literally vanished... out of no where...

"Had some ED issues while on a date. Wish I knew the cause. I had a date with an indian woman I met at a club. She's 32, works in IT, and still a virgin and wanted lose the V that night. I got to her place, we had some pizza then got into the foreplay.

I should mention that on the bus ride to her place, I started to get some ""hot"" feelings in my bowel but they quickly subsided, therefore I ignored it.¬†

I wanted to have foreplay like I used to with my ex: Where we'd shower first, then use hands on each other, oral then sex. This girl wanted to do it differently. As me and her stripped down to our underwear, I fingered her and she jerked me. We had discussed what she'd like to do before and she said she was happy to do oral with me going down and she returns the favor, however that night she didn't want me going down on her and wanted me to go straight to the sex.¬†

The ""hot"" feeling was on and off now in the bowel and I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious but I also wanted to focus on this.¬†
I tried to enter her but for some reason I lost my erection right as I put on the condom. I still tried anyway but she was too tight and I went too soft so we couldn't continue.

I didn't want to use the bathroom but the ""hot"" feeling got worse and I had to go. She was cool with letting me stay and watching a few movies but I ended up having to get up a few times throughout the night to go back and forth to the bathroom. It was some bad diarrhea.¬†

I felt ashamed of not being able to get it up since I do watch a fair bit of porn while using sex chat rooms. I have been doing this for sessions of 4-8 hours and twice a week. I am trying to manage this use.

I have lost attraction to that Indian woman now and I think she might feel the same. I wish I knew why I couldn't get it up even though I have my suspicions.",2guyshangingoutnaked,1,1690433519.0,0.67,1828,382,1828
"How to choose whether to be exclusive with someone ? During high school and college, I (M23) was interested in dating a few people at various points, but they were never interested in dating me. Now that I'm out of college, I started using Hinge, and the situation is completely reversed. I'm not really sure why (I've never felt attractive before and I didn't glow up or start making massive amounts of money after college), but I get a lot of matches --- enough that I can go on dates most days of the week if I want to. I'm happy about getting to actually date for the first time in my life, and it is a lot of fun, but I'm completely new to the experience of having to consider multiple potential dating partners at once (in the past I usually became close friends with someone specific before I started to be interested in dating them, so my potential dating partners never numbered more than 1).The problem is that after 5-6 dates, the question of exclusivity comes up, and I feel a lot of pressure to go exclusive with whoever I started going on dates with first. By then I can tell that I'm attracted to them and find them interesting, but usually I don't know them nearly as well as I've known the people who I liked in the past and therefore don't feel the same way about them. So the natural questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) If I like someone after 5-6 dates but they don't make me feel the same way as someone from my past who didn't want to date me, should I agree to date them exclusively when they ask ?  It makes sense that those feelings might develop from putting more focus on getting to know them as a result of being exclusive, but it also feels like a lot of risk to commit to dating someone when I don't feel that way about them yet. It also feels like I'm leading someone on if I agree to that when I know I don't yet feel about them the same way I felt about someone else in the past (although it took a lot longer than 5-6 meetings to feel that way about that someone else).

&amp;#x200B;

(2) If I agree to date someone exclusively, and then a few months later (even if the dating experience is nothing but positive and I am still attracted to them and find them interesting) I conclude that I really don't feel the same way about them as I did about someone else from my past who didn't want to date me, should I break up with them ?  It feels wrong and entitled to do that to someone who cares about me and contributes something positive to my life, especially based on a comparison with someone who didn't care about me in the same way. I obviously know how much it hurts to be rejected by someone you are close to, and I hate the idea of making someone feel that way. If that is an okay thing to do (as opposed to staying in the relationship that is working fine for everyone), does anyone have any advice on how to break up with someone after a few months of dating exclusively in a way that is as respectful and polite and non-hurtful as possible ?  I know that it will have to hurt them no matter what, but I've been rejected inreally cruel ways that made me feel awful about myself and I don't want to do that to someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) \[a variant of (1)\] The following situation has happened to me twice so far: I download Hinge, and start going on dates with people. I end up having gone on 5-6 dates with the first person I matched with (""person A""), and there's a few others who I've gone on \~3 dates with who I also like (""persons B-D""). But by this point person A is asking for an exclusive dating relationship. It's a really hard choice to make because I haven't gotten to know people B-D as well yet (and as remarked in (1), in absolute terms I don't know any of them that well yet), and I don't have much prior dating experience. Of course I could ask person A for more time being non-exclusive in order to be more sure about each other --- obviously this depends on the woman, but (among women who want a serious long-term relationship) are people typically okay with this or do they typically take this as a sign of general unwillingness to commit and decide to stop dating ? If the consensus is that asking for more time from person A might as well be ""breaking up"", do people have advice about what to consider when choosing between continuing to date person A or not ?",troybarnes691,1,1690432957.0,1.0,4330,822,4330
"Confused and torn. How do I move on I went through a sudden and unexpected breakup about a year ago that I can only compare emotionally to the pain I‚Äôve had when family members die.

"Venting about a date I'm a 26m, went on a date the other day.
I had some money set back cause the date was planned a week ahead of time, so I had $120 (usd). I told him that we could do whatever or go wherever and that I didn't know him well enough to plan it well without discounting him. 

We just drive around a while and ended up just getting fast food (25ish dollars from a Hardee's)

We went to a park to eat and chat and there were like, two guys just walking around being odd. The dude I'm with says ""they are just cruising"" I had to ask what that meant and be awkward as fk, and the two dudes kept staring at us. The dude I'm with finally decides to drove away after like 30 min of sitting there. (I felt like he may have knew them or something, cause he acted weird).

He was looking at his phone most the date looking at others on different dating apps, he didn't seem to care about much I said and most the date seemed to be him either venting on his job (which doesn't bother me usually) or the aforementioned phone scrolling. How I know what he was looking at is... he showed me, like almost proud of it. I've never felt so small in my life. I just played it off and tried to brush past it.

I'm not proud of it, but we ended up somewhere secluded and etc etc etc. 

I tried talking with him after and it seemed like he was not interested. 

I didn't really post this for any reason beyond trying to understand how I feel by writing this out and trying to deal with my emotions on it. I deleted that dating app cause after being on it fir a while and everyone basically fell into *wanting to marry after 2 weeks of chatting on an app* or *use you and drop you in less then 2 dates while pretending to be interested, to then ghost you*.

I'm gonna take a good long break from trying to date. I've got a lot of things to work on before I feel comfortable trying to, I dunno, flounder around?

"Thinking about reaching out to my ex My ex and I broke up about a month ago and we haven‚Äôt spoken at all since.

"I feel as if I had lost the love of my life There‚Äôs this guy, that i‚Äôll call Gerard, i met him (almost) 5 years ago.  When i first met him, he was the kindest guy i had ever met in my whole life. As time passed, Me and Gerard fell in love, we dated for around 6 months (all this, being a long distance relationship), everything seemed ok to me, but then suddenly he told me he found another girl, naturally, i was confused, but i already expected that since he had been acting weird the days before that. I don‚Äôt remember much, but i do remember that we had been losing all the communication we had. When he told me he got someone new, we had an argument and decides to stop talking to each other (Here it was already 2019). This did not last long, we only distanced for one month, we both apologized and were in good terms once again. Ever since that, we kept on talking, but i couldn‚Äôt see him like that again. By December of 2019, i started slowly having a crush on someone, i‚Äôll call her Ale, i ofc told him since after all i trust him way more than i even trust myself, he was ok with it. Here comes an important part, one that i regret so much. Gerard confessed to me on 2020, precisely on Valentine‚Äôs Day. I was flattered, but again, i already liked someone else by that time. I had to (sadly) reject him. I regret rejecting him so much. One month after that, i started dating Ale. He was always there to support me even though i wasn‚Äôt in a relationship with him. Soon then, arguments started with Ale, long story short, i was being constantly mentally abused by Ale. Gerard always told me that Ale was being a total jerk and that i should leave her. I didn‚Äôt. I regret not doing so, but i was blinded by my feelings. As time passed, i ended up breaking up with Ale in 2021 since she cheated. Gerard always supported me emotionally, he was always there for me. We did date by this time, but i told him that i wasn‚Äôt ready to have a relationship. Soon then, 2022 came in. We still talked a lot by January, even February, maybe. But that communication started going down, slowly. He told me he no longer wanted to talk to me by the time by August of the same year. I was hurt, sure, but i told him that i was ok with that. Time passed, and we started talking again this year, on May. We both talked it out, and started talking daily. We called almost every day at nights. It was the first time in a while i‚Äôve ever felt so damned love by someone. If i had to be honest, he is the best guy i‚Äôve ever met. He treats me so sweetly that it even overwhelms me. Everything was fine, until a week ago. He told me he needed time. I obviously understood it and told him i was okay with that if it was the best for him. But, i do miss him a lot. I‚Äôve cried. I‚Äôm crying now. And there‚Äôs so much more than that, i always find myself missing him no matter the relationship i‚Äôm in. I just feel as if he was the correct one, idk how to explain it. But i‚Äôve never felt that for someone ever before. It hurts but i also like it. But at the same time i still don‚Äôt know. Back then, we were both young. I know he was grown up and obviously matured as well. But i‚Äôm scared. I love him, yes. But my heart gets very confused.

"Advice on falling for my bff. There‚Äôs a catch I F and my best friend M met 2 years ago and started talking as friends. As the days have gone by we have gotten each other through tough times and we have grown a strong connection to each other seeming as though we are on the same wavelength. We have a lot of the same thoughts, interests and, opinions and we often say what the other is thinking. He has given me sound advice and tells me what I need to hear and not what I want to hear and has always been forward and honest with me as I have been with him. I have never had a friendship or relationship this strong with anybody and I have never felt such a deep rooted connection with someone as I have with him. I truly love this man as my best friend and hope we can stay best friends no matter what. But as the connection between us has grown so has our attraction for each other. The problem is though that he is married and has expressed to me his deep intentions of staying loyal even before we noticed any attraction towards each other. He told me when we first met he would never cheat and doesn‚Äôt understand people who cheat and has told me he plans to stay with his wife and does love his wife. They however tend to think very differently and have opposite opinions and views and bicker which is of course normal in marriage. But where he tends to struggle is that he has an incredibly high sex drive and she does not and often pushes him away.

"Acceptable to ask out a job applicant that was rejected? I understand that asking a coworker out is frowned on these days. Yet my parents met each other at work. I wouldn't be here if they didn't have a relationship.

I recently interviewed a candidate. She was rejected by other managers. I did not reject her application and she was my first pick. She was my first pick based on her professionalism and skills. So her application rejection had no agenda on my part. She has no future prospects at the company.

I really enjoyed talking to her. I felt that we were very in sync during the interview. She was obviously polite since it's an interview but it just felt like time flew by. After I phoned her about the rejection she also asked me if she could connect on linked in (not sure if this is common practice).

There's no power that I hold over her at this point. I've clearly told her that she won't be hired. And if she was employed I would not ask her out under any conditions, because we would not only be co-workers but I would also have been her boss.

I assume the resounding answer here will be that asking her out is predatory and stupid. Yet a female coworker made a joke to me that I could ask her out now that she's been rejected. This was after expressing that I was disappointed in her being rejected.

Thoughts?

\- Would it be creepy if I reached out a few weeks after the rejection to ask her out on a date?

\- Is asking for a linkedin connection from the person hiring you after being rejected normal? Is this an indication of interest?",giveuporfindaway,1,1690428522.0,0.67,1561,292,1561

"My 19F boyfriend 18M broke up with me after almost 2 years A little background: my now ex (I‚Äôll call him Dan) and I were very close a few years before getting together but stopped talking due to me getting into a toxic relationship and not being ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to talk to guys. Almost as soon as I got out of the relationship, we rekindled out spark and fell hard and fast for each other. Over the past let‚Äôs say 2 years, Dan and I have had an amazing relationship. He helped me heal with what I had went through in that toxic relationship and we spent almost all of our time together. We moved up to college together. The only thing was we would fight. Now I understand every relationship has its arguments but sometimes we argued a lot and I take the blame for most of those fights. I would get upset over little things and it would spiral into an argument. But after every fight we came back and we were constantly going out to dates or just spending time together. Fast forward to a couple days ago. Him and I were the happiest we had been in a long time but we got into a pretty big fight. We both did things very wrong in that fight. The fight boiled down to how I felt like the effort and respect he used to give me was a lot less than what he was giving me now. I felt very upset because we had talked about what we both needed from each other and I gave him everything he head asked for but I felt as if I was hardly getting anything I said I needed. We went back and forth for a couple days saying if we were together or not and it crushed me to imagine myself without the person I felt was my person. The other night he had decided that we would be together and work on it together but I was terrified that he would would back out or leave again and lo and behold he did the next day. We had a very good talk and both agreed that we could go back to just being friends but honestly I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll hurt me more and I don‚Äôt know how to just be friends with him. I love him with all my heart but I‚Äôm also scared of being hurt again. We also agreed that maybe once he got the mental help he needs that maybe we can try us again. Any advice. I was so in love with him and even though I know we are young I feel like what we had was special. He would talk about me to everyone he talked to and he would spoil me like crazy. We were practically living together so I don‚Äôt know how to go to bed by myself or not see him every day. Sorry for the long post I am new to Reddit.

"Creepy/Negative Reaction to Rejection So I‚Äôve recently tried dating and so far it‚Äôs been a bust. I haven‚Äôt dated in awhile, but man I‚Äôve never had these type of reactions before.

Another guy and I found out we were looking for different things. He actually mentioned it first in which I just agreed. He got all creepy and was basically begging to continue after‚Ä¶ (it was very confusing).

"Confused 26 M 27 F Im confused....

im so confused....  I thought this girl at work liked me... we sit by each other, she isn't a manager or a higher position, simply another co worker who works in a different department. Our teams just sit with each other. For weeks on end we had this back and forth looking at each other ""game"". eye contact, holding eye contact, smiles etc. She made is very obvious of her looking at me.  I always sat a seat behind her and to her right. She would make it obvious of her turning around to look at me then once I ""caught"" her she turned around super fast. Things like this happened for like a month straight. I got the courage to start talking to her for past couple weeks and so far she seems genuinely happy to talk to me, by her voice, her smile etc. BUT this is where im so confused. I texted her asking her how's she's doing because she didn't come into the office. She IGNORED my message for the second time and left me on read..... everyone at works uses the work messenger which is Microsoft teams. This was the first time texting her in a month because the first time she ignored my first message. Even at the very beginning when I texted her after meeting her for the first time, she wasn't short but has short responses. At the time I brushed it off. Ive made other friends from her team she's on and me and them casually text each other during the day. BUT when it comes to her, she doesent reply.... like do you know how to talk? text? communicate? this isn't hard.... like hello? What does it mean when a girl shows interest to you in person but when it comes to messages at work they act the complete opposite??

"Need some tips on my little situation. (Dating/social skills) Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I‚Äôve recently started talking to this girl, she‚Äôs 28, I‚Äôm 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we‚Äôre probably more friends than anything else.
We‚Äôve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I‚Äôm shy and I can‚Äôt really find anything to talk about that we‚Äôd have in common. She‚Äôs a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can‚Äôt be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it‚Äôll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,1,1690455052.0,1.0,1495,279,1495
"Signs that your ex still miss you ? What are the chances of getting back tgt Context:

She felt that it‚Äôs unfair because she treat me as a priority in her life but I didn‚Äôt manage to treat her as the main priority.

"Outdated or new normal? Hi all, 

Male, 40, divorced here. 

I‚Äôve been through the ringer the last year, but have taken time to find myself once again and work on myself via therapy, friends and working out, of course. It‚Äôs a process and so I know more time is needed and one is never a complete human. 

My question pertains to a couple of patterns I have encountered while dipping my toe into the dating pool. 

Both encounters for me went way better in person than via text and I felt like I‚Äôd established enough of a connection to maintain contact via text until the next meeting, which hadn‚Äôt happened. 

I am an open person and I‚Äôm not afraid to have tough conversations for better clarity. I would rather someone tell me that they‚Äôre not interested than what I am seeing via text.

It almost seems to me that expressing interest in seeing them, trying to have loose playful conversations before meeting, worked for me in the past. Admittedly, that was before online dating and texting became standard operating procedure.

I understand that maybe these women were not entirely interested in me from my recent experience. I had a good time with both of them and felt that perhaps something would come of it.

My question is, do y‚Äôall feel that the text game is one where you express limited interest, without much inclination to meet in order to be a viable match. 

What I‚Äôve seen on that end, is very limited texting, more recently, a text or two a day with only a couple sentences. For me that put a lot of pressure to say something meaningful while matching their effort. Needless to say, both dates fizzled out in the virtual world. 

I‚Äôm not interested in being anyone other than myself (playing games to increase interest), but I do understand that the nature of dating has changed, the conversation style has changed, and I think, despite the promiscuousness of the scene, people are more guarded with their thoughts than their bodies. 

Am I accurate or am I just an outdated model of a man? 

Help me improve and get a much needed update. I don‚Äôt want to game the system, but I also don‚Äôt want to lose good connections from the wild whilst trying to manage the virtual realm poorly as I see it now. 

Many thanks, and I appreciate ya‚Äôll who take the time to respond and consider what I‚Äôm asking.",FabulousBase9194,1,1690545104.0,1.0,2311,413,2311
"Is he dating his baby mother or me after everything? 
I met someone at my first ever job. I‚Äôm 22 and he‚Äôs 33. He‚Äôs got a baby mum and two kids (7 and 3/4), he stays at their house together and states he sleeps on the sofa.

He never mentioned his situation until after we slept together, he then proceeds to say that he thought I knew as everyone at work knew. I carried on believing that he was single as he‚Äôd reassure me but then someone at work said they saw him with his baby mum hugging and kissing her which he denied outright. Then he went on holiday with her for the kids and said he didn‚Äôt want to upset the kids as he booked it when they were together, he stated that he got a single room. When he was on holiday I asked him and he said there was a problem with the single room so he‚Äôs in the same room but they split the beds. If I hadn‚Äôt asked he wouldn‚Äôt have mentioned it and I‚Äôm going off the fact that he was there for a couple of days. He won‚Äôt even tell me his baby mums first name, he goes why do you want to know but I don‚Äôt understand if he is single then why is he so secretive. 

He told me he‚Äôs in love with me and he has never felt this way about anyone. He treated my like I‚Äôm special and important, he told me that I act really mature for my age. He was caring and attentive. He was funny and sweet. He told me I‚Äôm the prettiest girl he‚Äôs ever been with, he states that I‚Äôm an upgrade from his baby mum etc.

I fell pregnant and he threatened suicide and guilt tripped me into getting an abortion stating that having kids ruins your body, I am destined for better things etc. He made me feel bad by stating that I‚Äôm trying to baby trap him etc. Long story short I got the abortion. 

He always came to my place, I live alone and I only know what area he lives in, he knows so much about my life and I barely know anything about his. 

He said he needs time to fix up and he doesn‚Äôt expect me to wait nor could he ask that of me but he‚Äôd wish I did. He told me she said they are done as he previously ‚Äúcheated‚Äù on her when he was away on a boys holiday and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs genuinely over but the way he feels about me is genuine, at the same time he mentioned that they were on and off multiple times so it‚Äôs hard to believe him. He states they are over and he will move out really soon but the economic situation of the country makes me think otherwise. 

I lost my virginity to him and I can‚Äôt get him out of my head but after all the bad he‚Äôs done it‚Äôs so difficult to forgive and move past it. 

Currently he is blocked but I constantly think about unblocking him and trying to resolve things. I need advice as I can‚Äôt get him out of my mind no matter what I do. I‚Äôm in love with him, I genuinely consider him my first love and no matter how hard I try I can‚Äôt stop thinking he‚Äôll fix up for me.",Fickle_Industry2965,1,1690452278.0,0.67,2825,576,2825
"We spent every moment of two weeks together, now he tells me about the other girl. Sorry about the long post, but this is my first post here and wanted to give the full story.

A month ago (23F) started this thing with a friend (27M) of mine. I was out of a 3 year relationship and had something going on afterwards with a close friend (24M). Let‚Äôs call 27M A and 24M B.  The thing with B had ups and downs and it was never anything exclusive. During this period A started showing a lot of interest in me, texting and asking to do things together. We weren‚Äôt very close back then but I always enjoyed his company so I was always up for it as well. We started to hang out a lot and got along so well. When we got drunk we were always flirting with each other and I really liked the attention and always found him very attractive. Getting along so well was an added bonus. Other people started to notice this and I got asked a few times if there was anything going on between A and I. A friend of mine who is way closer with A also told me that this guy really likes me and I should stop with B whatever that is and go for this guy (also because B was flirting with this other girl). 

I was quite confused at this stage because even though I really liked B it was always a bit problematic with him and now A charmed me a lot. For other reasons we stopped seeing each other romantically with B and decided to stay good friends. 

After a night out together with all of our friends, we went to A‚Äôs place to have an after party but nobody else was up for it. That night we stayed up till the morning and when I wanted to go home he asked me to stay over. We just cuddled all night and spent the next day together in bed, nothing else happened. Next day after a dinner at our friends place, A asked me to come over again, so I stayed at his place and we had sex. From that night onwards for about 2 weeks we slept together every night, spent the next day together and did a lot of fun things together. It was an amazing time but in the end I went back home for the summer and he will move to another country end of summer.

I always thought we wouldn‚Äôt talk a lot when I‚Äôm back home but we texted so far everyday and he wanted to call me quite often. We make each other laugh a lot, have a great connection going on and are very attracted to each other. But he is moving away so I wanted to ask him what would happen then. I never wanted a serious relationship, especially nothing long distance but I felt like I had to communicate my feelings. When I told him that I really like spending time with him and talking to him but it confuses me as well because he is moving away - he replied back with if I knew what is going on with his ex at the moment. I knew a bit but not so much in detail. So with this girl it never worked out because they were never at the same place at the same time and she never wanted anything exclusive at the time with him, so they agreed to see how it goes when he moves back to the city she lives in. 

We never had a conversation with each other about what we wanted from each other, I guess were both sure that we didn‚Äôt want anything serious but then we connected really well and it ended up being more than that. I‚Äôm confused because when I told him about my feelings and doubts, instead of him talking about his feelings he opened up the subject of his ex even though it was never a concern before. It seems to me that he avoided expressing his feelings. When I said maybe it‚Äôs better we just stop, he didn‚Äôt want that either. He said that he really likes me and enjoyed our time but can‚Äôt say anything right now because he is confused. He wanted sometime to think and meanwhile wants to keep in touch. He also asked me if it‚Äôs suppose to be everything or nothing.

Now I‚Äôm left wondering if in the end our connection was not so special and this was a casual relationship. But even if it is, he doesn‚Äôt want to let go of me. I‚Äôm also confused by what it means to have a casual relationship or if he is being a red flag over all.",smallandfurious69,1,1690545479.0,1.0,4057,808,4057

"My gf told me two weeks back about her depression and anxiety. Things are so confusing now. Help? The whole story is on my profile, however to summarize, my gf has gone through a busy schedule resulting in mental exhaustion and burn out. She told me she cannot handle committment of marriage though she loves me (thats what she told me in our conversation). I managed to calm her down by assuring her that I will be with her till the end and there is no pressure of marriage, im there regardless. 

For the next 2 weeks our conversations were dry, although I got responses to ""I love you"" and such, things have now gone confusing. She would message first, the conversations are not so dry anymore, they are improving gradually but romance is non existence.

"Why do men always expect one thing? (Confused 20F) To start with, I‚Äôm friends with some guys and I also tried going on dates with people. One thing I‚Äôve noticed though is that they ALWAYS expect me to ""pay back for the date"" by having intercourse with them, even if it‚Äôs only the first date. They are way too obsessed with that as whenever I went on any dating apps they straight up offered intercourse to me (sometimes even offering to pay). I could never have a good conversation with anyone without getting hit with some nasty cheesy disrespectful flirty line. 
You might just go ahead and say ""but dating apps are MADE specifically for THAT"". However, dating apps and ""apps for meetups"" are different things. And logging into a dating app I have no idea that all I will get is harassment. 
Even if dating apps have been rethought by men, I can‚Äôt even feel safe around my male friends. Last time I visited my friend of 7 years at his house (because it was raining outside) he casually tried to rape me and then asked me what I expected coming to a man‚Äôs house. (P.S. he had a girlfriend) 
And even when I completely gave up on dating and befriending men and just wanted to practice speaking foreign languages on Tandem, one dude asked me if I was a virgin right after asking me if I could help him practice English. 
I am beyond confused and would like to know if everyone is like this and if that‚Äôs normal??? And if so then why???",Tough_Presentation_5,1,1690869530.0,0.54,1434,266,1434
"Confusion over a man cutting himself off before finishing I am highly confused. I have a friend I met online, we have met only once before this encounter....the first time we hooked up with just making out and mutual masturbation, I thought it was really fun! We communicated after and he said he had fun, although I came and he did not....I only used my hands on him that time, not my mouth. So now, he comes over, we are pressed for time as my babysitter is only watching l.o. til a certain time. He took his pants off and sat on the couch, in the car on the way over, and in texts, I said I wanted to give him oral...we kissed,  I went down on him, he got very hard, pretty fast, was moaning...enjoyed it, precumming, called me a good girl, cuz thats how we play...he had been previously been  playing with and licking my breasts, he suddenly told me-take off your pants! I kinda mildly protested that we didn't have time, it was his turn for an orgasm. He fingered me a bit and we had some pentration, he asked me to come for him, then he hopped off, saying 'I'm finished"" I was like, wait, what, did you cum and I didn't notice? He still had a semi, didnt feel like he was soft inside. He said ""no, I'm just finished"". I'm a pretty big girl, and this was missionary-  he honestly seemed a bit tired. But WHY didn't he try to cum?! Is that not weird, I don't usually have this experience with guys. I asked him if he was okay-he's like yeah, let's save it for next time. Should I just leave it at that? I don't understand. The only other factor is he often boasts about being high (weed) and tonight I thought he smelled like alcohol, I asked and he said no. But it's a possibility. On the way back to drop him off, he was worried that now I'm thinking he's ""not good enough in the sack"" (I didn't say that) . A confidence thing? What gives? I had showered hours before, I don't think my breath was bad, I just don't know. Thanks for reading. I remain kinda curious and confused",AlarmedPause1,1,1690441960.0,0.67,1982,381,1982
"are these signs of attraction or a friendly/flirty personality? so i‚Äôve (f21) been working with this guy (m19/20) at a little part time job for a couple of years now. this past year, i‚Äôve been away at school for the most part, and prior to that, we‚Äôve had a casual work-friend relationship. we used to actually talk to each other about people we were talking to or interested in. but ever since i came back for the winter break, i can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs been acting differently towards me. however, this is a guy who PLENTY of girls at work have had a crush on, and for good reason. he‚Äôs flirty, friendly, and funny- so i just cannot tell if our interactions mean anything. 

i‚Äôll list the important interactions. 

the other day when we worked together, we were chatting when he suddenly asked to see my phone. he ended up taking my phone case off, taking his phone case off, and swapping them. and for the record- we both had the same type of clear phone case, but mine was in much worse condition LMAO. then he opened amazon and bought a new phone case (tbh- this might‚Äôve just been a flex of his money, since he has a higher position and we often joke about his fancy paycheck). i doodled on some sticky note and wrote ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù, giving it to him as a silly thing. he put it in the back of his case. 

the next day, he messaged me on social media. we almost never interact outside of work- we have very very few messages shared between us, and they‚Äôre all very sporadic and random. he sent me a meme saying something along the lines of ‚Äúwhen you have the urge to send them a paragraph at 1am about how you really feel‚Äù. he asked about the video the next time we worked together and joked about how real and true it is LOL. i asked him if he had a girl in mind and he made a joke about how it was me- which sounds damning, but knowing him, this very likely meant nothing. i think he‚Äôs just.. like that üò≠ LOL. 

and the last time we worked together, we only talked for a brief moment before i left. but he asked if i had a boyfriend, to which i said that i was kind of dating someone back at school, but he wasn‚Äôt the love of my life. he asked me if i knew who the love of my life was, and i said no. the rest of the conversation is kind of a blur, but i remember bits and pieces of it. he said something about knowing a guy i could hang out with, and i can‚Äôt remember what he responded with when i asked him who it was.. but then he suggested that if i wanted someone to hang out with, he‚Äôd be down. he said that i seem like a cool person lmaoo. 

later that night, i messaged him on social media to say that i‚Äôd be down to actually hang out if he was up for it. he did not respond or open the dm despite being active online- which makes me concerned about embarrassing myself, but at the same time, we don‚Äôt usually talk outside of work anyway. i just don‚Äôt want things to be awkward, or for him to see me as just another coworker that has a crush on him- because i love being his friend, first and foremost. i don‚Äôt want to ruin our dynamic. 

i think it‚Äôs also worth noting some things besides the no response that are keeping me grounded: he is a very giving, nice guy. when one of my work friends had a crush on him two years ago, he bought her a plant and they even hung out outside of work. he did not have feelings for her. he exchanged christmas gifts with another girl, who he did not have feelings for. he buys our other coworkers lunches. so many girls at our job like him, and it‚Äôs for a good reason- probably exactly the same reasons as me. 

i don‚Äôt know ! i‚Äôm just rambling now. i don‚Äôt want to become obsessive over this guy, but i also want to know if i‚Äôm being delusional or not. are these signs of potential feelings/attraction, or can this be interpreted as normal behavior for a guy with a reputation for being extremely friendly/giving and flirty? 

TLDR: i‚Äôm lowkey catching feelings for a friend at work, who is known for being a heartthrob due to his very friendly/funny/flirty personality. we‚Äôve had a few interactions that are making me kinda delusional, but because he didn‚Äôt respond to my message, i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve misinterpreted everything. i don‚Äôt know how to differentiate signs of actual attraction from a friendly, fake-flirty personality.",ChapterPsychological,1,1690892438.0,1.0,4291,818,4291

"(27M) dating a single mom (36f) with 2 boys (5/7) - ADVICE? Howdy!

Just wanted to pop in here and see what y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinion is of how things are going in this new-ish relationship. This is such a new territory for me being younger and I felt this would be a good spot to breakdown what has happened so far and get y‚Äôall‚Äôs take on it. 


Bio:

Me: 27M, no kids, never married, got out of a long relationship 8 months ago, no relationships in between, works in real estate and I do really well for myself financially. I have always wanted a family, I just needed to get my career right and my last relationship just wasn‚Äôt the right fit with that. 

Her: 36F, 2 boys (5/7), married for 6 years, divorced for 2.5 years, no relationships in between, only seriously interested in one guy prior to me, works in real estate and does enough to get by financially. Her divorce ended mostly because her ex changed and became a POS. He barely sees the kids for 6hrs/wk and every other weekend. 


Background: 

Met on a deal we worked together in April, when it closed she messaged me on FB and gave me her number in case I wanted to work together again. I shot her a text and we hit it off. We started texting a ton and had a lot of fun conversations. We had a business coffee meeting the week after and then scheduled our first date. Drinks after work. I met her kids pretty quickly in the process too. Her kids love me and they are amazing, we get along great and they are a blast. Ex is POS who barely sees them and does not follow his custody orders all the time. He will be late with picking them up and delay things. Custody orders state that another guy can not sleep over with kids present until they go through a vetting process, we have not done that yet. I have passed out a few times with the kids there and no issues have popped up but she makes it very clear I can not spend the night. 


Timeline: 

4/6: closed the deal together and saw her in person for the first time. 
4/19: she gave me her number and we started texting. 
5/4: first coffee business meeting. 
5/9: first meeting with drinks. 
5/11: date playing darts/drinks. 
5/14: met kids and we went bowling. 
5/20: first night at her place alone and we had sex. 
-dates, lunches and time with kids in between-
6/9: she marked she was in a relationship on FB. 
6/16-18: first weekend alone with her at her place, lots of sex. 
6/22: she removed her relationship on FB. 
6/25: weekend with kids and we took them to Six Flags together. 
7/1: first time she came to my house for a bit, had sex again. 
7/2: old fling popped back up. 
7/3: she chose me over him, sex again. 
7/15-16: weekend with kids, shopping and indoor skydiving. 
7/21-23: she was out of town visiting a girlfriend the whole weekend, didn‚Äôt see her at all. 
7/28-31: spent 4 days with her and the kids straight. First time she let me take one of the kids fishing for a bit with just me an him. Each night I stayed until I help them fall asleep, it was a great weekend. 


How our relationship is:

We really get along well, relate to each other with work and we love our sense of humor together. There haven‚Äôt been any major fights or disagreements yet (besides the old fling who tried to come back and she turned him away). Sex is tough as there is not a lot of free time with us and she does not feel comfortable with the kids being in the same house as us, hard for her to get in the mood. I have been financially supporting them a bit since we have been together. I pay for everything when we go out places, I‚Äôve gave her some money when things pop up and she is tight on cash. I don‚Äôt mind supporting them and she has never once asked me for money or anything, I do it voluntarily. Long term wise, she has mentioned it will be awhile before she considers getting married again and I am okay with that, gotta make sure it‚Äôll work out before rushing into that. Her kids want a baby sister but she is getting older. She did not shoot down the idea and I am open to it in the future as well. With that said, if she only wants to have her 2 kids, I am fine with that. Having my own is not as important as being a good father to someone if things get that far. With her youngest being 5, it is enticing having the kids already being 18 by the time I am 40 myself. We are both on the same page religiously and politically. Her friends and family know of me already. We have tried to make plans twice to see her friends but something popped up with them and it got canceled. She does not have a huge social circle (I do not either) but we will both meet each others friends soon. 


Questions:

1- How do you think the relationship is progressing so far? Is it moving too fast or is there something I should be concerned about?

2- Would a single mom let me get this close to her kids if she does not see a long term future with me? I am super close to them now. 

3- She sent me the FB relationship invite first and then removed it herself 2 weeks later. When I eventually asked her about it, she said that she did not want it to interfere with our careers since we‚Äôre both in the same field. I still have my profile as ‚Äúin a relationship‚Äù but she has no relationship info showing. Any ideas here?

4- Sex has been great when we have it. Since we started dating we have had sex 5 times over 2 months. It‚Äôs just hard with her schedule. The only real times we could get are every other weekend or maybe slip something in during her lunch break. Given our busy lives, should we be having more sex than we are or is it going to be this sporadic until we eventually move in together? Is there something I should try to do like schedule it out? It‚Äôs now been 4 weeks since we have slept together or had any alone time. There was a five week gap between the first time we had sex and the 3 times we had it in the last 2 week period. Single/dating moms help!!

5- Texting has went from 100-200 texts/day during the first 1.5 months, to 50 texts/day over the last 1.5 months. Maybe we just got out of our honeymoon phase quick? She eventually always replies to me and we usually talk from morning to bed time. Any ideas?

6- How do things seem to be going overall?

"Dating in the Western world... Western culture has always been applauded as progressive amongst all the different cultures of the world. So it is a big surprise to find that other cultures are actually more progressive than the Western culture in this age and time, especially when it comes to dating.

Traditional norms centered around a boy seeing a girl, asking others about her, getting to know her and then finally going to meet her parents for her hand in marriage. Nowadays that isn't the case anymore. People are ""more civilized"". But sometimes you sit and ask yourself; ""have things really changed for the better, or are we just doing the same thing with a different approach?""

This can be said to be true for the Western culture. Nowadays, following the Western culture, a man sees a woman. In most cases he can't approach her because either the law doesn't allow it or he gives an excuse stating that no one does that anymore. Women as well don't approach men stating that women fear rejection more. This isn't true. People fear things they haven't done before in most cases. So if a man has never approached a woman before, he will fear rejection more than a woman who has approached men.

If traditional norms of women cooking and cleaning is dead, why shouldn't the expectations of men approaching women and taking them out die as well? When a man manages to approach a woman or meet her online, he has to chat for weeks and months, and go on 10 dates before getting a kiss, and 10 more before getting a hand job. This doesn't happen in other cultures around the world. So, if that's the case, which culture can be said to be progressive? 

Why not just be more civilized? Everyone knows what they want. Why deceive yourself by going on 30+ dates just to know someone. Some chat for months before deciding to go on dates. Who has such amount of time to waste. After spending years and countless dates, they end up dating and getting married only to divorce in a few years. The so-called uncivilized cultures spend a few days and start dating and they get married and most never divorce. Ever.",Summer_Smoke,1,1690878372.0,0.6,2107,376,2107
"{Male 25} how could I bring this up? 
I feel like I have a higher libido than most people I‚Äôve spoken to and been with. 
My previous partner that‚Äôs been on and off for 3 years told me I can bring someone else in if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied enough which I refused since that not in my nature. That broke the dynamic quickly. 

I was wondering if I should joke about my sex drive or mention it in dating apps because I like to have multiple rounds and more than just once a day. (I know that can‚Äôt happen everyday) I know now it‚Äôs important for me so it‚Äôs a must , especially if I‚Äôm highly attracted.

"Nervous About How a Double-Day Date Will Go Hey guys,

So I (30m) met this lady online (29f) and really hit it off. Like more than sparks it's electric kinda thing. So I am not worried about  whether she will like me per se; as it is clear she already does. But she is coming for two days and has a kind of wild side. I told her straight up I would love to accompany her but Im not this nightlife trailblazer and she said its ok we would be there for each other and she would teach me etc. My worry is less about impressing her and more about the inconvenience of bar and club hopping (finding one/waiting in line at this heat etc) ruining the vibe of the date.

"Went on a date, we kept texting but now he's barely replying, is that a bad sign? Hi! I'm gay and I met this cute and really nice on a dating app (it was Grindr and we both hate that app, he uninstalled it 1h after). We both look for something serious and have a lot of interests in common, so our conversations are really good and never boring. Before our date he event went to say stuff like ""Well today I'm really ugly but if you like me that way then I'm good with you forever ahah"" kinda as a joke.

We went on a date, we both expressed that we liked it and after that we still talked (one day, one of our convos lasted for 2 consecutive hours).

I haven't had a boyfriend for 6 years and I have a huge history of getting ghosted or people losing interest on me, and replying less frequently is one of the first things that usually happens. I'm afraid that it may be the case, but I wanna make sure if I'm not overreacting or acting clingy.

"Break up with my girlfriend for a *maybe*? I've (22m) been with my girlfriend (21f) for over 3 years, and the first two years went very well. In the last year we had 2 close calls: basically broke up then got back together within like an hour (so not sure if it counts as a breakup). After being together for 3 years, I do feel like its time to move on but I've never found the *right time* to break up, which probably doesn't exist.

Now comes the *new girl*, who is 1-2 years older than me and after knowing her for 7 months I've developed a crush. I've had this thought of breaking up with my girlfriend then eventually getting with the *new girl*, but I'm scared to risk it all for a **maybe**.

It's definitely a **grass is greener on the other side** situation and I don't think I know the new girl well enough, so it feels like a 10% chance at best.

I'm also really scared about how a break up may affect my girlfriend mentally, every close call we've had was especially tough on her. I feel like I am kinda ready to be single again, but I know for a fact that she isn't, and I will significantly affect her mental health if we broke up right now.

Any advice?",randomdreg441,1,1690556394.0,1.0,1168,226,1168
"I expressed my needs to my BF and he felt overwhelmed I‚Äôve (23F) been with my bf (25M) for 5 months. I have a good time every time we hang out together. He makes me very secure and safe. And what‚Äôs more, he is adorably funny, caring, and really affectionate. 

But I‚Äôm seeing patterns of issues and things that make me want to have conversations with him.So the past week we had several conversations about these:

\* How often we see each other: I always have to ask him to stay with me for 2 nights on weekends. He would prefer if he only stays for 1 night because he sleeps better on his bed. He mentioned that one time he stayed for 2 nights at my place he didn‚Äôt have a great Monday the next week, and he needed good rest because he has a demanding work schedule (he works overtime), which I totally understand but I get attached and would miss him a lot. To be clear we only see each other once during the week or none at all (I come over to his place during the week cuz I have more flexible schedules). And weekend is usually when we spend most time together. He felt overwhelmed. I mentioned that I want to see him once during the week and 2 nights on the weekend, which made him feel like, at this speed, we were gonna see each other every day. And that is too fast for him. But I never said I want us to see each other every day. I feel misunderstood.

\* Sex: I expressed that I don‚Äôt get very turned on if we jump right into sex. I need more time for foreplay like cuddling, teasing, and kissing. I also expressed that it would be nice if I can keep a vibrator at his place because that‚Äôs the only way I get off and I don‚Äôt want to carry it around every time I visit his place otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. And he feels like I‚Äôm demanding a lot. He even said he felt like I was nitpicking but I really wasn‚Äôt. Sex is important to me and I‚Äôve been finding it hard to enjoy it because of the way he rushes to things.

\* Deciding things for me: I expressed that I‚Äôd appreciate it if he asks my opinions first instead of deciding things for me. I want him to ask me ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre going to this bar, do you want to join us?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to XX. I assumed you wouldn‚Äôt like it. So I decided for you that you won‚Äôt join us without even asking.‚Äù

He said it feels to him that I have been the one expressing needs. He has never done that aka scheduling a time to have this sort of conversations. I mean, I love how he almost always says yes to my invites/plans (for example he said yes to a last-minute concert I wanted to watch). But I feel wronged too. Because I can tell he isn‚Äôt a people pleaser and he doesn‚Äôt struggle with expressing his needs. Every time he wants to do something he says it to me, and if it‚Äôs a no he just politely says no. So he never keeps resentments (?not sure what‚Äôs the right word, like when you did something you didn‚Äôt really want to and you felt uncomfortable/resentful about it- that kind of feeling) inside. I‚Äôm aware of my issues and have been going to therapy for me having difficulty expressing my own needs and setting boundaries, but I feel like he couldn‚Äôt understand my struggles.

Idk I‚Äôm feeling that we may just not be compatible with each other. I went through an amicable yet excruciating breakup due to incompatibility 2 years ago and it took me a long time to heal and be happy again. At this point I‚Äôm just tired and frustrated about another one. I don‚Äôt want to feel that way anymore.

He‚Äôs been a great boyfriend for me. He took really good care of me when I threw up one time and he was textbook good at calming me down when I had anxiety. A lot of things he did make me feel like oh wow that really is a green flag and I feel very loved in this relationship. But when I expressed that I have those unmet needs it led us into conflicts. I‚Äôm willing to work things out and we said we were gonna have another conversation this weekend. But I‚Äôm really anxious and stressed out about it. I really need advice on how to approach the conversation in a mature and healthy way.",Free_Narwhal7302,1,1690556413.0,1.0,4043,787,4043
"Should i move on or move out? TLDR: my next door neighbour (M20) in my (F20) dorm dumped me in a very hurtful way because he for reasons I don‚Äôt understand wants to be with his ex girlfriend (F18). How can I forgive him? Should I try to become friends with him again or just move out?

I‚Äôm a college student and I live  in a dorm with 12 other people with whom I share a kitchen. We‚Äôre all pretty close, basically roomies. Over the summer me (F20) and the guy (M20) i live next to started hooking up/dating. We kept  it  a secret from the other people in our dorm. We‚Äôre both from the same town so it was pretty easy seeing each other when we were visiting our parents. When we hung out we would go thrifting, go to the beach and flower picking, stuff i thought was date - primarily because he also called it that. Over the summer he met a lot of my friends form home and I even let him sleep over at my parents house because I really thought we were seeing each other seriously. He even asked for us to be exclusive! A week ago I picked up on something, he was acting different and texting me less. I asked him about it but he told me he was just sick.  I accepted that. Also I  didn‚Äôt want to pry.  After that we didn‚Äôt see each other for a week ish. I was certain something was up so I told him I wanted to talk about something. We agreed to talk Monday evening. 

Then Monday afternoon I was texting him and he told me he was meeting his ex girlfriend (F18)  Then later, Monday evening when I get home, I text him again. I want to talk as we agreed to do. He opens my message but doesn‚Äôt reply. So after a while I text him again. He doesn‚Äôt reply to this one either. I can hear someone‚Äôs in his room. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the ex girlfriend. Some of the people from my dorm later tell me it‚Äôs her.  He continues to ignore my texts for a couple hours, when he replies he tells me we can talk when she‚Äôs gone home. It becomes really late and texts me saying we can talk tomorrow.  I am not pleased. So I go knocking on his door. I find out she‚Äôs still in there. However, he comes out to talk.  He‚Äôs crying and tells me he misses her. We agree to talk more tomorrow, as I feel kinda bad letting her sit alone in his room. He tells me they didn‚Äôt do anything sexually. 

The next day we talk. He tries to explain himself but keep changing his explanation. First he insists we were just FWB but later he says we were dating, he‚Äôs just not sure he could fall in love with me, although he thinks I‚Äôm sweet, intelligent, pretty and great in bed. I ask him if he‚Äôs in love with his ex. He tells me no, however he still wants to be with her. She doesn‚Äôt want to be with him. I don‚Äôt understand his decision but i respect it. 

We agreed to just be friends. I want us to be. However, later that night when we were watching a movie together in his room, he said that I could lay against him if I wanted to. I didn‚Äôt.  And I‚Äôm kinda mad he even asked. I feel so used. A part of me thinks that he still wants me. However, I know that it‚Äôs naive. I‚Äôve drunk texted him a few times, asking him what‚Äôs wrong with me since he cannot fall in love. I know I‚Äôve been too much with my messages. Normally I never do that. It‚Äôs like all my pride and self worth is completely gone. I feel so desperate and pathetic. He even told me not to text him about it anymore. I‚Äôve not reached out to him since. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to me either, which makes me question if there‚Äôs even basis for a friendship when I have to take all the initiative. I think about him all the time, partly because I can hear him talking and moving around in his room from mine. 

My problem is that I cannot seem to forgive him or forget him, though I really want to. He pursued me. He asked me on a date. He allowed me to get attached to him. Then he betrayed me and tried to convince me we were just hooking up, making me feel like dirt. I feel like he‚Äôs messing with my head and it hurts so much. I  cannot stand being with him. I hate hanging out with the other people in my dorm when he‚Äôs there, I hate that i have to hide that I‚Äôm sad. My self esteem has never been lower. I really like the people in my dorm so that really sucks. However, I‚Äôm not happy living next to him. It‚Äôs very stressful for me. Therefore I‚Äôm considering moving. Should I do it if I cannot forgive him? I want to forgive him, how should I do it? Do you think we can ever be friends again?  I feel like it‚Äôs unfair I have to do all of the effort to forgive him when he‚Äôs the one who hurt me. I need advice. What would you do?",SatisfactionFuture55,1,1690556985.0,0.67,4556,913,4556

"I feel so weird going from being insecure to desirable within the dating scene I‚Äôm a 22 year old male, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, average/husky build, and a pretty average looking guy (at least to me). 

I‚Äôve been insecure my whole life. No one ever told me I was ugly or made fun of my looks or anything, I‚Äôd just constantly compare myself to other guys and get in my head tbh. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship because I always thought I was undesirable and feared ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù rejection. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I turned 21 last year lol. My insecurities deprived me of so many experiences. 

I lost my virginity on my birthday vacation, and since then I‚Äôve had a MAJOR boost in confidence. I started taking pictures more, been more outgoing, and just overall more confident in my skin, but not fully. 

I recently made a few dating app profiles, and my God, the amount of likes and matches I‚Äôve gotten is insane. I‚Äôm talking 200+ likes within a 2 weeks and an average of 2-4 matches a day.

"First time dater here, need advice. Two great dates, but I feel like im more interested. So I (m24) met this bi guy (21). I only went on 2 online dates and one semi date before, never been in a relationship. He had relations but only to women, he just made out with a guy once.


I saw him twice in a bar without talking to him. The third time I met him through friends in a park. I sparked up the conversation by asking him if we saw eachother before in that bar. He kinda hit on me and we talked for an hour, then I had to leave for work. But we did exchange numbers and set a date on the weekend. 

Date happened, it was great, spent like 13 hours in total, met some of his friends in-between. We basically befriended eachother on this date. I felt it was very romantical but I still asked him on the next day in a carefully worded message if that was a date or not, also stating I don't wanna pressure him into anything. He said yes it was, but he did not think too much about it. Which was a great answer for me, as it told me yes there is an interest but also without any pressure.

So the second date happened, also just overall great. It ended with us making out at my place and falling asleep. We were both not interested in having sex. This was the last time we met, cause he is out of town right now for a few weeks. I had plans which got cancelled so now I texted him saying I would like to visit him to which he agreed, without a set date yet.

So yea what's the catch?
1. I feel like he seems less interested than me than I am in him, even tho he did ask for the 2nd date (he did leave me the option for it not to be a date though for some reason) 
2. I just have the feeling that I am crushing very hard and I don't wanna push him away, while also doing what feels right for me.

"I‚Äôm (19) having some issues with this guy I‚Äôm seeing (24) about paying 50/50 on dates Him and I have been talking since the beginning of June. He moved here to Miami a few months ago from Spain for work. When we met in person I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him but as we‚Äôve opened up and gotten to know one another I‚Äôve grown to like him. 

He does not have a car. Ever since our first date I have been the one that picks him up and drives us to wherever we go. Now, I don‚Äôt have an issue with that but what is bothering me is how I am the one that drives 30-40 minutes to pick him up from his job and then another 20 minutes to go back to his apartment to then have to pay for parking (which is awfully expensive in Miami). I‚Äôve also been the one that has been paying for parking wherever we go out. 

And the times he‚Äôs ubered food for us while at his place, he‚Äôs made a point to buy the cheapest food he can find and has said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only paying for you because I really like you, I don‚Äôt do it for everybody‚Äù. Which absolutely rubbed me the wrong way. The times we‚Äôve gone out, he‚Äôs passed up any and every restaurant after I‚Äôve suggested we go out to eat because he doesn‚Äôt feel like paying for food so we just don‚Äôt get anything. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not being met in the middle with paying for things and it‚Äôs frustrating. I realized thats something very important to me and I needed to talk to him about it. 

Last week we went out and when we went back to his place (after I payed for mall parking, parking at his place and made the drive to pick him up from his job) I expressed that I wanted him to put more of an effort in paying for parking and have things 50/50. He said that he had cash but couldn‚Äôt zelle me anything because his bank account which is from Spain, doesn‚Äôt have zelle. He still has not made an effort to pay me half the parking for just that one time. He also doesn‚Äôt really put effort in planning our dates. He‚Äôs always asking me what we‚Äôll be doing and never takes the initiative in making plans, which is something I want him to do.

"Situationship advice Okay I will try to be as short as possible. I‚Äôm a female and I will refer to my guy as T.
Me and T met on a dating app in march. He is a very strange (in a good way) person, veryyy mysterious, an outsider. We started texting on insta like once or twice a week, nothing special. I‚Äôve always liked him a little since he is very interesting to me and I can‚Äôt seem to understand him which makes me want to know him more‚Ä¶
In the beginning of july he texts me his address and asks me to hang out (out of nowhere). I agree, we meet, first 10 minutes were very awkward, he was very nervous. We talk more, some random things and I noticed that he avoids talking about his personal life, so I don‚Äôt ask him too much. We laid on the grass, we talk, he asks to kiss me (very respectfully), I agree, we kiss. It was not an ‚ÄúI wanna f*ck you kiss‚Äù. It was actually very romantic and something I‚Äôve never felt. He held my hand all the time, kissed my forehead, played with my hair. During the date I ask him what he is looking for and he told me that he is ready for a relationship but wants to go with the flow and doesn‚Äôt wanna rush anything. He told me he is not looking for one night stands, but he used to when he was younger. He took a break from dating because he used to get very possessive.
He walks me home, everything is great until he doesn‚Äôt text me all week after the date. I texted him to ask him how is he, he sends me a video of him cooking and basically we talk like nothing happened one week ago. After that he randomly texted me about an insta story I posted days ago (he doesn‚Äôt follow me on insta, just stalks me)
Then this sunday he asked me out on a second date like 20 days after the first one. He texted me ‚ÄúI bought a hammock and I can‚Äôt wait to kiss you there‚Äù 
We go out, we kissed,laid chest to chest with each other. It was the most romantic thing I experienced. Nothing sexual happened (I told him long time ago I need time). He constantly asked me if I‚Äôm comfortable.It was just pure affection. We talked about random shit, I told him about my issues with my father and he was very understanding. He walks me home, holding my hand. Then he texts me ‚ÄúTell me how you are feeling after the date‚Äù 
The next day he texts me again out of nowhere and he recommended me a book and told me ‚Äúyou are not responsible for your dad behaviour‚Äù
That was in monday and we haven‚Äôt texted in 3 days. I‚Äôm starting to realise that Im falling in love with him and the thought of him possibly talking to other girls is killing me. Of course I can‚Äôt blame him since we are not dating. But I can‚Äôt do that ‚Äúno label ‚Äúthing.

"Finally met someone who sparks my interest after 3 years of being single - Are we moving too fast? I just turned 30 last year and have been single for the past three years. After I broke up with my Ex literally in Jan. 2020 it's been extremely hard to meet anyone who sparked my interest. I understand we had lock downs etc but I'm speaking after all that when people were going out and places were fully open overall. I had tried online dating on and off for the three years and it's been probably the most frustrating and draining experience of my entire life. I HIGHLY encourage people to use it with caution and prepare to be fucked around A LOT. For me I met a lot of girl online and even in person in town but I never clicked with anyone sadly. Intelligence is one of the key elements I look for and my god is it a dying breed. 

I was actually going to delete it again just a couple week ago when I got a match with a super cute girl. I told myself if this shit doesn't go anywhere I'm done. This girl took me by surprise and our first date we took a 2 mile walk and got caught in a down pour on the way back haha. It was kinda like a scene in a movie or something it didn't bother us at all which I thought was fun. We spent the next 3 days together which also has never happened with other girls. It's always ""I'll let you know"" ""I have to see if I'm busy"" all that type bullshit. This girl truly wanted to get to know me and the last girl that did that was my ex I met 6 years prior (Sad but true) I had some casual encounters but nobody I felt something for that was also reciprocated.  

I'm on the 4th week with this girl (28F) and we have spent a lot of time together and I have had a lot of emotions in my head more than I know what to do with. This girl has taken me by surprise at every turn. I guess I have been waiting for something to go wrong or to see if she's legit and I can honestly say she is. I'm just extremely nervous about the future since it's just been so long for me so I feel rusty. 

She asked me if I was serious about her and I didn't hesitate &lt;3

I think at some point we gave a lot of hints to each and she told me I liked this guy but wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs actually talking about me but it was a reference to something we talked about I told her I went on a couple dates which I haven‚Äôt done in a while but I told her I like this girl but for some reason I can‚Äôt tell her and wouldn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for her.

I‚Äôm a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can‚Äôt seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we‚Äôve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn‚Äôt know what to do!

She‚Äôs travelling for a year now and she said she‚Äôll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I‚Äôm extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she‚Äôs been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn‚Äôt tell her since she doesn‚Äôt want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a creep and awkward


She‚Äôs leaving now in 2 weeks. It‚Äôs been eating me from inside I want to get it off my chest. Id love for her to feel the same but if not it doesn‚Äôt really matter. But I‚Äôm really sad and feel it every night. I‚Äôve been crying for a couple days now and feel depressed and she noticed that I‚Äôm really sad.

Is it too late should I tell her, or should I let it go. I think I also wanted to make sure that I have feelings for her that‚Äôs beyond attraction She‚Äôs so sweet and I like her and don‚Äôt know why my dumbass never made a move. I was going through a lot though and haven‚Äôt seen my real family in years and been dealing with a lot school,DUI, work soulless sex and degenerate life etc..",Round_Entertainer480,1,1690900712.0,1.0,2232,454,2232
"I(23M) don't know if I got my hookup(23F) pregnant. Her communication has been terrible Yea i know, if it says negative then we should be good but I need help.

TL;DR- Hookup didn't get her period. Took 3 pregnancy test that all came back negative. She informs me that something similar has happened to her before and when it did, she found out she was 2 months pregnant. Now I'm confused on what to do since her communication is spotty.

I'm a 23 year old male still in college. I had sex with an old friend (22F), well call her Tay. Me and tay had sex on the 31st of May. Like a dumbass, I didn't use a condom.  While I don't remember fully cumming in her, I still got her a plan B. She immediately took it after sex. I was worried later that the plan b wouldn't work as she weights over 200 pounds. However, she told me she had taken plan b before and it worked. May 31st was the only time we had sex.

She texted me on July 8th and told me she never got her period (despite her telling me she was on it on June 14th when I was laying with her so idk wtf she's talking about.) But she said it had been over a month since she had her period. I told her to take a pregnancy test and she took one on the 8th of July. The test came back negative. She however then told me she was still worried, so she took 2 more pregnancy test on the 10th of July. Both came back negative.

You may think its over right? I thought so too, however, she is still worried and we had a talk. I told her that at this point its been 6 weeks since we had sex (as of july 10th). If she was pregnant the tests would more than likely show it (I know this isn't always true, but more than likely it is). I also told her that it was normal for the plan b to mess up her cycle, and make the period take longer to come. I told her at this point, she will need to go to the doctor and see what they say. This is where the problem comes in:

She then informed me that was not necessarily true. She then informs me that in the past before me, she has taken pregnancy test before and had them come back negative, AND she ended up being 2 months pregnant. She also said that her cousin has taken a plan b before and still ended up pregnant.

Im getting concerned but irritated because of many things: for 1, her communication around all of this has been really subpar. I've had to tell her to call me multiple times to get the details surrounding all of this, and she has hesitated to to that. She keeps just wanting to text. I understand she works, but this is serious and there is no excuse for us to not be able to be responsible adults and talk about this when she is off work. On top of that, I also warned her about the possibilities about the plan b not working on her, and she brushed it off to me being paranoid. Now that we are facing down the barrel of reality, it finally starts to hit her.  I really would have liked to know about her getting pregnant before, as I would then expect to understand that some times, a pregnancy test may not be 100% accurate for her. Also, I keep telling her she needs to go to the doctor soon, and she just keeps saying she'll get to it eventually. I'm like wtf is wrong with you? You aren't that damn busy for something like this. I even called around and got her a free blood pregnancy test and ultrasound appointment. I told her about it and she never responded.

She got an abortion before (Just this year. She just informed me of that too). She is familiar with the process, and said there were programs and other sources to help in the case we cannot afford one. I'm not sure if these ""sources"" will cover a second abortion for the same year.

The last time we talked was July 11th. As of July 30th, I have not heard anything from her. She has still been posting on social media, but has not said anything to me since then.

Do yall thinks she could be pregnant? What do I tell her to make her go to the doctor sooner rather than later? She said she promises to keep me updated, but how do I instill in her she needs to stay on the ball on this? Should I just drop it at this point?

Edit: So there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about how often im actually contacting this girl. To be clear, this is not a situation of me ""annoying"" this girl. She would hit me up about it/ tell me to call her. I would, and she wouldnt answer the phone. Id text her and tell her to all me back. She wouldnt get back to me until the next day. Everytime she hits me up, she asks for money. Id tell her no. If it were up to me, id probably only talk on the phone like once a week/or when she feels ready to update. But she will give me half information and straight up ghost. Then come back with information, in which during the conversation I have to keep asking for. It was getting to the point where nurse practitioners were calling me and telling me that tay needs to be sure she is calling the office, or staying in contact with me. I have not heard from her, or texted her in 3 weeks.",ConTrikster,1,1690900730.0,0.6,4995,991,4995

"Being repeatedly ghosted is having a severe impact on my mental health I'm 26f

Been ghosted multiple times (after 1 or 2 dates) despite the guys being very keen on the date and making physicl advances.

One guy particularly stung  me. He followed me on Instagram and we got chatting - turned out we knew same people and had a lot in common. We talked constantly for a week before arranging to meet. I said he could come to mine as I live right near his work. He made physical advances pretty much as soon as he saw me, kept saying how horny he was for me.  I refused to sleep with him thinking that would keep him interested. He kept saying what a great time he had had and couldnt wait to see me again. We contnued talking a few days thens suddenly ghosted and unfollowed etc. 

I'm not seeking to apportion blame-i know these guys dont owe me anything. But I'm just looking for some advice as to how I can continue dating whilst protecting myself emotionally- dont think I can withstand further rejection.

"Why are people so nasty to each other in dating? I don‚Äôt know if this is an LA thing, or dating in general but I‚Äôve been trying to get back out there and all of the women I‚Äôve met so far have been one shade or another of insufferable flake.

"Best way to ask for her number without awkwardness Hey all so good news it's been 2 months since I ditched the dating apps. I have been going to more social events like meetups and professional Networking. Women are out there I went yesterday to a young professionals meeting and saw maybe 4 or 5 women who were new and were in corner no one approached them.

"Need help. Is this an attachment style or he‚Äôs just not into me? Hello men, I come here to seek some help.
I've known this man for 6 years. However, realistically only 2 years in total in person because during those 6 years, he was away for like 4 years on and off because he's a sailor.
1 genuinely like/love him and have for all these years;
I care about him. There hasn't been a day when I didn't speak to him or let him a message even if he was away.

My only confusion is, sometimes, he'd come with intense love but other times, he'd just act like a stranger. Absolute stranger. He'd go MIA for weeks and come back. And repeat. During these years, we've travelled together. Have seen each other's best and the worst. There's understand his life in sea must be very hard. Especially so since he hates his job.

My question is, is this an attachment style or he just doesn't like me at all. I'm confused.

"I pushed someone away About 9 months ago I was fresh out of a seriously draining relationship. There was a lot of drama and it was definitely toxic. I've gone through a lot of therapy to get over it. I met this guy at a concert and didn't expect to get into something so soon but it just happened. He treated me really well even though he was kind of overbearing and got ahead of himself. He was immature and moved insanely quick. I got scared and pushed him away because I wasn't ready to move so quick even though I really liked him. He was crushed.

My ex saw him at a party a few months after that and then my ex messaged me saying he told him the reason I pushed him away was because I was still messing with him. I told him that was really messed up he lied to him and to leave him and me alone but I never messaged the guy I had pushed away about it to tell him that's not true.

Fast forward to now. I am feeling healed and ready for a healthy relationship. My first thought went to this guy. I went to follow him on Instagram since I didn't have an Instagram before and he immediately blocked me. I made a burner account and saw that he just recently got in a relationship. I'm crushed. There's so much I wanted to say and clarify and I hate the way it all ended. I truly think it was the right person wrong time, and now I'm too late.

"Opinions please‚Ä¶ Hi all,

So I met a girl a few weeks ago at a party and we hit it off straight away. Chemistry was all there and spent all night together. She insisted to get my number from me before she got into a taxi home.

Later I decide to follow up and ask her out. She ignored the request and replied with how late it was and getting home with it being light already.
I left this and she later replied again to say that she was busy all weekend and ‚Äòmaybe next week‚Äô

So I left it for half a day and then offered the Tuesday. 
I then get a reply saying she is not looking to date and her head isn‚Äôt in the right place but could still meet up sometime. The next day I was out in town and happened to see her with another guy‚Ä¶ I immediately knew what this looked like. 

A few days of us not talking, she offers to meet for a coffee on the weekend. I accept.
The next day I get another message asking if I wanted to join her to a party the day before the coffee. I also accept this and go with zero expectations.

This time it‚Äôs even better or so I thought‚Ä¶.
She admitted to me about her head being all over the place but a few weeks ago decided to date a guy from a dating app but realised she actually liked him after 3 dates. 
As the conversation progressed she leaned in to kiss me and we did.. mostly all night. Saying how good the chemistry is etc and she said she didn‚Äôt expect it to go this well with me. 

I explained my position of not wanting to be involved unless I date her and not after casual.(learnt my lessons)

Before she dropped me off (she didn‚Äôt drink at all)  - she said‚Ä¶ We can sleep together and it may or may not lead to us dating.
I said no to this but she insisted I think about it and she will think about her situation on dating.

She also decides coffee the next day isn‚Äôt such a good idea but her words ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a no like that it‚Äôs just I need to think‚Äù 
‚ÄúNot saying no in the future‚Äù

She goes cold with me the next day.
The following day I take a last ditch shot and ask to meet-up.
I am then greeted with a ‚Äúmy situation has changed and I am looking to date and see where it leads‚Äù (with the other guy).

I‚Äôve replied and said I understand and to take care. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a rebound or what. 

She then said ‚Äúwe have great chemistry and I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not something we can explore right now‚Äù.

Wtf?! 

I know the right thing is to move on and not look back but ffs the chemistry was off the charts. Anyone at both events commented that we either looked a couple or should be.

"I was abused raped then ghosted by somone I love...how do I move on So it's a bit I'd an complex siatiatuon plz dont judge I just need support on how to get over him. So I was seeing somone else for about a month or so and alot happened he was abit absuive you could say? Well my family seems to think so and they think technically he assaulted me? As I told him I disnt want to have sex and espailly unprotected sex but he did pushed it while I was not sober. After that he made me deal with a possible pregnancy and miscarriage all by myself not even giving me a hug or allowing me to doke over during this time. He also barely texts me and ignores half my messages as we were just still just hanging out and not anything yet. 

After this I decided we are done and went on tinder to talk to other mature ppl idk what I was expecting a distraction I guesse. I was just talking to many ppl at once tondiatract myself. But one really stood out eventually I began talking to him eveeyday and our connection because intense we hadn't met yet but it was pretty romantic and both of said we never met or connected like this online before. I know it sounds silly maybe it wasnt real love but it was the begining stage it was more than flitting it was like we were in a realtionship we spoke about everything including trauma and suicide I really opened up and idk how bad his trauma was  ju he shared ally of family issues he had. At that point its more than just flirting the bond we built maybe wasnt so serious but I'd say equivalent to dating somome for a month atleast. Anyway this was happening at the same time I was dealing with previous guy as I matched with this new one just a few days after ending things. I was espially assaulted and showing all sorts of signs of possible pregnancy and misscarraige and maybe STI's? Ofc I couldn't talk to the new guy about this I had nobody to talk to about it after the possible miscarriage I reached out to the old guy and said I need to talk to him about wjat is going on to figure out what to do and I need suport which was a mistake as he is abusive and gave very limited suport if any. He made me feel worse the next day I went to the doctor to test for STIs and I just went to a clinic where they just are understaffed I guesse and pushed me out after a few questions (I guesse they did technically do what had to be done...but I felt they disnt take their time with me) I had more questions but they sidnt have time and just lost it after all this abuse. I know now ita stupid bit I went to the new guy for emotional support I told him everything of how I had unprotected sex and I might have possible Sti I want to get tested before starting anything qne the doctor made me feel worse. I even gave him a chance to say I understand if he doesny like me anymore. He just unmatched and blocked and ghosted. He is usually so supportive I was shocked.  I know that is alot or info I cant expect him to stick around but i thought at the least he would say I'm sorry about ur situation....I told him I got into an argument with my abuaive parents which lead me to go see that guy and not be sober and I was taken advantage of while not sober....so I thought  he would atleast say I'm sorry for what you went through but I need to put me first or I dont feel comfotable I hope you feel better but I cant continue. He just ghosted when I was  vulnerable and I know I know this alot to unload but I just thought atleast a simple "" I'm sorry to hear that but I am not interested take care of yourself bye "" he kept saying he wants to marry me lowkey and have his kids to which I said stop idk if I want marraige and he said I know i cant help how pwegwct you are I want to lock you down and make you mine forever. He also supported me emotionally when I was depressed. I know its alot to hear about stis but ghosting is so cowardly. By no means is he a bad guy but I think it shows he doesnt respect care or ""love"" me as much as I thought he did. Maybe he isnt all I thought he was in my head. He didnt know all the details but he knew I was with somone elses pretty recently which is one of the reasons I thought it was ok to tell him I wanted to get tested first?  I thought we would just wait till I get tested? Again its alot of info for sure he isnt q bad guy but maybe not the one if he is gonna abandon me like that without even a I'm sorry I cant do this.  Looking back out convos where not surfacey but the reason I feel for him is just because he treated me decent/respect well he did treat me well but I mean like he treated me like human which is something I'm not used to as I keep getting abused over and over again in my life. So maybe I'll find somone else who treats me decent too :/ idk I liked him I know its mostly my fault how do I get over him?",spoiledcandy,1,1690542618.0,1.0,4807,976,4807

Online dating and IRL hybrid concept So I'm thinking about having a bunch of business cards with a basic online dating profile description printed on them with a Google phone number. I even might make one of those free websites and create a dating profile and have a QR code on the card that links to it. Then I could just go around and hand them out to any girl who I find attractive. As a girl would this completely weird you out or would you be intrigued? I figure it would be cheaper than a membership for a dating site and it would reach some girls who might not be into the whole online dating scene.,RavenousFox1985,1,1690523186.0,1.0,606,117,606
"Broke Birthday Ideas for my Boyfriend of 1 Year? Hello all! I‚Äôm a bit embarrassed to be putting myself out there like this, but if it means I can get some inspiration for gift/activity of ideas for my significant other, then I‚Äôm all for it. It‚Äôs my boyfriends 29th  birthday in a few days, and we are going through a rough patch right now (more on that in a minute). Basically we‚Äôre flat broke, and I want to make his birthday as special as I can on a limited budget. I know he will be more than happy just to spend the day with me, but I also know from lurking on the site that Reddit can be a gold mine for ideas, especially for situations like this!

A little bit of backstory, for those interested: I met my boyfriend about a year ago. I had ended an abusive relationship about a year prior that was very toxic and unhealthy, and was apprehensive about going back into the dating scene. However, this guy really charmed the socks off me from the start, and while we took it slow in the beginning, he has really gone the distance to show me what being treated with respect and care feels like. Basically, without wanting to go on a spiel or be cheesy, he shows me what being special feels like, and I love to show it back in any big or little way that I can. For my birthday last year, he took me out to dinner, and got me a nice outfit, and a beautiful necklace. And a lovely card with a heartfelt note penned inside. It‚Äôs been years since I did anything special for my birthday, and I think he inferred as much, so he really went all out for me and the whole gesture just meant so much to me. Fast forward a few months and we‚Äôve hit a rough patch, and by that I mean we‚Äôre staying in his car right now, and working odd jobs to get by until we find something more stable. So the Tres Leches cake I wanted to make for him, and the other more expensive gift ideas, will have to wait until next year. 

I want to make it perfectly clear that I am under no pressure or obligation from him to buy or do something for his birthday, and when I asked if there was any activity he had in mind for the day, he simply wanted to spend the day with me. This is my own desire to have a special day for him, for the reasons I described above. So, does anyone have any creative budget gift or activity ideas? I was was thinking maybe a coupon book, you know for ‚Äúfree backrubs‚Äù or ‚Äúhead whenever you want‚Äù but A) it‚Äôs really hard to give a backrub in the car and B) the second idea is already something that‚Äôs taken care of regularly, so it seems kind of lame to give coupons for it‚Ä¶ 

Anyway, I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Thanks very much in advance if you took the time to read and comment! I know I‚Äôll be able to make him smile no matter what. üôÇ",rosalie_vellaveros,1,1690503169.0,1.0,2732,537,2732

"My unexpectedly casual fling with Mrs. Right I am (21m), and she is (19f). For context, I met this girl on Tinder a week prior, and this was our first time meeting. I pulled up to her house, and I grabbed the door of my passenger seat for her as we greeted each other. We proceeded to my friend's place for a kickback. After a little bit of icebreakers and a couple drinks (she doesn't drink), we sat down with my friends and played some games for a while. Slowly, the party died down, and my friend who owns the house headed to bed while she and I watched some random ass movie. At this point, I want to mention that she said she didn't want to have sex on a first date, to which I replied, That's completely fine. What was soon to ensue was the complete opposite of that. What started as me lying on her stomach soon turned into me putting my hand around her throat and kissing her lips. We ended up making out, and although I'm not the best kisser, I managed to keep up the heat and then trail off to kiss down her neck to her collar bone. From there, I continued the foreplay and soon got the okay to slide my fingers inside. After a bit of clitoral play and some added pressure from inside, she came. At this point, I was done, honestly. I respected what she said before, but then she hit me with ""I want you inside me""! I was surprised but cautious still. I proceeded to ask her two more times just to make sure she was sure this was something she really wanted. She responded with a breathy ""yes"". So I proceeded to pull out my cock, and I could see a surprised look on her face as she looked at it. At this point, this beautiful girl has me absolutely falling for her, and not just because of the situation I am currently in but because everything about her, from her personality to her looks, is so dorky and hot at the same time. I slid inside, and this was quite an experience because I've never felt such wetness before. Although I hadn't gone all the way in, I could see her eyes roll back through a slit in between her eyelids. After about 30 minutes, she was worn out, and I hadn't finished, although it felt amazing. She asked if there was something wrong, and I explained that it takes me a while to finish, and she was slightly upset that she couldn't return the favor. I assured her that she felt great and that it was just me. I must have flicked a switch because she was ready to go again, and she decided to take control by getting on top. After another 20‚Äì30 minutes of hot breath and sweat, I finished inside her. This was a first-time experience for me, so I was just more attracted at this point. After a while of just kissing while she sat on top, we cleaned up and laid down for the night.
~
A day later, after some texting about what we wanted in life and other things of that nature, we decided to hang out at my place and play board games with some music in the background. She also mentioned that she didn't just want to have sex when she came over, and I agreed. After hanging out for a while and talking a little bit more about our past relationships, We realized that we were very similar. I felt like we were connecting way more than we already had the previous night. After we ate, we crawled into bed. Once again, we started to make out, and I continued to please her with foreplay. After that, she once again asked for it, and when she did, I immediately made her confirm rather than jump on the opportunity. She replied, ""Give me that dick"". I could tell this was more aggressive than last time, so I told her to turn and bend over. She did it immediately after I commanded it, with no fuss. It was almost like she knew that I love when women are submissive. We went at it for 30 minutes, and she told me she was tired and couldn't take it any longer. I kissed her forehead and said that it was fine and that I appreciated her effort. We laid down for about an hour, and she started to grind on me. It only took me a couple seconds to get back up to full size, and she immediately Put it back in and pushed back against me as I stroked deep. Soon after, I was filling her up. This was just an amazing feeling. We cleaned up, and in the morning she went to work.
~
We texted through the following day, and her responses started to change. I noticed something was wrong, and I asked her, but she just said it was nothing. Obviously, this meant that it was something. I just didn't want to pry and ruin our relationship. Soon after, I was faced with a response to my question, ""Do you still want to hang out?"" Her response was ""Idk."" I was so hurt that I blocked her and began writing the perfect message to convey my feelings to her. Although I was putting my pride at risk, I had felt that I loved this woman more than my previous 3-year relationship. We had shared that we wanted kids together and to get married. It all just stopped so suddenly, and I needed to explain myself even if she didn't care because it was for me, honestly. I sent her that message two days later.",Successful_Ebb_1662,1,1690501448.0,0.67,5014,970,5014

"Can I believe my boyfriend that he is fine with us waiting to have sex? I (20F) have been with my bf (21M) for 5 months. I'm a virgin and the idea of sex freaks me out for numerous reasons, so we haven't done anything yet. As weeks go by, I get more and more scared he will dump me because he's not getting laid. 

I tried to remedy this by deliberately getting blackout drunk before having sex last Saturday (I sneaked a tequilla bottle in my bag and drank it in one shot in the bathroom). He was very displeased with that though, refused to have sex and drove me home; he's been lowkey angry with me since. 

Today we had a conversation about it and I admitted I do not feel ready for sex rn, even though I will try to get ready in the next couple months. I made up a story about still being affected by purity culture, which sounded completely plausible since I come from an immigrant family (the real reasons paint me as insecure and somewhat insane, there is no way in hell he ever finds out about them). He reassured me, said that's not a problem and that even though he would obviously like to have sex with me he doesn't mind waiting some more until I feel ready. 

The problem is, I don't believe him. I can't shake the feeling he only says that bc that's what I want to hear and it is just as true as my purity culture sob story. He's a 21 year old healthy guy, he obviously has to have sexual needs that require satisfaction. It would be naive to expect him to hang around when he could go on Tinder and get a hot girl to sleep with him within an hour. I fear he's secretely resenting me for not putting out, that he'll end up dumping me if I don't become ready to have sex soon enough and the entire thing drives me even more anxious. How can I get proof that he's genuine? Everything I manage to think of could backfire tremendously (like for example getting a friend to try to seduce him).",throwaway12856439,1,1690526415.0,0.57,1903,369,1903

"How should I (24M) approach DM‚Äôing this girl (23F) I‚Äôm interested in? Hi everyone,

After the most difficult past year of my life, I‚Äôve finally come to terms (and worked through) all that has happened, and am moving forward. This includes revisiting my (admittedly dry) dating live that I stepped away from. Before, I was in a download/delete cycle, but told myself that whenever I revisit dating, I‚Äôd try and do it off the apps. Either in person or dming people I‚Äôve been interested in for a while. Granted this last one is still via app, but I suppose different because it seems more ‚Äúreal‚Äù (idk how to describe it lol).

Anyways, there‚Äôs this girl I followed on IG earlier this year in March. Same hometown, she‚Äôs friends with a really close cousin (that‚Äôs like a sister), have other mutuals, live in same city now, went to same place for undergrad, and from similar diaspora communities. I think she‚Äôs really cute and finally have the courage to initiate things. However, she doesn‚Äôt post photos/stories too often. What she posts on her stories isn‚Äôt really conducive (in my opinion) to starting a convo; related to some company she works/associates with and I never knew how to try and engage with it (ie, don‚Äôt want to shoehorn into shitty conversation lol). 

Until earlier this week, she posted a story of food she was eating with a friend and I liked the story. Things are getting pretty serious (jk haha). I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd continue from here? Besides liking/trying to respond to such stories that aren‚Äôt related to that one company (because idk wtf I‚Äôd say). Some people have suggested messaging her just saying hey (others said to say I was thinking about her, but that‚Äôs just weird imo). I have a tendency to overthink + an autistic, so a lethal combo lmao. What do y‚Äôall think? She always views my stories and liked my photo that I uploaded a few weeks ago. I posted one story 2 days after she saw, but didn‚Äôt like. Again, this doesn‚Äôt mean anything, but just wanted to give some background. This is already getting long lol. What do y‚Äôall think?

"How can I stop thinking about a guy? So I reconnected with an old friend a few months ago and I've had slight feelings for him, but not much where it's impacted me.

"The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband... For purposes of this story, my ex's name is Hannah, her husband is Jeremy and her sister is Amanda (all fake names).
Hannah and I started dating in our senior year of high school. It was great, but lasted about 6 months and ended things about a month before graduation. We kept in scarce contact until about the end of the year when I moved out of state. We didn't talk at all for a couple of years but I knew she had started dating and ultimately married another guy from my facebook feed. When I moved back to our home state, I randomly got a message from Hannah asking if I still liked the same type of stuff. I said I did, and she replied that she knew a girl, Amanda, that ""would be perfect for me"" and offered to go on a double date. I said ok and then she said that it is her sister-in-law. I feel incredibly awkward at this point (I was 21 and not the best in awkward situations) because I already agreed but would rather not go out with her SIL, I had thought it was going to be a friend or something.
So the day of the date comes and I meet Jeremy, Hannah, and Amanda to go see some Christmas lights. Jeremy and Hannah walk off and I'm left alone with Amanda which was the ""best"" part of the date, only because that's when I was the least awkward, but they come back and spend most of the date with Amanda and I. It wasn't a great date by any means (mostly due to me). I felt like I couldn't talk to Amanda with them there. Jeremy and I didn't have anything in common that I could glean from the conversations that I had heard whilst on the date, and I felt like I couldn't talk with Hannah (even though I had no feelings for her at this point, being married and all. I just got along with her best) because that would probably just upset Jeremy and Amanda. Then Hannah and Jeremy offer for everyone to come back to their place for hot chocolate any more conversation, and me being me, agree to go over. More awkwardness ensues and after a bit, I say I better get going and leave for home and finally get to unwind from that shitstorm of awkwardness that just engulfed me those last few hours.
So, yeah, that's the story of how I went on a blind double-date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband (and in case it isn't clear; husband and SIL are siblings).
P.S. During the time we were dating, I knew that Hannah's parents were divorced and she lived with her mom 100%. What I didn't know until after the date was that Jeremy had also lived with a single parent (his dad) and that Hannah and Jeremy's parents married each other (after Hannah and Jeremy were married, not before).
P.P.S. So I guess, technically, I should have titled this: The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL/step-sister, my ex, and her husband/step-brother. LOL tricky stuff...",TForestR1012,1,1690495417.0,1.0,2859,550,2859
"I (19M) am considered a fairly attractive man but women act as if they‚Äôre scared of me I try and talk with girls at the gym, school, clubs, rarely at the mall and I usually get told ‚ÄúSorry I have a boyfriend!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lesbian‚Äù.

To describe myself I‚Äôm ripped, have nice face/hair, dress well, decent confidence and great hygiene. When I look in the mirror I think I look amazing and would totally date me, but then I go out in public and most of the time this loneliness has reminded me why I might die alone without ever having experienced the dating life other guys my age do.

"Have to stop doing my salsa classes... So I recently took up salsa dancing, I tried one class initially because I heard that a lot of women did it, but found myself enjoying it and over the last few weeks I just focused more on dancing rather than dating.

I got pretty acquainted with the people in the class, especially with these two women who are friends who have done these classes for longer than I have: we will call them A &amp; B.

A &amp; B would always try to talk to me during partnered lessons, and volunteered to dance with me at a salsa social event last month. 

I decided to ask A for her number and we met up the next day for a walk and talk, did our own dancing lesson in the park and made out. 

Next week A was friendlier to me but B was suddenly very distant and cold. The two were not talking to each other. I went to another lesson that week and when I tried to talk to B, she made a passive aggressive comment (can't remember it). 

The next week I went to class, I saw A &amp; B arguing over something before it started, then they kept distance from each other. I asked A what was wrong and she just said that ""B was just stirring drama over nothing"".

Later that week both A &amp; B suddenly went cold to me at class. A wasn't returning my texts. After class the teacher made a ""disclaimer"" about students dating each other and about ""being respectful"". The teacher then spoke to me after class to say that ""he didn't think the lessons were working out"".

I was confused and upset but before I left, another women, we'll call her C, approached me and let me know that A &amp; B talked about me to the other women and notified me that the same thing happened with another guy who had previously done these classes. 

Apparently that guy dated both A &amp; B and they had issues with each other but then ""took it out on the guy"" and discredited him.

What was going on here? I still have a few weeks left of these classes I paid for, do I keep going or just go to another school?",2guyshangingoutnaked,1,1690527788.0,1.0,2004,388,2004

"My fourth date‚Äî‚Äîabout my dating experience on a herpes dating site Online dating can be a rather exciting, albeit sometimes awkward, journey. I had tried the typical avenues: Tinder, OkCupid, Match, but it wasn‚Äôt until my journey took a twist and led me to a rather unique platform, a herpes dating site, that I had this experence in my memory.

Herpes dating sites are designed to provide a safe platform for people who have herpes. It‚Äôs a place where they don‚Äôt have to fret over the ‚Äòbig reveal‚Äô and where they could meet people who understand their condition. Stepping into the platform was a bit intimidating at first, but the supportive community genuinely eased my anxieties.

It was during this period that I crossed paths with Jenna, and she is my forth date.

Jenna had an effusive sparkle in her eyes - something that could lift anyone‚Äôs spirits. Our conversations were intriguing and emotive, and our first three dates had flown by effortlessly, filled with laughter, shared secrets, and a sense of familiarity.

For our fourth date, we decided on something we hadn‚Äôt attempted before - a hiking trip to a nearby nature reserve. The decision sprung from a shared longing for the tranquil outdoors, a break from our city-bound routines - a little adventure, if you will.

The day started with a hearty breakfast at a charming caf√©, complete with lively chatter and infectious laughter. Following which, we embarked on our journey towards the nature reserve, the butterflies in our stomachs hinting at the adventure that awaited us.

The thing about hiking is that it‚Äôs a struggle wrapped in magnificent views. We huffed and puffed, and laughed at our shared struggle. Together we traversed through thick trees and muddy terrains, with the only sounds being our footsteps, our hearty laughter, and the hymn of nature around us.

Near the top of the trail, we found a secluded spot overlooking the picturesque scenery beneath us. The place was quiet, serene, with only our soft breaths disturbing the peace. Sitting there, she opened up about her experiences with herpes - the fear, the anger, the acceptance, and finally, the understanding that it did not define her. I admired her strength and reciprocated with my own tale of reckoning.

What made this date different was not the stunning vistas or the adrenaline-rush from the hike, but the raw emotions and shared vulnerability. It was a firm reassurance that this platform had achieved its goal: to connect, to resonate, and to provide companionship beyond the stigma of herpes.

We walked back when dusk fell, the lulling voices of nature guiding our path. That night, surrounded by desolate beauty, we grew closer in understanding and empathy.

The experience that unfolded that night only strengthened our bond, highlighting the importance of understanding, empathy, and genuine acceptance beyond the imperfections. It taught me that love and intimacy transcend physical conditions, and what truly matters is the emotional connection between two people.",N111ko_for_dating,1,1690505627.0,1.0,3021,495,3021

"How should I (M26) approach reconnecting with my ex (F21) after a toxic breakup, considering the timing, distance, and past issues, while focusing on personal growth and respecting her need for space? I am in a MD/MBA student in US. She is in one of the best engineering programs in Girona.  
So the last thing I heard from my ex is that:

1. She doesn't know if she loves me anymore
2. She doesn't want to make any decisions about us as she's going to China for study abroad for the summer.
3. She wants space and no contact
4. She made it clear that she can't do a Long Distance Closed Relationship

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up in December of last year. A lot of toxicity on my part. The breaking point was someone who failed medical school sent me a voice note of my ""ex cheating"" and I confronted her about it. She broke down crying cuz I didnt believe her with this ""clear evidence"". Literally like two weeks ago, this dude admitted that it was him. I cant believe it. This is such weird and high school like shit but medical school is like that. A bunch of weirdos. They do anything so that you fail or to distract your peace and she mentioned that it was him so I tripled fucked up. Completely fucked up.

  
What an asshat. A jealous pr\*\*\*  
Anyway, thats my loss.

  
I am looking to move on. I tried having casual sex and didnt like it. I've been in therapy which has been good for me mentally. I've cut ties with these fake friends and only depend on really good friends of mine. I accept to give her space and tons of it. I might not speak to her again. I also dont know what to do with this dude who did this shit. Im at a lot of words that he would do something like this knowing how much I liked this person. Claimed to do it for my own good ""long distance relationships are fake and she will cheat"" I still have no idea how to address this, this is absurd.

  
Anyway, back to the question:

  
I may have opportunities to visit more often. Weeks/months at time even. Making very good money while still saving on housing and etc. and while im in school definitely twice a semester. This is something that I will do for her cuz my life is better with her.

  
The distance and my toxicity, and the baggage of jealous friends I think I can fix and work on. I'll continue therapy and etc.

  
So here is where I need advice. Since right now, I dont have the means to see her I wont bother her. Ill maintain space.  
If my situation changes, which it could very well. And I have the finances and time to see her, I wonder if reaching out would be appropriate.

1. My dad suggested I waited until 2 years when we both are done with school. This would allow us to make actual adult decision as the distance doesn't work for either of us.
2. We broke up in December so I dont know if giving it a year would be best or give it like a year since we met in person. Which was late September.
3. Just give up lol.  


My plan, if I decide to reach out, would be to ask if she'd like to meet up for coffee and have a face-to-face conversation instead of relying on Facetime or texts. I believe that being in person might show that things can be different and more meaningful.

  
Additionally, I'm not sure if I should bring up the false cheating claim made by a friend. It's a strange situation, and I don't want to create unnecessary drama.  
For now, I'm prioritizing my personal growth and healing, whether we reconcile or not. If we do decide to give it another shot, I want to do it with a healthier mindset.

  
TL;DR: After a breakup caused by my own toxic behavior and a friend's false cheating claim, I'm considering reconnecting with my ex when I can visit her more. Unsure about timing and how to broach past issues, I'm focusing on personal growth and respecting her wish for distance. Need advice.",Esquito,1,1690879079.0,1.0,3815,720,3815

"Incompatible finances, compatible everything else I (26F) just entered a new relationship and I‚Äôm staring to feel that our difference in finances will be our downfall.

He (27M) is working full-time and rents a decently sized apartment in our major US city. He can take care of his basic needs but doesn‚Äôt have much leftover to spend on dates, gifts, or sweet gestures. I make high 6-figures and have been increasing my income rapidly for the last two years. I own my townhouse and have a good sum left to put towards investments and savings after paying my bills.

Prior to entering this relationship, we had a discussion of what a perfect relationship would look like. I stressed that being taken care of is important to me, and while I do not need to rely on a man for support, I prefer it. He said something along similar lines of being a provider. 

Great, our relationship values align. We‚Äôre amazing together in bed. Our personalities mesh well. However, I have yet to see any action or ambition towards becoming a provider. He‚Äôs working on gaining more experience to work up the ladder at his company, but it could be years before he‚Äôs able to live comfortably (or what I would consider comfortable). 

I love flashy dates, nice vacations, mutual spoiling and I can‚Äôt see myself doing that in the near future. I adore him and spending time getting closer‚Ä¶ but I have this terrible thought that I will soon resent our financial circumstances.

"How to invite a girl out after meeting her Hello Redditors. I met this really charming girl at a festival this weekend. I usually dont have it in me to talk to many girls, but i couldnt let this one get away. We smalltalked a bit and ended up dancing a while before she went to her again. I didnt feel like it was appropriate to ask her out there and then. I  also met her the day after, where basically the same thing happened. Some small talk and dancing, for her to go back go her friends. I should have probably asked her out then.

I did however take the chance and asked to follow her and instagram, which she accepted and asked me back. Therefore i was wondering of sending her a text. I was thinking of something like ""Hi! I really enjoyed meeting you and dancing with you this weekend despite my bad efforts. Are you back at work or are you still on vacation?"". The bad effort dancing was a thing we small talked about.

Does this message seem okay or is there something i can do better?",Immediate_Rub4506,1,1690878218.0,1.0,996,192,996

"What does it mean when a guy checks your LinkedIn multiple times? I'm asking for a friend. The situation is that she has been working on a school assignment with this guy. They had an almost 4 hour phone call to work on this assignment together. Shortly after she ended the call at the agreed time, she gets a notification that someone viewed her LinkedIn, which turned out to be the guy she was on a call with. 

As a bit of a background, I heard through the grapevine that this guy was dating a girl back in Oct 2022, but he has never brought up his girlfiend in conversation. My friend and this guy don't follow each other on social media, but they contact each other through a WhatsApp group chat. Her WhatsApp account initially didn't have a profile picture, but now she has a profile picture of herself. They both have worked on other assignments before and he had viewed her LinkedIn a few times before this incident. Each time, he views her LinkedIn after their phone call. He is also aware of my friend's career path through some small talk they've made over time. My friend and I find it odd that he viewed her LinkedIn multiple times.

"Would you date someone that didn‚Äôt have a car? So is a grown adult not owning a car a deal breaker? I F(25) have been dating M(33) for about 4 months now. Just for context, we have been best friends for a long time, but didn‚Äôt talk for about a year or two due to my past ex 7 year relationship. I love the guy I am with and am incredibly happy. He treats me like a queen but he does not have a car and that honestly turns me off a bit. It didn‚Äôt bother me at first, but I figured he would eventually work towards that or had some desire to drive again. He used to have a license until he was in his mid twenties. He  had a hard time in his early twenties before I met him and couldn‚Äôt afford insurance and car payments so he just sold the car &amp; stopped driving. Now since it‚Äôs been so long since he drove he would have to retake the drivers test, pay for car registration, pay for car insurance, gas, and car payments. He claims it makes more sense for him to Uber because he works walking distance from where he lives and that its cheaper to Uber than paying for everything involved to own a vehicle. I expressed to him how I see a future with him but I need some security. If I was ever sick, couldn‚Äôt drive, or if we had children I would want him to have a car and be there for me. Not to mention you can‚Äôt always rely on Uber, we live in suburbs in dfw and we get crazy weather so Uber isn‚Äôt always readily available. I don‚Äôt want it to feel like I‚Äôm driving my child around everywhere when he‚Äôs 8 years older than me.

"Me (30M) and GF (30F) broke up. Now seeing 31F). TL;DR: Honestly didn't think I'd come here for advice but my mind is twisted and I don't know how to act on this.

Me and my gf broke up after 5 years. I don't really want to go into detail about her because this isn't about her.

I met this girl through work. We rarely see each other at work and we both like to keep it that way just so there isn't any complications. We hung out a couple times outside of work. 1st was dinner and 2nd was an activity day and from what I assume, she loved it. It was a perfect day. And she wants to hang out again.

Throughout us talking for the past month or so, we would both get to know each other. In our conversations, I would drop the first flirting hint and she dropped one immediately back at me. She compliments my eyes and my work attire and I told her she's gorgeous no matter what she's wearing. Then she told me I made her blush.

Seems like every convo we have, we're laughing and having a good time. She asks me all these questions about my life. Interests family hobbies things like that. Go into detail about it. Most people wouldn't really want to know about. We seem to have a lot in common as well as far as personal goals. Love for animals. Same taste in music. We were talking about movies and Barbie (don't ask why) but then she says. I can be Ken and she'll be Barbie. Stupid I know but It's just a vibe when I hang out with her.

She has a daughter and I'm not deterred by that. I'm usually good with kids. And I've showed I'm interested in knowing more about her daughter and taking her up on her offer of having my niece and her daughter hang out.

When we last hung out. I walked her to her car and told her how I felt. That I'm attracted to her. I didn't really ask her for her feelings and she didn't give them out either. I hugged her. We held each others hands and then she came in and hugged me one more time.

Told her that I have plans and have a appointment and will go to cinema. Then she asked if I could text her how the movie was. Told her that I stil don't have her number and that never texted.

"Not fully sure where people(women) my age tend to hang out.  For context I'm 28M. I live in SWFL. I've been rolling solo since for a whole now.  One of the biggest struggle I've had since moving here 7 years ago is the amount of older folk in the area vs  anyone who's somewhat close to my age.    I'm still just at a lost on where to I should be hanging out to have a better chance at stumbling across  those who seem my age.   I would say most the people are 45+. And most being around that retirement age.  I dont think I've had a proper random conversation  with anyone under the age of 40 so far this year(  work not included).  

 I am the introverted type who  doesnt always know what to do to open up more. I've never step foot into a crowded bar or club. As I struggle with loud music/lights/bumping into people and so I do ussally make a point to even try on like a friday or Saturday  night( work nights any way)   I do get sundays for free time but everywhere I kinda go is chill but always just filled with older folks. You know when I have the free time. 

Am I just being dumb about the situations?. I am on the spectrum  so I know  I can be pretty naive  about basic things at times. I just dont even know what people around my age are even doing or are into  that's around my age.   Find places where it mainly 20s and 30s flusters me.  I only seem to see children,teen,parents and older folks but cant seem to pick out people my age.   

  Just for context  meetup.com had over 10 active options for people 45+   the only active 20s,30s group is  a over an hour drive because it's for a different area altogether.  The closest mall that isnt dead is 45 mins, beaches alere an hour or 2 depending.  Semi rural

"Trying to meet this girl, but she is giving mixed signals I'm 25 male, had this breakup 6 months ago. Months ago I noticed this girl exchanging glances with me at the gym, but everytime we look at each other, she tends to look away. I think she is so so so attractive, but didn't felt ready to engage at friendship or anything else cause I was dealing with the breakup. Now I feel so much better and ready to try meet new people and she's top 1 in my mind right now, but we barely chit chat on elevator last week and take turns lifting. Few days after, in gym again, we saw each other while I was leaving and she was entering. I tried to look at her and say something but she pretend she didn't see me (we were very close). Now, when at gym, I avoid to look at her cause I don't want her to feel uncomfortable. But I really do think she is a shy person, and this could explain why she does look away sometimes, as when we did chat, she seemed at least interested. I'm confused cause I don't want to miss the chance to get to know her (for a friendship at least), but I don't want her to feel awkward as well and she is giving mixed signals (in my opinion).

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting.

Now I did this fairly often with you. I'd catch myself staring at you. And need to breathe deeply, quietly. I know there were times it was an uncontrolled, almost audible deep breath. As I'd catch myself lusting deeply. 

But that moment. The way your hair laid. The look on your face. The light beard. And... just you.

He told me after that he thought it was really chill and that we got along great. He also mentioned wanting to hang out again.We vaguely made plans again but when I texted him that day he suddenly couldn't make it anymore. Which was annoying but I thought okay whatever, he probably forgot and was busy. He's also kinda dry through text and doesn't reply quickly, he said that he doesn't like talking through text and is never on his phone so I was like okay yeah i get that. Now I wanted to ask him if he wanted to go do something but i'm still waiting for a reply to a different text from two days ago.I feel stupid for putting in effort to talk and make plans when I get nothing in return. But he told me that i'm his type and that he thinks i'm chill. So yeah idk if he's just a horrible texter or is not interested and is just playing with me.",-oh_,1,1690489137.0,1.0,1044,209,1044
"I (M26) Like This Girl (F23) I Work With But I Barely Know Her. I Now Want To Try To Message Her And See What Happens. What Should I Say? I'm a supermarket delivery driver and this colleague also works in the warehouse behind the store but is a picker and sorter.

She's very good looking and I've always fancied her, however we've had very little interaction in the two years that I've been there. She would smile at me if we made eye contact and had the occasional verbal exchange but really that's it. In fact, in all that time I never even caught her name until a couple of weeks ago when I overheard another colleague call her by it and I then found her on Facebook (she accepted my friend request).

Given that I'm out most of the day, I don't see her very often anyway and we have rarely if ever had a real opportunity to stop and chat. It hasn't helped that there were sometimes periods of weeks and even months when I didn't see her at all. However, now I finally have the means to contact her on social media, I thought maybe it might be nice to message her and try to get to know her a little more, possibly ask her out. What could I say though? And how could I build up to it? Thanks for any advice!",dalekguy97,1,1690488639.0,1.0,1211,237,1211
"Tinder date of 3 months - need advice Hey there reddit! 

So I need some advice, sorry in advance for the long post.

Like I never did the dating thing properly before and I don't really know the dos and donts, especially if it comes to American dating habits. 

So a little background. We matched about 3 months ago on Tinder. He (33/Texan) and me (33f/German).

Apparently being Texan is a big thing because with it comes a lot of old school habits like: a girl should never touch a bill or a door handle... Well I'm german, I feel bad if he's paying for it all the time, but love the door handle thing. Anyway that's not the point, even If it counts into it a little. 

Back to the story:

So we went on our first date: first going for a walk with my dog, going to dinner after and having 2/3  drinks. It was amazing we linked really well and I took him back to mine. Well things got a little heated, he ate me out like a starved man and left with the words ""I'm trying to be good right now"". 

Well that was that. Things took a sexual turn ever since, we go still on dates on Saturdays usually but I do stop by for a night of sex thru the week usually. The sex is great, he's not what I'm going for usually, which is new to me but I like it and he's blowing my mind sexually. Also I'm not the cuddly type usually but turns out I can be a snuggle monster if treated right.

So we do cutesy shit, like he cooks, we do the bathing together relax thing, I get t shirts, he gets panties left behind, period sex, it's all very relationshippy to me. But we never actually talked about where this is supposed to go. I mean we seem to be exclusive, he fucking adores my body, sex is amazing etc. All great. But I don't know him well enough to go down the relationship path. You know what I mean ? Like if we together it's great there are no sec. thoughts but when I'm back out of the bubble it's like, hmm who am I and what is this?

So I need advice about dating habits and if this is me sliding right into a relationship I'm not yet ready for. Or if I'm overthinking shit again and should just go with the flow and it will present itself at some point.

"So I have an ex from a few years ago. I wanted to off myself so bad because they wouldn‚Äôt believe me when it came to all his friends n family saying I was cheating on him.

No matter what I did it was always him suspecting I was cheating. I gathered all my stuff one day and left. Because no matter what they wouldn‚Äôt believe me. I cried myself to sleep every night made myself sick. Didn‚Äôt wanna eat anything. I began to drink to numb everything. I have no idea what clicked in my head but something did.

"Is this ""ghosting""/rude? Hi all - sort of a silly question of semantics around the definition of ghosting - bear with me:

\- Say you go on three dates with someone - nothing happens beyond a polite kiss goodbye after date 2 and 3

\- They leave town for a week for work

\- When they get back, YOU leave town for a week for vacation

\- When you get back in to town, you reach out to them to make plans.  They respond that ""it's really busy this week but lets reconnect next week""

\- They do not reach out the next week to reconnect, and you don't hear from them again.  You also don't reach out again because you already did once, and it seems like they won't at this point and are just not interested.  Oh well!  You move on.

In either case, settle a debate - is this being ""ghosted""?  Or this is just a casual dating relationship that naturally faded out?

"How to navigate an early relationship if I want a commitment? We've been dating a month and a half now. Things have been great, aside from this weekend (I will get to that below)... We started off strong, though he started off lying to me about just getting out of something with his ex. She started messaging me the first week of us dating (I guess she saw that he and I were friends on IG)... Basically, he had just paid her rent (she claimed they lived together and she wanted him off her lease but he said he is not on her lease and I believe him) and he just bought her a sofa. She also sent me screenshots of another girl saying he was ""playing house with her 2 months ago"" ... based on that, I already knew the ex's timeline didn't add up (they just met this past January and he and I started dating in June, so how was he living with her and playing house with someone in April...) Either way, all of the drama made me very skeptical and even when things would be going well, I would express my doubt to him. For instance, I brought up to him late one night after a night out that I think he's dishonest because he's always at my place but has NEVER invited me over his. In that same moment, he told me to get up and get dressed. He took me to where he lived, with his grandmother, which reassured me. We spend a lot of time together (at least 5 days a week and he sleeps over). This past weekend wasn't good for us, though. Kind of a bump in the road... we went out to bars with his friends and kind of did not get along. Definitely a mixture of drinking and probably overdoing the festivities. 

On Sunday I ended up telling him I wanted to take a step back because the weekend left me with a terrible feeling-- Friday, I got drunk and argued with him and when he walked away in anger to calm down, it alarmed me so drunk me thought it was a good idea to call his ex and ask if his behavior was normal. I hung up before she answered and apologized to her for calling. I told him I called her and he was upset but we didn't dwell on it. Saturday, we had an outing at the park and had a wonderful time, then he wanted to go meet his friends at a bar. We went and he was basically limiting my drinks-- understandably so because I acted a fool the night before. I had a bit of an attitude so he went to the bar to get me a glass of sparkling wine with his friend, who was getting his date a drink. This guy was trying to flirt with me when he came back and he got upset with me and basically ignored me for the next 30 minutes. Really rubbed me the wrong way. Sunday morning when we woke up, I just thought it was too much and I wanted to spend my day alone. He insisted he come with me to run errands though, so we stayed together. Later on while we were watching a movie, he just seemed so distant. I was relieved when he had to go pick up his friend. That's when I told him we should distance ourselves. He assured me he wanted this and was afraid of losing this and wasnt going anywhere so I said, okay no need for the distance, but he agreed two days would do us some good. We saw each other again yesterday and just watched a movie, and I was surprised when he wanted to leave after because he usually stays the night. When he left I asked him where his head was and he said nothing has changed and that we're just getting past a bad weekend. 

I would really like some advice on how to proceed in a healthy manner. I really like this guy and I want him to want to commit. On Sunday we were watching a movie and he said something like ""a man knows within the first week if he wants to commit to someone."" Should I take that as a red flag since its been a month and a half or should I just trust his actions (consistent contact and effort and always wanting to see me)?

"One heartbreak after another 6 months with my first partner were some of the greatest and happiest moments of my life. We broke up 7 months ago and I was absolutely shattered to the core. Now, I 21M met this other person 21F who I was interested in for around a month. Turns she was really into me and she showed a lot of interest in me which I‚Äôve never felt before. I was later quite addicted to this feeling of being wanted that I made a shitty decision which you‚Äôll read in a moment. After a great first date at an ice rink, she made it clear that all she wanted was a casual relationship, nothing with a future possibility of something long term as she was an international student. I was once again heartbroken, so I called it off. Quite convincingly too. A few hours later, I call back changing my mind while giving her shitty reasons like ‚ÄúI too want something casual‚Äù when all I wanted was the feeling of being wanted. This was the shitty decision which ultimately drove her away as she ended things a few days later. 

Although we‚Äôre still in touch, this girl doesn‚Äôt even show the same enthusiasm as she did before. In fact, she‚Äôs quite dry texting. The fact that I went back to her after making a strong choice, showed her I was desperate which ultimately ended things.

Now, I feel really devastated after this ordeal. All I want is to enjoy my summer with someone. I don‚Äôt want anything long term atm because I‚Äôm not mature enough for it yet and I just want something casual with some commitment because I‚Äôm going into my final year of university and I just want intimacy after being starved for so long.

"One of my best friends just found out her husband asked me out a few years ago and had a crush on me, now she's acting like she doesn't want to talk to me I have a friend group through my son's school (I'm a single mom). I consider these really close friends of mine and we hang out a lot and have dinner parties and movie night. I mentioned to them that I'd like to start dating again and what I'm looking for - I'm a single mom so dating has been really hard for me the last few years. One of my closest friends said her husband (let's call him John) knows tons of eligible bachelors at work. This guy John works at a big tech company (think Google, FB, Amazon) and is very well to do and so I liked the idea of meeting his friends. I was out to lunch with my female friend and asked her to ask her husband to try to set me up with some coworkers. We got to talking and I mentioned I would like to meet a guy like her husband, ""I missed the boat with him"". She asked what I meant and I told her John had asked me out a few years prior in a completely different setting and it wasn't the right time for dating back then and I turned him down. She immediately had a look of horror on her face like I had told her that her mother had died. She got quiet and just asked ""what?"". I told her that John and I had met through a volunteer organization a few years back and he made a pass at me and she asked ""why did you turn him down?"". She seemed upset all of the sudden. I tried to explain to her I wasn't really dating at the time and wasn't interested. Every since our chat my friend has been ignoring me, at least from what I can tell. I texted her asking if John can introduce me to some of his coworkers and she just texted back ""I don't think so"". I don't understand why this information was so difficult for her to process and what I did wrong.

"should I tell him how I feel? 
hi, i‚Äôve recently run into a situation with the guy I really like/am talking to (?) that I would like some advice on. 

I met this guy about a month before the end of my first year at college. He drove down from a city about an hour away to come visit me on campus. We really hit it off, we talked for hours, smoked, watched a movie, got takeout, and talked some more. He visited me again about two weeks later, before I left to go home for the summer. He took me out to dinner and we had another wonderful time together, we really connected and explored town/talked until the late hours of the night. We laughed about how we were shocked we met on Tinder and ended up connecting this much. He kissed me at the end, and said he‚Äôd like to stay in touch, he even offered to have me travel up to the summer camp he works at over the summer. 

We‚Äôve been texting and exchanging memes and stuff all summer, and I‚Äôve been so excited to see him again in the Fall, but we‚Äôre not official. 
Yesterday he called me to check in and chat, which was really nice. We laugh so easily with each other and seem to get each other really well. 
This is where the dilemma comes in. 
He told me his scholarship for his college in the city by mine wasn‚Äôt renewed, so he isn‚Äôt returning in the Fall. :( I was really sad, but I didn‚Äôt really show it outside of saying it was a bummer, which he apologized for but I assured him it wasn‚Äôt his fault. He said he may look at other colleges in the same state, but also mentioned another state as a possibility. 
I want to tell him I want to stay in touch with him regardless of where he ends up, and that I really like him and would love to see him again at some point, But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too much or not.

"Am I overthinking things with this girl I‚Äôve been talking to the past month and a half? I‚Äôve been dating this girl for a month and a half now. We see each other every weekend and we have great chemistry. We spend the whole weekend together laughing, cooking food for each other, cuddling, going on dates, watching movies etc. However, her texting recently has progressively gotten worse. 

Initially, we would send multiple messages per day, and towards the evening we would start exchanging back and forth texting for a little bit before bed. Then it started to fade towards a few texts per day, to just good morning and good night texts. Now, I sometimes don‚Äôt get anything back from her for over two days. Currently haven‚Äôt heard from her in over a day after just being at her place on Sunday. 

But the thing is, she‚Äôs actively making plans for us to do on weekends. For example, she invited me to come over her place this weekend. We are very intimate together, she‚Äôs introduced me to her friends and hangout with them often. It‚Äôs known to them that we have something going on as we hold hands in front of them or I have my arm around her.

I really like this girl and we haven‚Äôt talked too much about our expectations and wants. The last time we did was about a month ago when she asked me what was going on between us. Deep down I wanted to say let's be exclusive, but I didn't want to scare her off after only talking two weeks at that time. So, I said I'm just going with the flow and seeing where things go, but that I enjoy spending my time with her. She said the same, and I followed up by asking if we're dating other people. She said that we can, but if we do we'd just have to let each other know. 

She's a great person and we get along so well IRL, but I just wish I could get some more communication out of her when we're not together physically. And we're not official yet, so I know she doesn't owe me anything, but it just makes me unwanted. Then I go into a spiral of thinking worst case scenarios in my head, and that she's over me or talking to someone else. I'm aware I have this anxious attachment style, and I really am working to fixing this. Maybe the next time I should bring this topic up with her again and tell her I really like her since it's been a bit longer now?

"Am I too obsessed with dating? Hi everybody, I (19m) am asking this question because I genuinely feel like dating is too much for me already.

I‚Äôm a rookie at dating, like real rookie. I wanted a girlfriend so bad throughout high school and it contributed to my depression that I experienced then. I never wanted a girlfriend for the thought of it, I genuinely wanted one and I know it.

I decided recently to sign up for dating apps since I don‚Äôt really have a social life. At one point I had Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble on my phone all at once. At first it was fun, but it got super overwhelming because I was going on so many dates in so little time. I also felt like I had a problem because I wouldn‚Äôt ever go on a second date with any girl I went with. I had 0 idea how to do anything. 

I got super hopeless and started feeling bad about myself again. I deleted all the apps. If thats what dating is then I never wanna do it again, its too stressful and overwhelming for me. I feel like I wasted so much time when I genuinely wanted to find someone.",[deleted],1,1690398219.0,1.0,1053,206,1053

I personally have never had something last longer than a month where I felt it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt it‚Äù and I also never thought to sleep with someone if I didn‚Äôt know if I even liked them.

She was a mother of 2, literally just starting to date 5-years after her divorce. I am a single, childless professional, who is likely to move to another country in 18months.

The last 6 weeks have been great. We just went on a 3-day holiday together. At the end of the holiday, I think she‚Äôs become uneasy with the fact that I probably will move away. I cannot guarantee whether I will or I won‚Äôt, neither can I say if I‚Äôll come back.

I'd like to have at least 2-3 Girlfriends before I turn 40, since I am actively trying to avoid the whole end up marrying your first partners that happen to a lot of late bloomers I have known or have observed happening through stories online.  And I don't want to only get one person to date.

I know a guy who is a chubbier dude who is now married and has an adopted kid and he met her back when we were both like in our early 20's. 

I do not want any kids, and I never want to be married despite thinking of becoming catholic since I believe in Birth control, Abortion and condoms. I'm not going to go into WHY I am so far behind because that would basically be a book and I wrote a post telling the whole thing before. but it does have to do with Chaotic living situations and taking care of dying and much more disabled than I family members.

There's certain types of people I will never date despite the fact I'm supposed to be obligated to date them, or society says you have to be willing to, I'd rather be alone in that case. I am not attracted to my own race and even if I were 99% of the people that have the most in common with me are from outside my racial background anyways, so I'd end up dating more of those people anyway.

 I don't like curvy women with large breasts and big butts like certain types of models, I like modestly sized, women. 

I started a tinder profile despite not having a flattering photo, swiped nope on single moms because I am not interested in any kind of kids or family, plus i want to avoid sex with a woman who has given birth, nobody should lose their virginity to that and I don't want to hang out with kids or have someone who has someone other than me as their first priority except their parents.

I also swiped nope on black women because as I sadid before I am just not turned on by women of my own race, and I also automatically swiped nope on curvy women because large body parts don't appeal to me. 

Sydney sweeney is pretty as an example but her boobs are just too long and saggy. Somehow I like Mila Azul although her boobs are round but not long and saggy or flapjacks which I find to be gross and I would not have sex with a girl with ugly breasts.

However, at a recent \*sport\* competition, my friend pointed out that everytime we passed by him he was always hanging out with girls.

I follow him on IG and noticed that he's always liking posts of girls with a certain aesthetic. Pretty girly girls, asian influencers. (eg. SandyDianaBang, Helen Peng) I like following these girls too, but because I like the way they dress too and I wanna know what makeup they're using. But it's like he's the only guy to pop up on nearly ALL these girl's posts. A LOT.

The few thoughts that come up are like ""Wow. He's girl crazy."" ""He likes this type of girl huh?""

What do y'all think? Is it not a huge deal, or is he a ""Wear My Hug At?"" type of guy. Is he girl crazy cus he wants his pick of the best? To understand the female brain?

He's super popular in our \*sport community. Everyone loves him, and have said he's super sweet. I've chatted with him a few times too and yeah, he has golden retriever energy. But someone has said before that he seems to be girl crazy.

"How can i meet women and, most importantly, interest them ? Hi. I'm 25 and lonely. Physically i'm average, the real problem is that i'm awkard and kinda boring to talk to 

The thing is, i'm not a chatty guy, at least with people i don't know well. Back in school/collegue it took me several months each year before i spoke to classmates regularly. I improved a bit since then, but not by much. I can make some small talk to begin a conv, but people just get bored eventually. I just don't know how to make conversation or make myself interesting. I spend most of the time listening to others. How can i even meet and interest a woman in those conditions ? I feel like i'll go nowhere if i continue like this, but also that my attemps to change course are futile. 

Right now, i have a remote work job, so i stay home most of the time, and a dwindling social circle from old friends. 

I just went to a vacation where you're supposed to meet people (and hook up are common), and i can make small talk during meal just fine. But it stopped there, i haven't made friends. I don't drink and i don't have fun in the night-club setting, which i feel is a strong negative in those settings. I don't think it's just a case of ""you'll get used to it"", because i've been on similar vacations 3 times and to night clubs like 10 times: i wanted to force the change, but it refuses to come. On this point i'm not pitying myself i just think it's not for me.


Hobby wise, i go to the gym regularly and take drawing class. Also there, i can make small talk with strangers just fine, but that's about it. I started salsa class recently (but so far it's the same story). 
I also tried cold approach a handful of times, and it stayed consistently akward, i made precisely 0 progress in hours, i'm not getting better at it. But when i can't make normal conv to begin with, this was expected, so i'm not surprise or sad about that. You can guess how well i did with dating apps... 

To put the nail in the coffin, everytime i tried asking out or on date a girl i got rejected, like 7 or 8 times (+ during the cold attemps). I know those number aren't really high, but everytime i try it's a kick to my associal ass. My approach is visibly garbage, but i have no clue how to do it",FireZura,1,1690586707.0,1.0,2261,438,2261
"Interested in someone asexual So sorry if this is all over the place but I tend to overthink things, but also want to keep it vague as it wouldn't surprise me if they're on reddit.
So as the title says I'm interested in someone that is asexual. They've consistently surprised me at every turn at how much we have in common, I think they're absolutely beautiful, and frankly they're an all around amazing person. I could sing their praises all day, but it may just be me being infatuated with them. I don't read people incredibly, or even mildly, well. Most people I've dated in the past have been VERY direct, like grabbing my junk and let's get it on, direct. Being asexual, they wouldn't do that. We've cuddled, and held hands, but it's not like they haven't shown that kinda affection to others around us, not quite to the degree they have with me, but it has me guessing, are they interested in me, or are they just that open with their friends?
I just want to date this person as of right now. My past experience says go for it they're interested, they probably want to jump your bones but are holding back because they're waiting on you to make a move. But again, they're asexual, so they don't get those... urges.
I need advice about what's the best way to talk about this with them, without risking the friendship we have going? Or are they just cuddly but not interested in me, so don't read too much into it(?)

"Expecting guys to pay on a first date and low effort men? (Rant) I feel that when guys do pay for the first and next few dates of the dating process, it shows me that he has interest in me and gives me the sign that he is willing to be a protective caretaker. Just based off of the family dynamic of my parents, my dad is the breadwinner and works to take care of my mom. My mom has been a stay-at-home mom and rarely works--to be honest, she probably has worked a total of about 2-4 years her whole life. I guess my mom has always raised me to believe that when a guy is willing to pay for things, especially in the beginning, it shows that he is capable of taking care of you and is a reliable man. However, I know that this is a very traditional view and I do think this way of thinking has become an expectation when I go on dates. Don't get me wrong, probably 99% of the guys where I have gone out on dates with will pay for the first date...but I think by them doing that it has made me see it as an expectation and expect him to pay for the next, next, and ongoing dates. I just don't know what I can do to remove this ingrained belief that I have known based on my parent's way of dating. And how should I suggest meeting guys then on a first date where we don't have to spend so much? Also, I noticed that when I initiate guys to meet up for the first time and suggest meeting up again, that is when they get all low effort and put no energy into the connection. I have found some guys on dating apps would just message me for 3-4 weeks and no sign of asking to meet-up; so I was just assuming they were shy so then I ask to meetup and then they either they me they are busy or meetup but then also slow down and not let me know when to meetup again. Online dating is just so frustrating and boring...I feel like I end up wasting so much time messaging and talking with guys who put zero effort in actually meeting up.

My previous relationships before her were long term as well.

"Am I just a booty call? I (F21) have been seeing this guy (M21) for a month or two now. We talked and texted a ton before hanging out. We met through Hinge.

He definitely gets really nervous, awkward, and shy when we hang out and never really knows what to say. Since then, he‚Äôs stuck with inviting me over at night after he‚Äôs been drinking or after we‚Äôve both been drinking.

Here‚Äôs where it gets confusing: when we hang that late, I assumed he wants sex but we haven‚Äôt had sex because he gets whiskey dck and can barely hard enough. Yet he keeps inviting me over after he‚Äôs been drinking. He just wants to kiss, cuddle, sleep and spoon together, talk, show me stuff he‚Äôs been up to and talk about each other family, friends and life. He‚Äôs always saying that we don‚Äôt have to do stuff and he wants me to be comfortable with him. And whenever I can‚Äôt hang with him, he‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúI kinda wish you were with me‚Äù etc.

However, now I‚Äôm super confused because that‚Äôs usually a booty call if he‚Äôs calling and inviting me over during times from like 9pm-1am?

"Past experiences TW; brief mentions of abuse. Hey there.

I'm beginning to get back out there in the dating world, after my last relationship ended primarily due to an unwillingness to communicate, him being emotionally incestious with his family, and my PMDD definitely played a part I think. 

I also suspect there was some sexual/another kind of infidelity on his side, but it was never confirmed. The signs were there, and I also think that maybe also just had some massive issues dealing with serious past trauma, especially as he just didn't want to communicate, and would rather shut down, and not put any effort in.

He also KNEW my serious past trauma history (DV, and being the victim of multiple types of abuse &amp; assault) when he decided to betray me by using intimacy, to gauge if he felt anything for me anymore, which was essentially the #1 biggest hardest boundary I drew and communicated to him that wasn't to be crossed &amp; was an automatic relationship game over move if it were to happen, when the relationship started.

Now that I am getting back out there and meeting new people romantically &amp; for relationships, I am so scared of mistaking something for loveb---ing, for example, because it's what I've gotten in the past. Like if a guy is just affectionate by nature (eg. golden retriever puppy in human form), I'm nervous I'll mistake it for loveb---ing, and heck things up when they're perfectly good, even after all my relationship trauma therapy, and continuous therapy that I'm going through, &amp; getting.

For example, am talking to a new guy, and we just click, and I'm being wary and careful, while not self-sabotaging. He's flirting, but I think also because I'm on the spectrum, my mind is like 'wtf is this sorcery, and how do I deal with it?!'. I don't know how to respond.

I've dealt with my trauma enough to know that I'm safe to be interpersonally intimate at least with someone again, because I have the presence of mind to try and not let my past traumas actively affect my present relationships (friends, romantic, platonic &amp; everything in between), and to work on the problem behaviours when they come up.

**How do y'all tell the difference between someone just being affectionate (which I'm not super used to, and with my mind doing it's job and trying to keep me safe, it jumps to the worst case scenario immediately), and love-b***ing?**

Dating your old friends boyfriend Recently I reconnected with an old friend. He was my high school best friends boyfriend . We remained friends while the girl who was my friend stopped contact with most of my friends and I in college. She thought she was too cool for us . No drama there. He asked me on a date last weekend and I am interested but I‚Äôm subconsciously thinking how he dated my ex friend . Even though it‚Äôs been 8 years and I feel a bit weird about it. Should I do it ?,badandsad97,1,1690913645.0,1.0,483,96,483
"And now she wants to be friends So long story short my girlfriend (28F) and I (39M) split properly last week. This was after she split with me but then wanted to get back together on a casual basis. I was happy with that but she kept cancelling dates and coming up with excuses why she couldn‚Äôt see me. I said I couldn‚Äôt do causal that involved only seeing each other for 30 mins every two weeks as I needed more connection. I felt I should be pursuing something else which wasn‚Äôt possible for me if we were involved, so we mutually called it off. Ultimately we‚Äôre not compatible and there‚Äôs no future in that relationship.

I didn‚Äôt hear from her in 5 days and wasn‚Äôt expecting her to reach out. I felt like it was all done and dusted and I‚Äôve been trying to move on with my life. The weeks and events before the breakup caused me a lot of worry and anxiety, I was glad it was all over tbh and was feeling good about myself again. She text tonight saying she wants to be friends but without blurring the lines of that friendship. We do have to take a class together next year so for the case of civility I‚Äôd be happy to be friends, however, not just yet.

I‚Äôm not sure how to respond to the text yet. I feel I want to do no contact for bit before I can say if we can be friends or not. Also I want to focus on me and move forward with my life. I feel that‚Äôs going to be difficult if she‚Äôs texting as ‚Äòa friend‚Äô and stirring up memories or if theirs ulterior motives. I‚Äôm too old to be playing these kind of games. Would I be unreasonable to say I want a months no contact before deciding to be friends, also we‚Äôre not compatible anyway so don‚Äôt worry about the friendship lines getting blurred.

"My crush likes by best friend So I met this guy (my crush) at college gym, he was always there when I went and we started sharing some glances, and sometimes he asked me if I was using some machines so I started thinking that we were flirting (cause I was).  The days passed by and I noticed that we had a friend in common, so I asked my friend if he was single and she told me that she wasn‚Äôt sure, but she was going to find out, so since that day I saw my friend and this guy closer, and we never talked about it again after that. I was still into him but trying not to make it obvious, until I saw him with a girl (he started dating some random girl ), I got so sad because I thought that I had a chance, but I never tried talking to him or getting closer cause I was so afraid of rejection.
Some days ago my best friend, let‚Äôs call her Lora told me that my crush told a friend that he thought Lora was 10/10, and if she had come into his life earlier, it would have been perfect, but he already had a girlfriend.
This made me feel even worse, like if I had imagined all that we had (maybe I was) but I don‚Äôt really know how to deal with this because I will keep seeing him at college, and I feel sad and jealous that he thinks that about my best friend and not about me.",PuzzleheadedAd8154,1,1690584555.0,1.0,1274,263,1274
"The difference between having a type and not. I want to start out this by saying I feel really conflicted and kind of guilty about this. And if I‚Äôm playing into some sort of gross race thing then I sincerely apologize. 

Ok, so when I (I‚Äôm a male) was younger me and my family went to a basketball game live at a stadium. And while we were watching the game there was this attractive woman sitting nearby, she was Asian and apparently my interest must have shown because ever since then, my family has done nothing but tease me about liking Asian girls.

It infuriates me, they think that just because I like things like anime I‚Äôm into ‚ÄòJapanese girls‚Äô and stupid shit like that. I was raised to believe everyone has the right to be treated equally and fairly but something about the way they poked fun was‚Ä¶.gross to me. And it made me feel gross about myself.

But now I‚Äôm starting to actually get into dating (I didn‚Äôt really in my teens and twenties because I wanted to be more focused on my education) and I kind of find myself preceding Asian women.

Now that‚Äôs not to say that I only find myself attracted to them! I‚Äôm guilty of finding women of all cultures attractive. But I just‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôm towing a moral line here, I mean obviously there‚Äôs nothing wrong with finding some attributes of someone attractive, but I don‚Äôt feel right about race being something that factors in. 

And there again, this is purely physical appearance, personality is the biggest thing that can decide what you feel about someone, but it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶..I don‚Äôt know, I feel like I‚Äôm treading some possibly bad water here and I want to know what I should do.",Goodhearted_Jake,1,1690584270.0,1.0,1642,298,1642

I moved across the country 9 years ago and have begun realizing how much I screwed up not taking a chance when opportunity was there.  I think we were both really into each other but I was so broken from bullying in high school and being backstabbed by people I thought were friends and had huge trust issues so I probably came off as not interested even though I was head over heels for her.

"How to best explain to my bf just how selfish he is as English is not my first language I‚Äôve (29/f) been dating my boyfriend (27/m) for 8 months now and I have been seriously thinking of breaking up with him. However, I do need help on what to tell him which led me to want to do this.

For context, he‚Äôs my first boyfriend and the past few months have made me see things clearly and I do not like what I‚Äôm seeing right now.

Out of the fights that we had, the worst one was the one we had when we went on holiday to see my favorite band in a music festival. He bought the tix after we had a previous fight as his way of making it up to me while I booked the hotel. 
When we arrived at the event, he got uncomfortable with the amount of people and kept on asking if we could go out and come back later when my favorite band is playing. He kept on doing this until I got pissed off and we went out of the concert grounds. I explained to him that the moment we went out, we won‚Äôt be able to go back to that spot as it is not a reserved place and that every minute, more people are getting in. He knew it was a big event with and estimated 45,000-50,000 people.
In the end, I didn‚Äôt get to watch the band I love and he got upset because I got upset. 

Also, I spent almost 1k gbp for everything (food, hotels) during the entire holiday where I spent half of the time crying while he gets to enjoy and go to his favorite spots.

After 3 weeks, we had an honest talk, aired out what made each of us feel hurt before making up.

Now, he stayed in my house for three days and used up all of my towels, toiletries and groceries while refusing to drive me to work because he‚Äôs tired. I did all the cooking and cleaning while he was at my place.  

I can see now how selfish and a parasite this man is and I would like to ask for help on how to tell him how selfish he is to me as English is not my first language. I want him to understand and feel just how he used me in those instances. He previously phoned me saying all mean things to and one of which is I was using him but it‚Äôs not true.

"Coworker Situation So there‚Äôs a girl that I work with. She started a few months ago. I noticed her pretty quickly, she had the kind of eyes you could get lost in if you‚Äôre not careful. She works in a completely different department than me, but I technically have a more senior position in the company. 

A couple of weeks ago she came into my office.  Needed to review a document. She positioned herself at the side of my desk and knelt over to show me specifics on the document. I was immediately aware that if I wanted to I could see straight down her dress, but I‚Äôm not an asshole. I maintained professionalism. Then she stood up as if to leave, repositioned herself *directly the fuck in front of me* and bent wayyy over to continue explaining the document. Again, didn‚Äôt even think twice about maintaining professionalism. 

Fast forward a few days, she stopped by my office for another work related thing and mentioned that she broke her toe. I said ‚Äúoh no, that sucks‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúyeah, look‚Äù and she took her shoe off to show me how it had bruised and monologued for quite a while about how it happened. I‚Äôm in no way one of those feet weirdos, but it just felt so intimate for a work setting and with such limited interaction between us. 

So that happens, and that‚Äôs when I was like ‚Äúhey wait, what the fuck was that bending over my desk move? Was that on purpose?‚Äù To myself. 

The only other real interaction since then was when I had to call her for clarification and she answered the phone with ‚Äúhey darling.‚Äù Which was a super weird superlative to use if you‚Äôre trying to drop a hint. 

So what do I do here? It seems entirely plausible that I‚Äôm completely misreading the situation, and I recognize the my own vulnerability in that I noticed her first. She‚Äôs definitely extremely outgoing, which is the opposite of me, so I might be mistaking common niceties and social mishaps for advancements and I‚Äôm not about to risk my professional reputation on a slim chance. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, we‚Äôre both mid 30s. She‚Äôs a little older and divorced. I‚Äôm just habitually single.

"Anyone else tired of the excessive location bullshit on dating apps? I'm so tired of literally being FORCED to put my location on every single time I use the app. Like just fuck off already. You already have my fuckin location; save it and use it. 

I understand all the excuses about ""it's like this because there's so many catfish accounts""... it doesn't make it any better. If humans could quit acting so shitty where they need to constantly spam and scam everyone, everywhere, all the time, then this wouldn't be an issue. 

Two of the biggest culprits I'm seeing atm with this are Tinder and Bumble. But shits definitely on other apps too. Shit even apps that AREN'T dating apps are forcing locations (like weather apps). 

Just let people choose their damn location. Quit forcing me to turn location on just to simply USE the app for anything. I sidestep these apps on purpose but when they're the predominant apps people use, it isn't really possible just not trying it. 

Again, like I said, I understand why they do it, but they shouldn't HAVE to do it. 

And then all these apps and their bullshit subscriptions. Like quit putting everything behind a damn paywall. Everything is a way to capitalize/profit from you nowadays and it's ridiculous. I will never, ever pay for a damn dating app and honestly NOBODY should. It shouldn't even be a thing. If people quit falling into their exploitive practices, and didn't just toss away money every opportunity they have, maybe these companies would finally see that and change could happen. 

Not every single thing on earth needs to become a subscription. Quit exploiting people's loneliness and desperation for your own profit. It's ridiculous more people don't see this. Or care. 

Lol you can't even see the people that liked you on these apps without paying and that's literally redundant to the whole point of dating. Same with the apps that prevent you from simply messaging. It's ridiculous. These companies honestly don't deserve a cent from people ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Ghosted after an amazing date? Let me preface this by saying that I don't really get ghosted but he leaves me on delivered for a day at a time and then he responds with one liners that don't create any kind of conversation.

So we had a couple of days that were amazing and both were initiated by me but he acted like a gentleman in both instances. I even said no to sex with him on the second date and after that he still wanted to see me and was nice about it. We don't live in the same state so I have to travel to the neighboring state to see him. He seemed so shy and almost in love that even my friends were surprised. And after I left, nothing. He leaves me on read, doesn't reply until 24h later and barely views my stories. I'm going back next week and he said he wanted to meet but I don't understand his behavior. Now, I'd think it's because he doesn't give a damn, but it apparently isn't?

I texted him about his ghosting and he replied 1sec later telling me that he's busy, not ghosting me, and apologized. He also waits until my stories almost expire to view them which gives me the suspicion he's playing hard to get and is into mind games. After I left I thought he'd block me or unmatch me or both, but he hasn't so far, which is weird for a duckboy, so I'm completely lost. 

A few things that might shed light on the issue, though, are:

He said he didn't want a ldr but kept talking about the possibility of dating and also brought up kids and marriage on the second date (I didn't, I kinda laughed awkwardly when he suggested dating).

We didn't really have dates dates, I brought him with my friends both times (althoufh the first one we ended up at his place) and he's a bit shy.

He gave off vibes of either a narcissist (kept talking about himself) or a shy person that's trying to look cool and impress the ""hot girl"", clearly doing it wrong.

He said he's very picky with women and was a fuckboy years ago after a breakup but didn't really like it because first time sex is awkward to him, so now is trying to find a wife (he's traditional) because he already has a stable job and money.

When I post a ""thirst trap"" (selfie looking good) he posts one that same day or the day after lol

He told me he's bad at texting before this issue began. However I've seen him text his friends during our ""dates"".

He says his best friend is hyped about him getting with me. And he also tried to impress my friends (girl and guy) and be extra nice to them. My girl friend says he's just shy and we are misjudging him, and my guy friend says he's a narcissist and a POS (the guy friend wants me so idk about that opinion).

"I'm about to confess my feelings tomorrow through a love letter, Please give your opinions! Things I should improve on! Also how to deal with the consequences 22:00; July 29~ the saddest/happiest day of my life.
Dear Anne, 
So, this is gonna be a long message. It'll be my SINCERE  request to go through it all üòä.   I still think it's too early to talk about this, especially when you're still in recovery process after the breakup, but I thought it'd be the perfect time to rewrite/replace a memory. 24th July was the anniversary which didn't go as you expected.. and today could be the day which you might be happy to remember for the rest of your life.üôÇ(just my silly idea yk, I tend to make dramatic memories, I adore memories)

You were curious to know who my crush is? üòÖ

From the first day of our conversation I had a gut feeling that you could be the one, and I was so sure of it before even seeing your face. Anne with an E brought us close, made us relate to each other more and I'm sure this is just the beginning of it and there'll be plenty of relatable memories. Also the fact that the connection between us have existed forever and discovered only recently, makes me think that maybe it isn't too early to talk about this. Maybe we've been neighbors in the galaxy forever and sequence of events brought us closer together. 

We both know what we've been looking for. The purest form of love which will never disappoint us, never make us regret, never make us cry a river, will be free from toxicity of human mind, will preveil beyond death, will let us sleep peacefully, will let us sail through the ocean of life smoothly... I've been waiting all along to find the right person to show up and with you it was an instant spark ‚ú®

It's my one last chance at love.. my only way to resurrect love. I've never written an essay to someone like this. But this is going to be the last one, so I'm really thinking to present myself as neatly as possible before you, Anne. I'm too hesitant to call myself Gilbert Blythe, as I don't possess the charming look and personality he has. I maybe the ripoff version of Gilbert Blythe ordered from online üò≠. But I want to love you the same way Gilbert loved Anne. I really wish I could send this as a letter though, could've been more perfect. 

About distance, I'll quote you here ""we all belong together"" ... It's only a matter of time that we could possibly meet. Though physically we are distanced but I'd love to close the distance as soon as possible. And I promise I'll present myself to you as the best version of myself..  

Now, share your dreams please! You think you're the only one with dreams of 30 cats and 19 goats?! Wrong, let's do this together! I don't wanna miss the chance to be with Anne in her dream ""Green Gables"" ü•∫. We love the same things, we cherish the same things.. I'm the potential partner in crime, shoulder to cry, companion to trust. I wanna be a part of every dream that you wanna share with a partner. Not just that, I wanna relieve you of every nightmare you face. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, I'll always try to make it even better I promise. I would like to grow together with you, communicate with you, take care of you, travel to amazing places and discover the mystery of this world together!

An exclusive perk of being with me: You get a personal, free of charge, 24/7 on duty doctor at home. üòé ( I promise I won't hurt you with needles, I'll be so gentle with it)

Now I don't even wanna stop writing because writing about you makes me excited. You're the dopamine surge in my brain. Talking to you never felt boring for a second. And after the face reveal, I was like awwwe.. my heart melted. You know me as a night owl, but I have  been awake only to talk to you dummy! ü•∫. There's been several times I looked at your photo with teary eyes, scared, whispering to you ""please be mine""... so scared of being rejected by you. I am by no means worthy of your love, but your love is all my heart seeks for. Also scared of losing you to someone more perfect than myself.. 

Long story short, I present myself to you with an open heart, visible with all my strengths and weaknesses, my absolute feeling of compassion for you.. I am damn sure about my feelings, are you? You've been the most amazing addition in my life.. I'm rooting to make this permanent till death, even beyond death.

I love you Sarah(pseudoname)... ü•∫. Will you be my Anne forever?

Sincerely your's

"Been having trouble meeting people and dating apps just don't work I've been out of relationship for almost 2 years now and I was still down for my ex but she shot me down multiple times really fucking up my self esteem and so on. But I know I'm not ugly, boring or anything I mean I think I'm not. But in the past two years I've been with a couple girls and all of them were just not it like we start to have sex and I'm seriously feeling nothing from it to the point where we just stop because it didn't feel good, I wasn't in the mindset so on. Basically I can't nut unless I love someone now or at least someone I have a connection with and I ended up talking to someone for a bit and we had a good thing going on, but she was sneaking behind her ex to see me and stuff and I hated that told her that if she's doing this and if he sucks so much you should just leave him and we can focus on us being friends and possibly more in the future and she did break up with him and just got back with him and told me we can't even be friends anymore

"As a man, what should I have learned from the Barbie movie? *spoilers* So I did Barbieheimer. Well I should say I did Oppenharbie, since I saw oppenheimer first. 

I went into barbie with an open mind. I knew it was going to be from a female perspective. I knew they were probably not going to portray men in a flattering way. I knew that I probably would not get the kind of catharsis I typically do. And it sort of fulfilled that. But I did enjoy it. The funny parts were funny, and I loved Ryan Gosling and Will Farrell especially. 

My own takeaway from this movie is that Greta Gerwig totally doesn't get what men want. To her, we can find fulfillment in masculine things like horses and sports. And we want women to be brainless, because we sort of are. In the real world, because we live in a patriarchy (and I'm not saying we aren't), society is set up for my success . And it sort of is. I do have a good career and I can feel safe in public spaces, so I will recognize that advantage. 

But the one thing I think I want is the love of a woman. And, in the movie, that is what Ken wanted, except his character arc ended with him realizing that he needed to be complete on his own. 

So like, with a genuine and open mind, *is this the lesson I should have learned from the film?* I'm asking because it is what women have told me for a very long time. But how do you guys imagine me actually doing that? And what will it look like when I have? Asking for me. ",shinn497,1,1690337772.0,0.6,1467,288,1467
"I (25F) don't know how to proceed with my partners (28F) behavior Ive gotten into a new relationship with a girl who has never experienced being in a homosexual relationship before while I myself have been in a couple. She's told me she was confused and was afraid of letting down her homophobic parents and I've always been understanding about that and said she could take her time figuring it out. That really isn't the problem here.

My problem is that she seems to be afraid of letting people down, seemingly becuase she's in a relationship with me. She goes out with her ex boyfriend who has repeatedly expressed that hes still interested with her. Even sometimes still sleeping over at their formerly shared place even if I've expressed discomfort about it before. She asks him for rides and entertains conversations and going out with him. She tells me its because she wants to keep him close so that she wouldnt have to explain to her parents that she might be with someone new (me), while at the same time she doesn't really wan't to hurt her ex.

I honestly don't mind that shes struggling with her identity, or that she doesn't seem to be fully comfortable with being in a queer relationship. But honestly, her actions hurt and I know she just want's to please everyone else but it almost feels like it's at my expense.

I don't know how to handle this. Should I cut my losses and just leave? Should I stay because she repeatedly assures me that I'm the one she want's to be with? It's all getting a little bit too much and I honestly don't know what to make of it anymore. Any advice?

tldr; my new gf is a people pleaser and because shes afraid of letting people down she ends up hurting my feelings the most.",seiworu,1,1690911710.0,1.0,1722,314,1722
"30 Jewish lesbian...considering saving sex for marriage... Hello! So...so far I have limited sexual experience; I've only had one girlfriend and we didn't go all the way because of her previous history of abuse; this was nearly a decade ago and haven't had any sort of intimacy with anyone since (also, had a painful childhood and teen years and healing from that as well as putting myself through Engineering school have been my priority).  
I've always known that my ideal and what feels most satisfying to me personally is having sex only with the person I'll marry (waiting till we're officially engaged or even till marriage); but for most of my life I've felt it's unrealistic and that persevering in that will mostly lead to frustration/resentment. I feel very alone in this and would love to discuss it with other people, especially if Jewish and/or gay (heterosexual and non-religious or people from other religions are also welcome).  
Also, I worry that women might discard me for my now intentional lack of experience or compare me to exes etc.  
Perhaps the most balanced option is having sex only in long-term relationships (waiting for at least a year before doing it etc).  
The purpose of this post is to find people that relate or in general discuss it to help me decide what I'll do in the future.

"Should I try talking to someone I've tried to talk to in the past? There is a woman I tried texting/talking to while I was in high school, it was the first attempt I ever had at actively trying to talk. Well it crashed and burned lol, I can laugh about it now. 

A few years later, I started dating a girl that was in the first woman's network, it posed no issues or anything like that. We dated for 1.5 years, and broke up a few months ago (rough breakup), and I think I'm ready to move on. Given what I do for work, I'm limited in the time I have to go out and actively seek relationships (working off hours). 

Now that I am single again, and it's been a few years since I tried talking to the first woman, should I try texting or DMing her on Instagram? Or is it in my best interest not to?

Here are my concerns:
- she will tell my ex (which could backfire, since it was a rough breakup)
- facing a ""public"" rejection, where I'm ostracized by the whole friend network (I don't mind getting rejected, just not embarrassed, that sucks)

If I were to DM, what should I say? I've obviously changed since high school, and she still may not be interested, which is alright. Or should I just leave it and not DM? 

Any input helps, I'm a little inexperienced with all this stuff, so that's why I'm here.

"Not sure how to handle this situation Met this girl on a dating site and we matched. We actually studied together during uni and I had this huge crush on her during the start of uni. 

We spoke a couple of times and she seemed really nice but by the time I could pluck up the courage to ask her out she was already dating a senior . Fast forward to about 6 years later and we matched on a dating site. She starts to text me and doesn't remember me at all. So I go along with it and pretend to not know her as well and we stumble upon the fact that we studied together. 

Here's the catch , she is friends with a few people that I know and I'm sure she knows who I am because we share a few mutual connects as well and someone has spoken to her about me  recently. 

Conversation goes on pretty decently. We text about normal things such as work. I'm a bit hesitant to flirt as I normally do on dating apps while texting because I'm confused if she knows me or not ...but still we text back and forth for around an hour. 

The next day she starts to ignore me and after a few days unmatched me on the platform. I am genuinely confused as this has never happened before. 

It's been a few months now and I've gone on dates with other girls but I've seen her on the dating site a few times. 

I'm really curious as to why she texteded me for a whole hour and then ignored me for a few days and later unmatched. I really do feel like reaching out and asking her why she did what she did because I keep formulating reasons in my head. 

Sometimes I wonder if she stopped texting me because she remembered who I am or if the conversation was bit formal and boring because I was hesitant and a bit confused.",SignificanceOk1139,1,1690313050.0,0.99,1700,337,1700

"11 Years My (29m) partner 29(F) just left our 11 year relationship out of the blue. She blind sided me by having all of her stuff moved out of the house while I went away for the day for a major back surgery. 

We were almost perfect. We shared all the same interests, values and hobbies but we were also able to keep ourselves separate enough to remain our own people. I loved everything about her and did everything I could to support her through college. Flash forward to just a month ago a mutual friend has a mental breakdown, almost full on ego death. She is there supporting him and she also experienced a profound revelation of her neurodivergent behaviors. They start hanging a lot more, he asks if it is okay if they hang out alone more and have more space because she reacts strongly to my presence. Sure, I want her to get better and learn the live again. 

They spend all night and day talking, playing video games and spending time together wallowing in their shared funks.  We went from doing just about anything together as a group (other friend is online) to she only really wants to hang out with him. She spends about 20 hours a day at her pc, the rest she sleeps or goes out with her irl girlfriends. 

Five days ago she dumped me out of the blue, all of our mutual friends except our IRL friends who know us well and one online friend who also thought something was fishy. She took everything, she didn't leave a note, she won't talk to me. All I have heard is that she is trying to destroy my name amongst our friends.

"Not sure if he's into me... Hello,

I (m/31) recently ended a relationship a couple months back. I felt I was ready to head back into the dating world, or at least look around for potential options. As I headed out on a two-week vacation to Europe, I received a like from this guy on Hinge (m/27). We started texting while I was in Paris and it turned into a facetime call. It would be around 3 a.m. for me to start this call since that would be around the time he'd get off of work Pacific Time. The chat went so well, six hours flew by. As I continued my trek around Europe, I would fit in a couple hours of sleeping just so I can wake in time to FaceTime him again for two weeks straight. 

We planned a date the day after I arrived back in town despite potential jet lag. Even the night before, we hopped on a FaceTime call that lasted four hours. By this point, it's pretty obvious he's into me and I'm into him. Not everyone would FaceTime someone for hours every day and not be into them, right? 

I meet up with him for our date and I felt the date went...okay? It seemed like he wasn't interested in me anymore. He'd check his phone, not return any compliments or flirts from me. We went to see Barbie in theaters and his body language had him crossing his arms the whole time, I fee like he didn't want me to put my arm around him or cuddle with him. 

At the end of the night, I gave him a couple of souvenirs I had picked up overseas. He collects shotglasses so I picked one up from all the countries I visited when I was FaceTiming him for those two weeks. He seemed very happy with them (he said his love language was gifts), and he gave me a hug and went home. 

During the date, we had discussed on going to another date this Thursday, but he texted me saying that he doesn't want to do it anymore because of money issues/busy schedule. I'm not sure if he's into me anymore. We never had any physical touching such as kissing during the date, and I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I didn't want to force something that he didn't want to do and I'm just at a complete loss.

"28F here. 6 relationships. Wondering if that‚Äôs a lot and if I‚Äôm doing something wrong? I‚Äôve recently realized as I‚Äôve gotten into my late 20s that I‚Äôve had quite a busy love life, but with no luck in finding that one that I‚Äôm sure about. It‚Äôs my biggest dream in life to have an amazing fulfilling marriage and have that big happy family. So while I have been focusing on my education and career the past 10 years, I also have always remained open to meeting and dating. I have been in 3 long term relationships (1-2 yrs) and 3 short ones (6 months or less). I‚Äôve also been in and out of the dating apps in the past and have been on a lot of first and second dates. However, I only met one of the short term boyfriends online, the rest were out in the world (class, mutual friends, mutual activities). 

I‚Äôve been having the feeling lately that this 6 relationships might be a lot of relationships and I‚Äôm starting to wonder what‚Äôs going on. All my LT relationships were amazing in their own way, lot of great memories and I cherish each of them, but there always ended up being these big red flags or incompatibilities that I just can‚Äôt get past and it ends in a sad and traumatic breakup. Sometimes he would be feeling the same way, sometimes not. 

I‚Äôm paranoid that it‚Äôs just going to get harder and harder as I have more experiences. Like I‚Äôll have too much to compare too. I‚Äôm also worried about future potential partners thinking that I‚Äôve had too many boyfriends and being turned off by that.

I feel like most people get lucky and find their spouse after like the 2nd or 3rd LT relationship. I know a lot of people also tend to date for longer, whereas I‚Äôve always been the person to know pretty early on if the relationship fulfills me or not. To also put it into perspective, I‚Äôm from the south, semi-rural, but I‚Äôve moved around. I find both urban and rural settings to yield similar results.

TL;DR: Looking for insight from others who took a while to find their spouse. Is 6 relationships a lot for a 28 year old? Could that be a turn off? Could I be approaching dating in a way that isn‚Äôt working?",myrrhh,1,1690307341.0,1.0,2112,394,2112
"Ask someone out after not hearing from them for over a month? Back in June I met someone at a conference. 

Texting went well at first. Though she said she said she‚Äôs not good at texting. Eventually I wouldn‚Äôt hear back for 48 hours. 

We went out for coffee about a week later. I suggested a second date to a museum and she sounded genuinely excited about it. 

I suggested a couple of days and I didn‚Äôt hear back until 3 or 4 days later. That was on one of the days I suggested going out. She said she was away that weekend and asked when I was free. I said have a great trip and reach out when you‚Äôre back so we can figure out a day. I never heard back. 

Normally, I would say this is over and she obviously wasn‚Äôt that interested. However, I was thinking of reaching out just because and instead of suggesting the museum or something like that, just keep it simple and ask if she wants to get a drink. 

I‚Äôm not sure how to open that conversation or even if I should.

"What would you do in my situation? Guy I met a month ago is moving back to his country Hi Reddit, so a month ago I met a guy and there was an instant attraction. Our dogs got along really well too which was a huge bonus. He's from another country and he basically came here because he was confused and didn't have his life together back home, and he came here because his good friend is here and decided to give it a shot. Since that day, we saw each other once a week and we ended up hooking up on the 3rd time we met. Needless to say, I already knew that there's a chance he will be going back home since he told me on our first date. Today he told me he decided he will go back home around beginning of September, which is faster than anticipated. We still want to spend as much time together as we can, but it's hard with his work schedule and him living 30 minutes away. He also doesn't have a car or license here so he's basically driving his friend's car when it's available / I'm driving over to his house

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is crazy and I don't know if I'm feeling so attracted to him because I know he's leaving and it makes everything seem so heightened. He's from a completely different cultural background as me too. What would you all do in my case? Just cherish the time we have left together? In addition, would you tell your parents about this situation? I'm 30 and still living with my Asian parents, they have no idea about this guy and it feels hard keeping all the emotions to myself.",InterestingDust1,1,1690925513.0,1.0,1513,293,1513
"My ex-girlfriend wants to have sex with me I‚Äôve somewhat been caught off-balance by a recent inquiry from my ex-girlfriend. We both are HSV1 positive and first met on a herpes dating website. Our shared experience brought us together and blossomed into a meaningful relationship. It was comforting and liberating to be with someone who understood precisely what I was going through.

However, as destiny would have it, our emotional pathways diverged, and we decided to go our separate ways. It was a mutual decision founded on understanding for the betterment of our individual lives. Post-breakup, we gave each other time and space to heal and move on.

Recently, my ex connected back with a proposition: to continue having sexual relations. That was unexpected, and it has left me quite confused.

Physically, we are still attracted to each other. Since we both are HSV1 positive, there‚Äôs no potential threat of transmission between us. However, I‚Äôm genuinely concerned about reentering such an intimate relationship with my ex, given our history and the emotional complexity it might entail.

Our shared HSV1 condition brings a level of comfort no doubt, especially when managing flare-ups and understanding the stigma. But, at the same time, I‚Äôm apprehensive that revisiting the sexual aspect of our relationship might reopen old wounds. I worry it could hinder my emotional progress and independence after our breakup.

Consequently, I am struggling with how to navigate this delicate situation. How should I handle this proposition? Is it advisable to maintain a sexual relationship with an ex, given that we share the same condition? If anybody experienced something similar, how did you handle it, and what was the impact on your emotional and mental health?

I've had guys court me, be insanely rich, show me how much they care, but if I'm not attracted to them, I just see them as a friend. Not saying I only go for looks either. If their personality sucks even if they are cute I won't want them, too. Also, I'm now married to a guy I find physically attractive and with a great personality, as well.

I want to constantly text her love messages that aren't sexual but more cute. (The relationship is sexual so far) 

However I feel like I need to hide cuteness. I want to be and act cute but she probably likes me because I've been hiding it and acting standoffish with just a bit of flirting here and there. If I suddenly change that could freak her out.

"I tried to please my boyfriend and it backfired TL;DR - I tried to improve my long distance relationship and instead it turned into a breakup and I feel confused and heartbroken, how can I move past this?

Me (21f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been long distance (7 hours away) for a year, and with that can come arguments. However when we‚Äôre in person we‚Äôre completely fine. I talked to him about doing my year internship in his city so we can be together and he was overjoyed. We found a place and paid a big deposit and I was due to move down today and start my internship a week today.

Last week he turned around and said he doesn‚Äôt like the place anymore and he doesn‚Äôt want to live there, I was of course upset due to how late he had left it as I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find anywhere else now. He suggested living together at his parents until we‚Äôve saved enough money to get our own place, I was apprehensive as this wasn‚Äôt our plan and I like independence (no parents) and on top of that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to do whatever in his house so usually stay in his room, but I said I‚Äôd think about it but if I didn‚Äôt want to do that then we‚Äôre stuck and I can‚Äôt do my internship as it‚Äôs an expensive city and could not afford rent by myself. He then says the place is fine (which is a lie because he‚Äôs already said he doesn‚Äôt want to live there) but I said the place is off the table now as I don‚Äôt want him to live somewhere he isn‚Äôt comfortable with and for him to resent me for it.

8 hours later he rings me and breaks up with me saying he can‚Äôt do this anymore and he doesn‚Äôt deserve me etc. of course I was devastated and tried to fight for him to change his mind, he didn‚Äôt. Since then we‚Äôve had a couple arguments regarding my chances of doing my internship I worked really hard for are gone and how this came out of no where as the days before he was talking a lot about our future, and how I sacrificed so much for him by moving 7 hours across the country with no friends or family to be with him.

Yesterday I asked him for my deposit money back in which he said the landlord hasn‚Äôt gave him it, this then escalated to him saying he broke up with me because we argue too much, I‚Äôm draining and tiring and he wants to move on (he deleted any sign of me off his ig and followed girls back I was uncomfortable with a couple days after we broke up). He‚Äôs turned all of this on me and made it out to be all my fault and he doesn‚Äôt care in the slightest meanwhile I‚Äôm heartbroken and worried for my future. I won‚Äôt deny that we argue, mainly over silly petty things as we‚Äôre both stubborn and recently my mental health hasn‚Äôt been great which can contribute towards it but he‚Äôs said some nasty things to me too yet in person we‚Äôre great.

A couple weeks ago he argued we aren‚Äôt putting in effort anymore so I did all that I could to show him I was (I made him tiktoks, ig story posts, sent him big loving paragraphs etc yet he didn‚Äôt reciprocate) I still tried to be a good person and I sent him all his birthday presents down for him even after we broke up (I wrote him a love letter about our future, I made mini Lego figures of us, I made a picture book of our firsts, the many reasons I love him, a plan of 85 dates for us to do when we live together, and customised vinyl) I also spent a lot of money on a record player for him but couldn‚Äôt sent it down as it was too expensive for shipping, but I was trying to prove I was willing to make effort which he asked for.

A conversation I tried to have with him a couple weeks ago was that I‚Äôd appreciate if he could do my love language more for me (Words of affirmation) to tell me how much he loves appreciates and misses me etc yet that escalated into a big argument as he sends me flowers regularly but I‚Äôve told him as much as I love and appreciate them not to spend money on me as I just love the little things and a message costs nothing.

"5 Years Hey guys, I'm a 25m, I've been in the dating pool for 5 years now. It's all so confusing. Before I was 20 it seemed like I always had some woman hanging around me to some extent.

"I (F22) confessed to a M (26) I liked and it felt wonderful In short, he acknowledged my feelings but wasn‚Äôt ready to commit to a relationship (very ENTJ of him) which was fine by me cause I had already expected this long ago especially when he‚Äôs extremely career driven and relationships were secondary to him. I have already pictured the scenario of the rejection in my mind (yes I am INFP) and to be honest, my idea of confessing in person did not go as planned üòÇ (explained below)

Either ways, the reason why I‚Äôm posting this is that I am so proud of myself for making the first move and confessing to him. Sure, I am sad but at the same time I am also happy. I find it hard to like someone in a romantic manner and he is the first one where I really like and really thought of it beforehand (I am extremely picky with guys since a lot of the guys don‚Äôt meet my unrealistic standards and he‚Äôs the first one I feel comfortable talking with and showing my authentic self without any judgement)

I actually questioned my feelings for him numerous times, back and forth. Constantly thinking, do I like him or not? Always daydreaming and painting scenarios of what would it be like if we dated in my head hahaha. I know, very delusional of me to think of this.

Frankly speaking, I already knew that we wouldn‚Äôt work out, I am migrating to another country and in the process of that and my friend who finished Medical School and going to start his work soon (2 years of housemanship), hence not having enough time to commit to a relationship. 

Before confessing, I typed out what I want to say and feel, why I like and admire him on Word Document (it was 1.5 pages long üòÇ). I really wanted to meet him in real life cause I have never met him before in person (we met through Bumble app) but our times never intersect which I am quite bummed about but that‚Äôs life. Since we talk every day, I have planned to confess to him before he starts his housemanship and since we are close and open with each other‚Äôs thoughts and opinions, I wanted to make a scenario saying that I like someone and wanted to use him as a practice for me to confess, meet him in person and actually do it. Great plan right? Unfortunately, he couldn‚Äôt meet me and he is fully booked. Therefore, when I told him ‚ÄúI like a guy and I still do‚Äù and asked for advice and how I should confess to a guy, he told me to do it honestly and there you go, I confessed on Instagram.

And his reply? He was just so sweet and considerate of my feelings. Sure, we‚Äôre not together but he mentioned positive thoughts and told me that I‚Äôm more than enough and how he‚Äôs happy to hear it from me and he‚Äôs happy to read through my 1.5 pages of my ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù. The fact that he was honest with me that he can vibe with me and how it feels like a breathe of fresh air to have someone to communicate with. And you know what? I am so glad that I like him, he‚Äôs so sweet, nice, smart, humble and I am proud that he‚Äôs the first guy I like. Absolute green flag guy. 10/10 would date and possibly marry.

In conclusion, I feel that with me confessing I am able to get a closure of mine, done and dusted. We are on good terms and we still send each other reels and continue to have each other‚Äôs back and support one another. I think I really lucked out with this guy here cause confessing is super hard especially for girls. Years ago, I would never have done this cause I am extremely shy and anxiety sometimes gets in the way. Today? I give myself a pat in the back and I love myself for doing it. Being a girl and making the first move, who would have thought? 

Anyways I just wanted to share my story here and I wrote this at 4am after confessing to him at 1am HAHAHA üò≠",cynanne01,1,1690920022.0,1.0,3717,719,3717

When I opened up and said how I felt. She rejected me by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pursue that‚Äù

So, I cancelled our next date. I needed time out and went out with friends. (a lot of my friends are women). I guess one of the posted a picture of us all hanging out. And now she is being a bit more respectful.

We spoke on the phone and she still wants to see me and hangout. Maybe she isn‚Äôt ready for something serious. She is a VERY career focused individual. I did set some boundaries. Telling her she can‚Äôt just go through stuff and essentially ghost me. And she can‚Äôt play games of not feeling okay and me asking and her not telling.

She also apologized for her behavior. Said she NEEDED to focus on her Mental Health that week. She was going through it and shit the world out. She has anxiety and dreams but I think it‚Äôs more than that.

I really like her a lot. I do wish I was more successful and I‚Äôm currently working in that. I‚Äôve been treating her like a gf when I probably shouldn‚Äôt have. She used to treat me like a bf when we were first dating. But stopped suddenly. 

We don‚Äôt talk to each other as much. Which is what I‚Äôm sad about. But she is like afraid of letting me go.

We are hanging out Friday. Imma see what happens.
But I‚Äôm not going in with high expectations. I should‚Äôve asked back then, feel like I fucked that part up. We‚Äôve been dating 2 months, into our 3rd. We hookup usually when she comes over. She wanted to meet my brother and play board games with me and my siblings.

But idk if we‚Äôre still dating or she wants us to go as friends. I guess I‚Äôll see. But yeah, I‚Äôm focusing more on my career than women now.

"Help!! I can‚Äôt get over a situationship :( Uh! I need to get this off my chest. I dated somebody briefly a couple of months ago ..went on just a few dates but I became attached too soon. We had a lot of similar interests, wanted the same kind of things from life, the chemistry was great between us ..fireworks! But it was not just the chemistry, there was something about this guy, that felt very familiar and his company was comforting in many ways.. never felt that way about anyone before. He excited me, challenged me but at the same time made me feel safe and comfortable. Sometimes I think it was all in my head but in his company I felt radiant and happy. The problem was he gave me a lot of mixed signals ‚Ä¶ would go days without communicating, (something that my ex did too) but when we were together it all seemed great. He had a lot of past hurt and baggage that I felt he carried along ‚Ä¶ and he seemed beaten up from the online dating scene which may have been one of the causes why he acted the way he did. I‚Äôm not very vocal of my feelings or in the way I show up so maybe he didn‚Äôt get a good read on me ..idk .. but the last straw for me was when we tried sleeping together at his place on our last date (which didn‚Äôt happen) and he asked me to leave despite telling me it would be a good idea to stay over! And that‚Äôs it ‚Ä¶ I let him go. And he didn‚Äôt tried reaching to me either ‚Ä¶ just shared some heartbreak related quote on his social media a couple of days later. Since that day, I have not been able to let go of him ‚Ä¶ I keep thinking about him and not a single day has passed without thinking of him. This feeling is so treacherous I hate it. I want to move on but at the same time the idea that I‚Äôll find that sort of connection ever again is hard to take in as I‚Äôve never felt that way ever! Have been single for years now and I hate to feel this way. üò©",teriyaki_chicken13,1,1690320267.0,1.0,1877,382,1877

"I've changed jobs with a newer, more concrete work hours. And still nothing. Hi I'm 32M.  My old job made it tough to rest as well as meeting meeting new people.  So now I'm slightly happier.  Usually when I message with a decent message like, ""Hello [person], I'm [irl name].  Pleasure meeting and chatting with you."" Since simple ""Hi""'s ""Hey""'s and ""Hello""'s since that sounds low-effort.  I've also been hit with ""read your profile"" line a few times, and I ask to recite a piece of my profile to prove they've actually read it.  No actual answer and proceed to to mention they want to take the conversation to a different platform.

"What on earth is casual dating and how does it work? So, I‚Äôve only ever understood dating where you see each other more and more with rising levels of intimacy, frequency of communication and commitment. It all goes well you end up in a committed, exclusive LTR. If things don‚Äôt go well, you break up.

I have a somewhat anxious attachment style and I tend to match and escalate levels of affection. It tends to get me into trouble when I find myself overcommitting. I can‚Äôt fathom being interested in someone but only a little bit, where you only talk or see each other from time to time, but maybe I should explore it.

"Should I tell her that I have feelings for her? I‚Äôve lived with my roommate for 3 years. she‚Äôs about the same age of me or a bit younger. I‚Äôve had feelings for her for a while but I respected the fact that we live together and didn‚Äôt pursue it further.

We do and did hangout from time to time at some point our bond became really strong and we were hanging out a lot but then it turns awkward and she ends up going back to her room.

I used to hit on her and lightly touch her and she didn‚Äôt mind.

I think at some point we gave a lot of hints to each and she told me I liked this guy but wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs actually talking about me but it was a reference to something we talked about I told her I went on a couple dates which I haven‚Äôt done in a while but I told her I like this girl but for some reason I can‚Äôt tell her and wouldn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for her.

I‚Äôm a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can‚Äôt seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we‚Äôve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn‚Äôt know what to do!

She‚Äôs travelling for a year now and she said she‚Äôll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I‚Äôm extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she‚Äôs been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn‚Äôt tell her since she doesn‚Äôt want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a creep and awkward


She‚Äôs leaving now in 2 weeks. It‚Äôs been eating me from inside I want to get it off my chest. Id love for her to feel the same but if not it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

"Ex initiated contact after I went NC and then left me on read I dated this girl for more than a year. We‚Äôre both in our late twenties. We behaved like a couple, though we never committed - mainly because she didn‚Äôt want to.

I have a couple of dating apps and get several likes/matches daily, however, I am afraid to go on any dates due to the fact that I am just way too boring. I do have hobbies like photography, cars, plants, music and fashion. But in terms of life ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, I have virtually none.

"His boundaries are stricter than mine and he seems afraid to make progress At the beginning of the month I confessed my feelings to my crush (and friend of 2 years) and he returned the feelings. We‚Äôve had a discussion laying out the milestones we want to meet together before considering anything serious (it‚Äôs long distance). I told him there‚Äôs no rush on anything and he agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt rush through it. 

So far it seems like I‚Äôve been the one most responsible for sending messages and suggesting conversations and communication that serve to progress the relationship at what I believe is an appropriate pace. However, he‚Äôs giving me some signs that he feels uncomfortable taking the role of being the one to progress things while also showing that he wants to take things slower than I do. 

For example, I initiated a conversation about our boundaries around intimacy the other day and he seemed a little hesitant to speak up. At one point he asked if I was concerned about it hurting more if things between us fell apart and we had made things sexual. This is kind of concerning to me because I have been working on getting away from the mindset of worrying about how I‚Äôll feel in the future about things I‚Äôm doing in the present because I think it prevents me from living in the moment and is even a little self-sabotaging. Personally, I think it‚Äôs unhealthy (at least for myself) to try and look out for my future self because I figure I‚Äôm going to be hurt either way if things have to end. And if they end before we‚Äôve made things sexual, after we‚Äôve made things sexual, before we get serious, after we get serious, etc. Then to me it doesn‚Äôt really matter because I‚Äôll be hurt in that moment but I‚Äôll never know what the hurt would have been like had we or had we not progressed to a certain point. But it concerns me that he‚Äôs already considering his emotions when things end rather than putting that focus on intentionally building our relationship, whatever that might look like for him at this time. 

Additionally I‚Äôll make suggestions about things we can do to progress things (that are still baby steps!) and he seems very shy to accept or very gently rejects me. He‚Äôs also himself shared that he has a fear of rejection alongside his fears that I‚Äôve noticed about progressing things between us, I feel kind of lost. I don‚Äôt mind being the one progressing things but at a certain point I feel weird about continuously suggesting things knowing that he‚Äôs wanting to move slower or that my suggestions still aren‚Äôt in line with his boundaries in that moment. I don‚Äôt mind the rejection but at a certain point it makes me uncomfortable to continue bringing up these conversations and suggestions all on my own. But if I stop what I‚Äôm doing now I‚Äôm concerned that he isn‚Äôt comfortable trying to progress things even when he might be ready, so things will just slow down and come to a standstill.

"Where may I find women who do not care about looks/height? I'm 5'3"" and 21 (senior in college). How ought I go about dating at my height?
I realize height is extremely important to women and they consider short guys to be ugly; that's fine, it's their life, their prerogative. I've made my peace.

But there is always the advice for short men to go for ""women who are not shallow"" but how does one go about that? Where may I find said women?

I just wanna clarify that I do not care about looks (would be very hypocritical of me if I did lol) at all in women be it body, face, makeup, hair on head or that on body. Just being hygienic regarding bathing and brushing their teeth is enough.

I'd say I'm a good, kind person, I'm as hygienic as one can be, I try to make people smile or laugh as much as I can, am into soccer, critically viewing movies and shows, writing, read a lot, am taking Spanish class to learn the language, learning how to play guitar.

Any advice?",OneLobster325,1,1690367411.0,0.67,1027,197,1027

"Girl has gone cold on me. How do I approach this situation? Hi Guys, I was hoping I could get some advice on how to approach a situation with a woman I'm interested in.   
  
So I recently began talking to this woman on Hinge (she's 29 and im 35). We spoke for a couple of days and I asked for her phone number. She said she wasn't comfortable giving her number out just yet but offered to talk to me on Instagram, which I was fine with, so we followed each other and began talking there.  Turns out we share a mutual friend too, who we are both good friends with (another female).   
  
It's not often I click with people online as I'm very particular with what I'm looking for in a life partner, but this girl really got my attention. She's really cute, polite, smart, respectful, really sweet and we share the same core values, beliefs and morals.   
  
She wasn't a big conversationalist, I did find that I had to always initiate, but she was always responsive, would apologise if she took a while to respond and explain why (she didn't need to do this but I appreciated it and found it respectful), she was really sweet and would always be very appreciative of my efforts, for example I asked to if I could give her a call later that evening one day and she said that would be nice. When that evening came and I offered to call, she said she wasn't up for it that night due to a personal situation that day and wasn't in the right head space and asked if we could do it another time. I said of course, totally understand, told her I would be up for a while longer and if she felt like texting me about it she's more than welcome, otherwise I would message her the next day.   
  
She thanked me for being understanding, and she ended up opening up to me through text for the next hour or so.   
  
After a few days of talking on insta and no phone call, just voice notes here and there (she's a shift worker so it was hard to get access to her when I wanted), I just simply asked her out. She said yes, although she was busy that weekend so she said we could meet up the following week. I said no problem, happy to work around your schedule.   
  
The following week I followed up with her on Thursday to see if she's given any more thought as to when she's like to see me and sent her a link to an event that was currently on and asked her if she'd like to go with me. She said she loves activity dates and would love to go with me, and asked if we could go that night as she had plans over the weekend, which I said yes.   
  
She asked if she could drive to my place and we go together as she thought it would be stressful trying to find me in a big crowd, so I offered to pick her up instead so she didn't have to drive all the way to mine as long as she was comfortable with that. She said she didn't mind, as long as I was okay with it as it was a long drive and she felt bad. I said it was no problem for me and I was happy to do it. I gave her a time that I would be there and booked tickets. She thanked me for being so accommodating and said I was really sweet.   
  
Fast forward to the date, both of us had a really great time. We got to do a fun activity together which allowed us time to talk and get to know each other, and it's probably one of the better dates I had. At the end of the night when I dropped her off home, I walked her to her front door and she gave me a hug, thanked me for the evening and told me she had such a great time and asked if she could see me again soon. I said I would love to.   
  
The following morning I texted her, thanked her for coming and asked if she would like to to go the zoo with me (it's something we spoke about in the car). She thanked me for a wonderful evening again and told me she had a great time and that she would love to go to the zoo with me (with a smiley emoji), and I asked if she wanted to go the following weekend, as she was busy that weekend. She said she can, and I asked her what day suits her best and she said she would let me know and get back to me, with a smiley face and heart emoji.   
  
Later that evening I knew she had an event on, so I sent her a simple text saying I know you're out tonight but I just wanted to wish you a great evening and I hope you've had a lovely day. She thanked me and said that she may not be able to respond that evening as she would be busy. I said no problem at all, no need to respond tonight, I know you're busy, just wanted to wish you a great evening. Talk to you whenever you're free.  
  
The next day she messages me at 5pm, apologises for getting back to me late and then said her dad had a heart attack the night before.  
  
Now before I continue, for context, she doesn't really have a relationship with her dad due to something that happened 2 years ago (her dad was the one who stopped speaking to her).   
  
She said she didn't know what her movements would be like next week as her dad needs a triple bypass and will be in the hospital for a bit.   
  
I replied back and said that I was sorry this happened and that I hope her dad will be okay. Told her I was sad for her and not to worry, we can go to the zoo whenever she's up for it. Asked her if there was anything I could do and if she wanted to talk about it. She said not to worry, and that she's not close with him, however he is still her dad and that she needs to be there for him physically to assist.   
  
I replied and said I totally understand, and to do what she needs to do. I told her I was heading out shortly but to text me if she wanted to talk, and thanked her for letting me know. She left me on seen. I thought this was odd but didn't read too much into it.   
  
Admittedly, I was pretty bummed out as I genuinely really like this girl and I was honestly not sure if she was blowing me off or if she was being legit, as I'm not quite sure how invested she is in this situation. Nonetheless, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and carried on.  
  
The next morning I sent her a voice note just asking how she's feeling and that I had to rush out the previous night so didn't get to talk to her properly, but asked if she was okay and how was she doing. She left me on seen again.   
  
I thought no biggie, she may be out and can't listen to it. Not an issue (not the first time I've sent her a voice note).   
  
She was at a kids birthday party that day (she posted it on her story), so I figured she's just busy and would reply to me later. Nope, nothing. Waited until the next day and still nothing, even though she posted another insta story in that time.   
  
I texted her at 5:30pm and said 'Hey \*\*\*\*\*, just wanted to check in with you and see if you're okay as I never heard back. I hope everything is okay, and I hope you had a wonderful weekend üòä'  
  
She replied and said 'Sorry I‚Äôve been with my dad and now I‚Äôm prepping for my night shifts this week so I will continue to be a little MIA'.  
  
I replied 'Ah ok fair enough! I understand. I'll give you some space. I hope your dad's surgery was successful. I'll just touch base with you in a few days. In the meantime, if you feel like talking, feel free to message me'.   
  
She left me on seen again.   
  
I don't know if I'm just overthinking this, but her coldness towards me seems rather strange and out of character. I get she may be going through a difficult time, but I'm struggling to tell if it's just that, or if she's no longer interested for whatever reason. I'm just not sure how to proceed from here. Do I reach out in a few days, or just leave her be?  
  
I feel really bummed out as I really like this girl and would love to go on another date with her, but I'm not sure where I stand and it's driving me nuts. I would honestly just love to know if she's still keen, but I'm not sure how to approach her to get that answer without coming across as insensitive to her situation and potentially ruining my chances if a second date is still on the cards. I also don't want to seem over bearing or smothering. How should I approach this?",Robin_Bankss,1,1690363128.0,1.0,8088,1601,8088

"Talking everyday? Long story short: Is it truly a sign of no interest if someone doesn‚Äôt check in with you daily after hitting it off well in person and even sleeping together after a few dates?


I‚Äôm really taking my time to work on myself while dating.

And I just wondered if in the past I may have demanded too much attention or wether my POV of normal behavior was or isn‚Äôt.

So I‚Äôd like to know some opinions.

After you spent time with someone, let‚Äôs say hypothetically you met someone online, went for dinner hit it off, end up sleeping with them on date 3‚Ä¶. 

Are you supposed to have consistent contact now? I read that if someone is interested they would check in w you daily.  But I‚Äôve had instances where the guys wouldn‚Äôt always do that. And I would feel a way because online it says it means he doesn‚Äôt care- even when he shows in person that he does.

I‚Äôm not talking about ghosting. When I text I get a reply. But is it really a sign of disinterest if someone doesn‚Äôt check in every day? 

Or is day 3 regardless of sleeping together still considered ‚Äúcasual‚Äù and so it‚Äôs more ‚Äúsee ya when I see ya ‚Äú I‚Äôm just confused on what to look for. What‚Äôs a green flag and what‚Äôs a red flag‚Ä¶",Euphoric_Teaching_95,1,1690372524.0,1.0,1199,229,1199

Should I ask a girl that my friend is also interested in? I (M 33)belong to the ymca and there is a front desk girl that is very attractive.( F30ish) I forgot about her until she came to the yoga class I goto. She put her mat down next to mine and was so distracted because she smelled so good and was gorgeous. I was in my head saying I have to talk to her at rhe end. I talked to her . I said is this your first time here? She said no I usually am in the back.  I said oh OK what is your name? She told me her name and I said wow you look familiar and that name sounds familiar.  She said I work at the front desk. We started talking and I found out she lives in the apartment building down the street from mine basically my neighbor which she pointed out. But my friend who is( m 51) is also interested in her and they seem to be friendly towards each other. My friend is religious and this girl isn't so he said he might not ask her. But I want to ask her. I want to be direct though.

"got ghosted after great 3 days I‚Äôm feeling so unconfident all of a sudden

hey guys, just wanna share my story to see what you thinking.
I have been solo traveling for a while and in one place I met this girl, I instantly found attractive and charming. we went out and she got really drunk, we kissed a little bit but I saw her condition I walked her back to the hostel we were in, she said she‚Äôs very into me and sorry she was drunk.

the other day she and another friend she met(I know that from her friend) they were talking bout how nice I am and attractive blah blah blah.
In the evening I wanted to know if she‚Äôs really interested so I asked the friend and she said totally into me so I was relieved.

The night went on we had fun had sex(she told me she hasn‚Äôt done ons or something like that for 4 years) I told her I genuinely like her and she said the same to me.
the day after I had to leave but she stayed there. honestly these 2 days with her felt so great, I never got attached to someone in my trip since I knew it‚Äôd end as a one night stand.

she and her friend planned to go together to another destination. she said she missed me in text and wanted me to come with, we were texting for 2 days and 
I sent her a voice messaged (she didn‚Äôt hear it) about that I could come to see her but she never opened that text.

I honestly thought I met someone I could make meaningful connection with, and my feelings went with it. I made sure she‚Äôs interested as well, but now I feel a little confused since she ghosted me out of the blue..
right now I‚Äôm going to the same destination as hers since I planned to see her. should I let her know I‚Äôm there? or leave it as it is. Like I feel I have nothing to lose here if I text her again, don‚Äôt know about now but at least she was very very interested.

"unfinished business my ex and i dated for about 6 months. it was a bad start as he just got out a 7yrs relationship and they were engaged. so she kept lingering and it drove me nuts, i got really insecure and toxic cause of it. plus later towards the end his grandma died. so he broke up stating it‚Äôs really bad timing and he just wanted to be single. i didn‚Äôt fight him on it and i said that‚Äôs fair enough. 

fast forward 6 months after the break up i find myself still thinking about him. i didn‚Äôt sit on my ass waiting though. i got a new job, new friends and dated around but this lump in my chest‚Ä¶ 

yesterday i texted him finally, cause i thought i was in the right headspace. so we caught up on our lives nothing much. i felt good about it but this lump in my chest‚Ä¶ 

i‚Äôm not ready to see him hence i didn‚Äôt go further with it. i just wanted to reach out to he friendly as i was cold towards the end as i was in shock. we did say that if time was right we could try again so i wanna keep that door open. but yea‚Ä¶ in the dumps sort of just my relationship. other stuff i‚Äôm quite happy being honest here.

"Being nice is actually affecting me I (22M) have been on a lot of dates and when sometimes the girl starts to think I am just too good for her she starts to tell me you are eventually going to leave me and even if I am not feeling the vibe I have tend to spend a good amount of time just to make sure she isn't upset like by dropping her home or staying extra few hours. 

I feel i dont want to be seen or even create an image about all guys are just rude and shit. And even if i want to ping the any girl i have been on a date she is probably gonna be more than happy to connect with me but the thing is I get mentally drained after doing alot of these efforts. And think do I really need to do this? 

Maybe its because on one of the dates I my my date cry cos she said i was being really sweet, romantic and ""very"" cute (apologies not trying to be an asshole) and that reminded her of her ex which is why she was just meeting new people for hookups to forget about him and was not actually looking for a connection like me. I felt super guilty for some reason and it became one of the worst dates ever. 

Another time, i matched with an older girl (25F), made some imprompt plan to come over but I was a virgin that time so I didn't wanna do something to make her upset so we ended up having a 3 hour long fun chat and went to bed, we were almost about to sleep i looked at her and came close and we kissed and when i started to take her dress off she said, I never had sex before, which i knew was a lie, but we agreed to do 3rd base and i could see here getting little not comfortable and we decided to let it go. I was just mad and wasn't able to finish either so i went to bed. Then for some reason i made her breakfast and made sure she reaches her home cos she was new to the city. When i discussed this with my friend he told, we are not supposed to do all these and its okay to just ask her to leave in the morning. I don't agree with that. I got alot of messages for that girl saying you're the sweetest of all the people, thank you for the night, etc. Tho i never replied to her.

Honestly I have happy that i am able to do good for them but its just that do i really need to make all these efforts just to make them feel good and get upset and think im just another jerk who's just trying to get in bed. 

Should i stop doing all these things and just straight away say it out loud if its not working anymore or im not feeling it with her?",Marc0sOP,1,1690368558.0,1.0,2453,513,2453
Miss being in a Relationship Do you not miss being in a relationship constantly having someone to talk too and confirm what your doing all the time. And talking about your day.

"Guy checked up on my socials, ghosted after I messaged him Pretty much what the title says. I noticed a guy kept viewing my empty tik tok profile every few months, for around a year (I think longer?), although I didn‚Äôt recognize him at all. One day, after he‚Äôd viewed my profile twice in a week, I worked up the courage to message him and ask him who he was and why he was checking out my blank profile. He was a bit embarrassed, and admitted we‚Äôd talked on a dating app before (over a year ago), and I guess he remembered me from that. 

I didn‚Äôt really get why he was viewing my profile and not messaging me, but I thought it was a bit sweet that he recognized me, so we chatted for a bit. He seemed really sweet and earnest, and made comments about wanting to hang out after he got back from a trip, and told me he‚Äôd like to keep in touch while he‚Äôs gone. 

To my disappointment, he went on his trip and didn‚Äôt message me once, despite being online. Even after his trip was over, I heard nothing from him, so I deleted him. He didn‚Äôt owe me anything since we never dated. 

Now weeks after ghosting me, he‚Äôs viewing my profile AGAIN, and following me on my socials. I sent him a message, letting him know why I unfollowed him, and asking if he wants to talk. I waited a week and got not a single response from him. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some insight? I‚Äôve already deleted him since he‚Äôs clearly not taking me seriously, but why would a guy check up on me for MONTHS, but not actually communicate with me? I‚Äôm so confused, TIA!",tiramisuand,1,1690565092.0,1.0,1538,297,1538

When he cheated on me he unfollowed every girl for me and uninstalled every social media app when I found out to show he changed keep in mind I never told him to do this he  did it to show he changed. 

Later on he told me ‚Äú you know when I unfollowed every girl I was expecting you to do the same yknow like unfollow every guy‚Äù by this I was utterly confused? Was he doing that to just gain control of me did he really mean it. He used to tell me stuff like ‚Äú if I can‚Äôt have you no one can so I might as well just kill you‚Äù and proceed to call it a joke. I used to find out some things about him like, he used to fetishize asian women I found old messages  of him doing it  and people calling him out saying how wrong it was as his response would be ‚Äú like I give a f*ck‚Äù by this I was utterly uncomfortable and confronted him about it I told him it made me uncomfortable he basically told me it was in the past it wasn‚Äôt a big deal etc. i went on with my day but I did find out weird stuff about him which I lost it.

He gave me this thing called ‚Äúprogress‚Äù where I‚Äôll have to do certain things to get it up so I can be with him again.

And many others I can‚Äôt believe it I‚Äôm done with this bullshit‚Äù when I saw this I told him off and gave him a piece of my mind calling him a shitty person controlling told him his childhood isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a bad person etc he kept telling me to calm down but I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances and kept going he then said ‚Äú ok make sure you eat have a good day‚Äù and blocked me.

he told me I broke another promise because he wanted me to block this guy while we were dating and when he found out I unblocked him he got sad and said I  broke a promise by unblocking him even tho we are no longer together.

"caught feelings from my friend and in the end I had to go end our friendship I met this friend back in janurary. She was a former coworker of mine. throughout our time working together we have gotten close. When i left the company she kept in touch with me. She would call me everyday and we would hangout occasionally. I ended up catching feelings for her. I know she had feelings for me too so in the end i asked her if she wanted to date and she happily agreed. Sadly the timing was bad tho because she had a lot going on in her life. She wasn't in the space to date so in the end we didn't date. At this point I thought I moved on but then when I heard her talking about another guy i realize I still had lingering feelings for her so in the end I ended our friendship so that I could fully move on

I still think about her time to time which shows i really liked her. Sometimes I do question if i made the right choice. I do know she is a good friend and i feel like having someone like her in my life would be good but i don't know what is the best thing. She always made me feel special and I always see that she cares a lot about me so when i ended our friendship i did feel bad and also felt like i lost a good friend

tldr: basically I ended a friendship because i still had feelings for them and I don't know if that was a stupid reason to end our friendship",throwawaydates69,1,1690369067.0,1.0,1369,281,1369

"Help this 21[M] out So hello guys and girls, its 21 yrs college going male this side. I got a gf. I think i love her the most. It is a long distance relationship we stay in different cities, i have moved out for my college about 2 years back. I met a girl here in my 1st year of my college. our vibes matched so quickly that we became bestfriend in no time. In recent past my when i and gf had a major fight, things got little physical with my girl bestie. My gf found out and the fight became worse but later she forgive me.

"Women: Ask the men for exclusivity instead of making theories about what you are. I genuinely want to help with this post and I think it's important that women take some moment to really think about their situations with men.

I see this time and time again. Women asking here on the forum about what to do in their current situation with a guy and it's always the same type of posts and the same type of answers.

The woman is invested, \*KNOWS\* how she feels, \*KNOWS\* what she wants and instead of communicating that directly to the guy about whatever troubles her heart or wanting exclusivity in a firm manner where she lets him know that if he's not going to give it she's looking to end it.

Instead of doing that... She comes out here seeking advice and all the advice from other women is the same: ''block him'', ''drop him'', ''he seems like a player'', ''this happened to me as well and was very hurtful''.

Just hurt women give hurt advice.

You don't know if he's a player or whatever he is until you ASK, it's when you ask and you're firm about it and show him that you're serious that you'll see his real intentions. You'll see it in his actions.

The last thing I want to say which nowadays for some reason isn't politically correct: It's the woman's job to seek exclusivity. It's been like that since the beginning of time.

Think about it... You're beautiful. Sought after by a lot of men, getting a lot of interest and so on... And here comes a man who for whatever reason is the main option for you. He passed all the tests, whether it was his looks or his way of communicating or his energy or all of them combined. He essentially was better than everyone else. He probably did some form of pursuing until he got intimacy, now after intimacy it's on you to keep him.

Or as women do you want the men to do everything? Pursue you to get you, and pursue you to keep you after intimacy? Like it literally doesn't make any sense if you think about it.

Also furthermore what a lot of women don't understand is that you're probably dating the top 20-30% of men who have a lot of options. If you're on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge or even going down to the local bar. You're not going to go with the boring/dry or not so attractive men. You're probably going to be with the men whom many different women like. If they're attractive to you and likable to you then they also appear that way to other women.

These men are already getting both invites to relationships frequently and women who want to spend time or date casually and so you're always in direct competition with these women.

At the end my final advice is this: if you meet a man and you don't care that's fine do whatever you want, but if you met a guy who essentially is the main guy for you and you are invested pursue him and communicate with him. You literally have nothing to lose. You'll only find out if he's the real guy for you by his actions afterwards.

Also some of us men need that. I needed my ex girl to communicate with me frequently and pursue me for a relationship. I had no clue whether she was playing me or not. Like quite literally, no clue. I needed to see her efforts over time. I was already attracted to her and enjoyed her company more than the other girls I was seeing at that time (we were not exclusive in the first 1-2 months)

Her doing what I felt was the job of the feminine made her stand out from all the other women because it showed me that she was a good girl. That instead of her playing the field and not caring and doing the ''female player'' type of thing she was actually interested in something real.

One of the big reasons for me going exclusive with her besides actually liking her and enjoying her company was that she was persistent and feminine. Showing me time and time again over the period of 1-2 months that her feelings was invested and she really wanted this to go somewhere.

In the end we ended for some different reasons two years later, but at least it was a fun ride.",abbehardy,1,1690363614.0,0.57,4002,751,4002

"Social Anxiety with Girls, should I go to the psychologist? Hi community,

I'd like to have some advice from you. I'm a 26M that never had a relationship or sexual experience in my life, I'm an average looking guy, 165cm, skinny, I work and study, traveled a lot, definitely not too boring but maybe not being interesting enough and/or not showing interest in the correct way.

&amp;#x200B;

I always got along well with women, have a few real friends and this is nice. However, I a-l-w-a-y-s failed when trying to show interest to women and since I moved to a new country (all by myself and alone) a few months ago, everything is being much harder. I basically don't have any woman friend, just a couple male friends. My goal at this moment is to get a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending several hours of my life during the past years just watching PUA's videos and reading articles, posts, advices in general but I can't put it in practice. Although I know that approaching a girl in the street can be so easy and have awesome results, I have kind of a ""blocker"" in my mind that literally doesn't make me take the action to do that. I start getting nervous/anxious in a very high level just by looking at an interesting girl.

As an example: I met a girl a few days ago, we had some nice convos in the first day but I felt myself too nervous and most likely I was looking too desperate that she didn't talk to me the same way during the following days...

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to consider going to a psychologist because I'm so sad and disappointed with me that I'm unable to approach a girl or have a conversation without being anxious and looking desperate to pick up her. What do you think? I know that practicing maybe is the only solution for my case but the problem is that I am unable to put it in practice because of my f\*\*king mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating apps are also bullshit for me, never get matches or the ones I get don't answer me (and no I'm not the kind of guy who say just ""hi"")

In brief, I have 3 big problems problems to solve before even starting a relationship:

\- Social anxiety with women I find interesting

\- Showing interest the right way without looking desperate

\- Be interesting for women

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't say bullshits like ""oh you're too young, don't worry"", first no I'm not too young and second everybody who says such thing was able to have at least one experience, no matter if it was bad or good

"I think my partner doesn't like me I (34f) is in a relationship with (42 male). Things started out great in the beginning. Even though we are long distance technically ( we live roughly 2 hours from each other), We were seeing each other almost every single weekend. He was doing everything great and the connection felt strong. We've been together for about 6 months now. He has never been inside of my home only to help me move. I never been to his but I have seen his house and his parents which is a couple of doors down from his. Now we will see each other once a month or twice a month.

Such as he won't say that he misses me or struggles to say what he likes about me. He'll even say things like, ""Oh I like you because no one else liked me"".  When I call him out about different things that he says he tries to clean it up so that it makes more sense.

Sometimes I feel like I was loved bombed and he just got super lazy. And then there are times where I feel I'm not fully understanding him because he doesn't know how to communicate properly.

"What could I have done differently sex wise so she would have wanted a relationship with me? Prefaces: we will never get back together as she‚Äôs got a boyfriend and I‚Äôm doing my best to move on. Also sorry for the long read as I overthink badly sometimes.

So I dated a girl for about 2 months, on the 2nd date she told me she wasn‚Äôt over her ex. I should have stopped dating her after that but I carried on.

When we had sex, I couldn‚Äôt perform as normal (I.e. when I feel completely at ease). I was taking finasteride and also told her I needed time to build a connection with her before I could perform fully. I‚Äôm not taking finasteride any more and haven‚Äôt for years. I‚Äôve always struggled having casual sex as I feel uncomfortable not knowing the girl I‚Äôm having sex with on a deep level. She always looked distant during sex, like her mind was on someone else. But I felt like if I told her about this she would push me away. I appreciated that she might need time to deal with things in her head first.

She broke up and told me she needed time to work things out alone. But then 6 months later she had a boyfriend and took him to Italy with her family. I suspected the reasoning for the breakup was something sex related and she didn‚Äôt tell me for fear I would react badly. She told me months after we broke up that ‚ÄòI helped her through a hard time and a I‚Äôm a really nice guy‚Äô which I assumed was code for she didn‚Äôt find me sexually attractive. But she never communicated her sexual thoughts and needs, other than asking for sex. I felt like she felt like sex was something she did to keep me around rather than wanting to do it out of physical attraction. Plus she always shut me down or turned it into a joke whenever I tried to have any kind of deep conversation with her.

"How do I navigate meeting the son of a family friend? Long story short, I (30F) went through a breakup of a 6-year relationship early this year. I've taken time to sit with everything that has happened and to adjust to my new situation. I'm able to feel hopeful again now and am starting to think to the future.

The son (35M) of a family friend, who I haven't seen in person in a very long time, became single at the beginning of this year.

"Confusing stuff in my last year of college So I (24M) and in my final year of college (I started late due to military service), about to graduate in September actually. In a class during my final semester, I met A (21F) also on her last semester of college. We only started talking 7 weeks ago.

At first, it was casual, just friends in class talking. We eventually went out with some people in the class and after that I started to take an interest in her. I then asked her out for lunch, and it became a semi-regular thing which we would do every few days.

About 3 weeks ago, she went on a weekend trip to another city and asked to meet with me when she came back. Of course, I said yes and we met up at the train station where she came back from the trip. We ended up having a really nice dinner, took in nice views from an observatory, walked together for an hour, and just lost track of time. We missed the last train without even knowing it while we were at a park, just talking about life.

That night, we found a open field in a park to just lie on and talk, listen to music and enjoy each others' company. At one point, we were holding hands and saying how much we liked each other. We planned to head back once the first train came on, but we we continued just goofing around in the park 3 hours past the first train. I did eventually send her back to her place before heading back to mine. After that night we grew closer and closer with more frequent dates etc.

Recently her friends have been telling me to tell her how I feel etc etc and try to convince her to stay after graduation (she's not decided what she'll do after graduating, but she wants to apply for masters back in her home country in a program that will start next September). Another one of her friends even straight up told me that A likes me and told me to just go for it.

I myself, have been accepted into a masters program in the college I'm already about to graduate from, on a scholarship, so I'll definitely be staying here. I honestly don't mind doing long-distance as I've done so in the past and I know I am capable of doing well (the last long-term relationship I had was LDR and she ended up cheating on me when she got drunk and gave into temptation with a coworker she always found attractive blah blah).

This week, I've tried to ask A out for our regular lunches or just to meet up at a cafe, but she would always say she's busy etc. Even last time, when she was busy, she took the time to squeeze in 30min with me if she could, which I found to be really endearing and attractive. Furthermore, in the last weeks, we would text so much until 3am in the morning, but recently, she only texts very infrequently. I went to talk to a mutual friend about this, who's very close with A and she said that A likes me a lot, but the thing about distance is scaring her (Apparently the girls talk a LOT about guys they meet, who knew?). As a result, A has decided to distance herself from me, according to that friend, even though she has feelings.

I honestly don't know what to do because I respect her decision. If she doesn't want to start anything, nothing can be forced and life goes on. Just can't help but feel that this is right person, wrong timing, cuz I feel this could've developed into something special and long-term. It's the first time I'm in the scenario where my head and heart wants different things. Head is telling me if she wants to distance herself and not get into LDR, then don't force it on her. But heart wants to pursue it, even though my head says it won't be respectful to her decision of wanting to distance herself. I'm in a bind, can y'all give me any advice?

"‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worth waiting for.‚Äù Have you ever waited for someone and it worked out? I don‚Äôt mean waiting for someone to be ‚Äúready‚Äù to be in a relationship. That one is a slippery slope.

I mean it more as waiting for someone who you met at ‚Äúthe wrong time‚Äù. Maybe you met them when they were in med school and you barely have time for one another or maybe you met someone who was visiting from a different country. Basically outside factors are causing you to ‚Äúwait‚Äù.

Have you ever waited for someone and it worked or did those outside factors eventually tear you apart?",Lukalesca,1,1690349613.0,1.0,567,105,567
"Something happened and I feel like I don‚Äôt want to see her again. Am I being ridiculous? Hey! 

I‚Äôve [M27] been dating this girl [F23] for almost two months now. I work full time in a hospital and because of university she only works part time at a bar but only like 2-3 days a weeks at most.

Anyway we had some issues but always talked about them. But at this point I‚Äôm sure she will say anything just so I don‚Äôt break up with her. But I think today something broke in me and I don‚Äôt feel so good about her anymore. 

I‚Äôve been working for 2 weeks almost every day. 12 hour shifts and the only free time I had was the afternoon/evening after night shift sleep. On top of that I had very bad shifts, acute cases. We lost young patients and stuff like this sometimes wears you down. So yesterday I have a shift, I‚Äôm ending at 6 pm. We didn‚Äôt agree to see each other that day. She texts me out of blue she‚Äôs sleeping over at my place. So I‚Äôm like okay but I‚Äôll be tired and I planned on just taking a shower, eating something and sleep but we can watch a movie. I just really need to chill out in bed. I explain to her how draining the last two weeks were on me and that I need to chill out. She‚Äôs a future nurse so I tell her how we had some very bad cases that got to me like kids with serious conditions. So she‚Äôs like cool we can do that together. Then she comes over and it takes like an hour so before she starts talking about how we should go out in town because there‚Äôs some event going on and we should go grab ice cream. I keep telling her that we agreed to go Saturday (the event goes on whole weekend) and that I just want to relax a bit tonight. But she keeps asking me to go out with her. So I tell her I would totally understand if she went or in the future if I say I need to relax and she doesn‚Äôt feel like doing that with me we can just meet the next day it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Anyway we stay home, watch movie, get a glass of wine etc. 

So next day which was today morning we talk about my schedule. I tell her we had lots of sick personnel but after Sunday my schedule is all great for August. But I will need Monday and Tuesday. Monday to clean up the apartment, sheets, clothes, floors, windows etc. and Tuesday just for me to do a bit of mental hygiene. But after that we already have plans for trips etc. of course she goes off at me, starts bringing up that I didn‚Äôt even go out with her last night. And this really got to me because I tried my best explain that I‚Äôm exhausted and I would understand if she didn‚Äôt come over and we‚Äôd meet the next day. 

On top of this she‚Äôs mad because my ex gf from like 3 years ago asked me for help. We remained friends but we‚Äôd only talk like once every 6 months over messages. She keeps losing memory for hours and fainting randomly. Doctors are giving her appointments in December and she can‚Äôt pay for earlier ones. So all I did was text her back saying ok I‚Äôll try something. And talked to friend who‚Äôs a neurologist and will check her out. I explained to my gf that from experience I know this could even be a brain tumor and I‚Äôm not even talking to her about anything other than when she should visit the neurologist friend. But she‚Äôs mad about this and keeps bringing it up. And for me it just feels so cold. Like the girl could have something serious and she did help me when Ukraine war started. So why should I not return the favor at least. 

Anyway after all this she apologized over text saying she needs to get used to my schedule and how I work. 

But since then I felt kinda cold towards her. I really dread seeing her again. I don‚Äôt want to text her back. 

How would you feel about this? Am I overthinking? I feel like I‚Äôm done with this but what if I‚Äôm just being ridiculous?",flourishersvk,1,1690574495.0,1.0,3765,748,3765

"Approach Advice: Going Out with a Co-Worker I have a crush on my co-worker. She had a boyfriend when we first met, but they seem to be no longer together. The unfortunate caveat is that she is primarily a remote worker, which limits our in-person interactions. Our conversations, albeit infrequent due to our different teams (around once monthly), are always engaging and can last up to two hours.  


  
How should I get closer to her outside of work? My connection with numerous teammates extends beyond work, although they belong to a distinct social group that she might not easily assimilate into. The challenge I face presently is my apprehension about initiating non-work interactions and that I might get too conspicuous how what I feel.  


  
How should I transition from ""work-friend"" to ""girlfriend""? Ideally, I would want to hang out with her a few times outside a professional setting before asking her out.",tinderdating23,1,1690357953.0,1.0,921,152,921

"7 month with this girl of talking and telling eachother how we feel and say he has feelings and they are growing Well iv been friends with this girl for a while like 7 years M
25 and she F 24 so va she started this relationship I was just being her friend but I saw that I was getting feelings when we started to talk.
We told eachother how we felt and we both felt the same, both had feelings and wanted to see how it went. I invited her to 2 dates and both time it went great we both clicked. I would also go every month to her work place to drop off food and gifts just one day every month.
Recently I told her that I'm ready to move the relationship to be official and she said she had a lot on her mind and told me she need time to think before she make any decision because she doesn't want to do something she will regret later. I told her that she can take all the time she wants. So I slowed down my texting with her to give her time to think. I will still send her good morning snaps to show that I'm still here for her and she send them back and their personalized to me not like a S and that all.
I'm willing to wait. Told her sister BF what I should do and he said i should have a talk with her. So today I told her
""hope your emotions are doing good amd if she needed to talk that I'm here"" so basically inviting her to talk to me but not being like I need a answer now.

"I (22M) have been single my entire life and I'm just so tired of it I've only had two crushes in my life, an unrequited one when I was 17 and now this one with one of my best friends, which everything points is unrequited as well.

It's not like I have trouble putting myself out there, if anything this is the most socially active I've been in my life - while I wouldn't say I'm popular, but I'm pretty well liked with quite a few people saying I'm a passionate and funny person with tons of personality. Heck even my friend group consists of 10 members all of which I trust with my life. It's just that developing romantic feelings for said person is almost downright impossible for me, let alone being interested.

I know that made me sound like a complete self-centered jerk and I'm so sorry about that but I swear is what they've said about me.

Over the years I've worked on myself and, while I still stride for more, I'm happy with who I am - it's just that sometimes the dread of not being someone's special person is a bit too hard. I've never kissed or slept with anyone and it was just recently I held someone's hand.

I know that I must be patient and that forcing anything will only result in a terrible relationship which is the last thing I want to do, but you know there's just so much love, kindness and affection I've been yearning to share with a special someone and not being able to is emotionally exhausting sometimes.",ShrekTheOverlord,2,1690854031.0,1.0,1440,270,1440

"I keep thinking about a guy I had a situationship with &amp; wondering if I should tell him how I feel Our 2-month situationship was 2 years ago and we haven‚Äôt talked since, but we still follow each other on social media even though we both unfollow our exes. In many ways, what we shared was more romantic/beautiful than some of the official relationships I‚Äôve had. It started nonchalantly on a dating app we were trying out to casually chat with new people as the pandemic dragged on. Literally just to talk, not to hook up. We messaged for the 1st month and weren‚Äôt planning on meeting until we realized how much we like each other. He told me he got excited whenever I messaged him.

Then I initiated our 1st videochat which happened to be on Valentine‚Äôs Day and was really fun. A month later, we met in person twice and it was like a dream. We biked, cooked, watched tv, cuddled/kissed and led to 3rd base. He comforted me when I lost a loved one which meant a lot to me. We had happy hours and played word games. What I didn‚Äôt like though is that he is very sexual and wanted to watch porn together or have phone sex with toys during our chats, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised he wanted to have sex in person but I declined and he took it well. We were happy to just spend time together and finally meet after a build-up.

The sad yet also romantic part is that he was about to move away and any relationship for us would be starting long distance. He said he would‚Äôve asked me on a real date if that wasn‚Äôt the case. I had to step away earlier than he expected because I was developing feelings for him. He didn‚Äôt know that was the reason; I just told him I thought it‚Äôd be better this way since we couldn‚Äôt start a relationship anyway. Not long after that, he got into a relationship with this new chick and it broke my heart. Even if we weren‚Äôt talking, I didn‚Äôt expect him to move on so soon.

I recently moved to his favorite neighborhood (where we met, not where he moved to) and find myself thinking of him more. I never got over him and I think he‚Äôs single now. But I‚Äôm so afraid that he just said all those sweet things to keep me talking to him until he left. And that he just sees me as a hook-up. And that I would be making a fool of myself telling him how I feel and that it‚Äôs just me having a stupid crush. I also worry that his career is entirely different from mine, and practically speaking I‚Äôm not sure how sustainable it will be. What do you think I should do? Any advice or insight?

"Why do casual ‚Äúfun‚Äù partners have a different standard applied to them as opposed to relationships? I just saw a comment from a woman and it made me ponder this more.

As a guy, I think this applies for most. For HOOKUPS we often LOWER our standards.

This woman was commenting on a post where they were talking about height in dating. 

She said: 
‚ÄúI'm sad for him. Yes it's harder for short men. I know my gf and main FWB swipe left on every guy under 6 unless he's fall-off-your-chair handsome (and even then not less than 5'10). They are looking for casual sex though.‚Äù

So this seems to imply that women LOWER their standards but for RELATIONSHIP partners. This kind of tracks with what I‚Äôve read elsewhere but that was awhile ago, and could be false, idk.

Why is it the opposite between genders? Is that okay? Is casual fun inherently different than romantic fun?

"To early for that?

Since I started working and studying, and now just working I have pretty much left my ""crazy life"" behind, meaning I don't really have the energy to go out and party and being in a an environment full of people, I prefer to go with my close group of friends have a beer smoke one talk and chill. She on the other hand is quite a sociable person likes to party quite frequently at least 1/2 a week all in all that's not really a problem for me. Once I get to know and like someone I like to devote my attention to that person and I don't get romantically interested in anyone else, and I like someone that has the same mindset. The thing here is because she was way more of a sociable life I'm a bit insecure because I don't really know yet her intentions with us and if she is interested in being exclusive I would like to ask but I'm afraid that it's to early for that can someone help me with some advice?

he‚Äôs fine, good guy and very hardworking people. and ofc he‚Äôs always busy and his time was too limited in a day. and i‚Äôm very understand that. at first he‚Äôs really good at managing his time. but these past few weeks.he‚Äôs changed. we rarely call each other only text. but after that, even text he can‚Äôt make it. it just ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm home‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm tired‚Äù and ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. only that. at first i can accept it. but day by days. i realised i felt hurt. so told him about how i feel. in hope, i can discuss about this with him. but in return, he keeps on saying that he‚Äôs a bad guys because make me feel like how i told him. it‚Äôs not only one time but a lot of times. everytime i want to discuss with him about these things. he always brags about he‚Äôs a bad guys. i hated that so much.

i feel like unwanted in this relationship. he always told me about how tired his life. but when it comes to me he always said that i cannot feel that ways. basically he‚Äôs not validated my feelings. i‚Äôm tired too. i have so much things to be done too. but now i‚Äôm fine a little bit. because i just finished my diploma. less burden. i told him i mentally tired and drained. he just said okay and pity you??? i want him to comfort me like how i‚Äôm comfort him when he is not okay.

not only that, i have like a big social group containing a lot of guys. we just friends and i only close to only 2 of them. and he felt jealous because of it. but him always told me about those girls whose love him before. i‚Äôm so annoyed with him, because he keeps telling me that those girls always chasing him but he doesn‚Äôt even like them. okay bro you don‚Äôt like stop telling me about it. start from there i never tell him about my days to him. but he don‚Äôt bother to asking me why i stop talking to him about my day.

he stopped wishing me good night before he went to sleep. eventho i already reminded him to texted me before he went to sleep. everyday. but still, he keeps saying sorry and forgot to text. 

i gaslight my own feelings to save the relationship but at the end. i can‚Äôt make it. it eats me up. i feel like burnt out because of it. so i decided to cut the relationship. i want to tell more but i‚Äôm tired to think about it. that‚Äôs it.

"Does this guy like me? There was this guy (unsure but looks around 20-22M) at my (19F) company that is really attractive, though I rarely see him other then on the hallways as we work in different divisions in a large corporation. I was very scared of talking to him because I have Autism and doesn‚Äôt want to come off as extremely awkward and ruin everything (I am horrible at talking to strangers and was just average looking myself). However, a few days ago, I saw him by chance eating at a restaurant, I sat next to him. I was confused about something on the menu and decided to ask him about it. I said ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù and he started looking at me, so I quickly looked down. But he was very nice, answered my question, and was laughing loudly the entire time while talking to me. I so badly wanted to talk to him again so I asked him how to open the pepper. And it happened, he started laughing (unsure of the type of laugh, but it sounded a bit nervous). When all my attempts failed, he leaned all the way across me to help me open (likely because the space is too tight and crowded to walk across). At the contact, I started blushing, not sure if he noticed, but he started laughing even louder. The last instance is when he‚Äôs leaving and accidentally dropped something, so he went to pick it up and at that moment our eyes met and he smiled and looked away.

So here‚Äôs the question. Why was he laughing? And do you think he likes me or at least have a positive opinion of me? I wanted to ask for his contact the next time we meet, but I‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôll make fun of me.",Expensive_Holiday_97,2,1690564451.0,1.0,1575,304,1575

"Am I basically supposed to wait until I'm 26 before I can date? \[Tl;dr: I'm constantly bombarded with the message that unless I make money I'm not worth dating, but I can't start working until I finish studying in late 2025. Am I supposed to wait until then to get a relationship?\]

I (23M) have never been in a relationship. I've recently started doing the work to take more care of myself and to be more socially open. Nevertheless, I'm feeling pretty discouraged, because I feel there just aren't so many opportunities to make connections (I live in a Mediterranean country, where chatting up random people is not socially acceptable the way it is in America). I tried returning to archery as a hobby, hoping it would get me more connections, but everybody is either under 18 or above 30.

But what's been bugging me recently is how I constantly get messages from society and even individual people that basically I am not worth dating until I can make money. (Yeah, you'll now be thinking ""no shit Sherlock, nobody wants to be with a broke ass guy mooching off his parents!"", but bear with me). I graduated mere days ago. The whole process was an ordeal because Covid crushed my mental health like a hydraulic press does glass, so I took 4 years to complete instead of the canonical 3. I have weighed starting to work, but even after applying for some remote jobs to no avail, I realized, together with my therapist, that I'd rather focus on studying as soon as I start my master's degree in September; I calculated that if I started working, I'd be either studying or working at least 50 hours a week, and I'd have only one hour left per day (including sleep, showering, commuting, sports and so forth) which I see as unsustainable. Even my friends that work have said that they'll have to delay their degree due to this, something I really want to avoid this time. In the while, I'm decidedly NOT mooching off my parents - I almost never spend anything on myself except some McDonald's maybe twice a month. Everything else I take is just gifts for my birthday or degree, which I would get anyways. Also, bear in mind that we don't have a cultural expectation to move out of your parents' house as soon as you turn 18 - many people here move out late in their twenties.

So in short, I think I made a sufficient case that I'm not some slob playing videogames all day in his mother's basement, but I'm actively trying to build my life - just not in a way that makes me make money right now.

Where does dating come into play? Well, because as I said, I constantly get the message from society that men are only worth dating if they make money. In no particular order, I've had:

* Countless Tiktoks of women saying that \*not\* splitting the bill on dates is the ""bare minimum"" and that if you aren't making sufficient money to pay for them you shouldn't be dating in the first place;
* A female friend commenting that I ""can afford not working because I don't have a girlfriend, because girlfriends are an additional expense for men"";
* Girls evaluating men in terms of how many flowers, gifts, dinners and so forth they buy for them;
* A guy who commented that it's worse for men to be broke and, upon me inquiring, tacitly admitted that it's because of relationships;
* In general, even outside of conversation about dating, snarky remarks about me having no job yet

If it were just one instance of this happening, I would dismiss it as a shallow person being shallow, but after so many times I \*have\* to start believing they're onto something.

It does break my heart because all I want is to be loved by someone else, and I honestly don't care about ""scoring a 10"" or something. I think my only standards are: loving me, having something interesting to your personality. Even my looks requirements are pretty loose, I think. Even if I didn't make money I'd find a way to make my girlfriend happier, maybe by giving her emotional support, helping her out when she can't do something, validating her, making art for her, taking part in her interests, you name it.

Nobody has said this to me out loud, but I'd be happier if they just told me I have no chance at having a relationship until I have a job. Considering I'll be able to get a stable job only in late 2025 unless I quit studying, that means I'll only have a girlfriend when I'm turning 26.

\*But\* I'm also nervous about waiting until I'm 26, because at that point, it's also possible that women will just think it's a red flag (""what? No woman has wanted him after a whole decade? There must be something wrong with him!"").

"Boyfriend wants me to stop stripping When I met my boyfriend he knew that I was working at a stripclub making very good money about two months into us dating . Now the economy has slowed down and I am not making as much but I‚Äôm sure it will eventually pick up again. I am 34 years old and still making more money than the average person in America . My plan was to quit when I could no longer make money stripping and once I found a stable alternative career. I am starting a small business and it‚Äôs in its infancy so it‚Äôs not 100 percent reliable to fall back on. I have never had an issue finding long term relationships and women working in my job are often married with families. Their husbands understand it‚Äôs just a job and men can look at  them but they can‚Äôt touch them. It is like being an actress . Their husbands don‚Äôt like it but I guess they tolerate it as there is a lot of pros ( the women make good money and able to have savings when most people these days can‚Äôt afford even an emergency fund, they only have to work a few days a week, and can retire early if they make proper investments). 

However now my boyfriend is telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want to get married unless I stop stripping. He has not proposed to me. I think it‚Äôs fair that I tell him that unless I have a proposal I am not going to give up my source of income especially since the guy I‚Äôm dating is not making enough to provide solely on his income alone. He has a good pension but his income is not great. I have bills to pay and have some health issues with medical expenses . I think this is a fair compromise . Either that or I tell him that I‚Äôm going to continue stripping and he can leave the relationship if he wants to, as I was doing this when we met and I actually find it offensive that he thinks he can ask me to change my job now at this time. He says that my job is not good for my mental health . And I totally agree, a lot of the men have to be asked to leave for saying inappropriate things or trying to touch the dancers. However, there are a lot of jobs where people don‚Äôt feel great about what they do for a living and they keep going because they have bills to pay . I am also preparing to make an exit but not until I am financially secure with another job or business . Is what I am asking a fair compromise , or should I just move on ? I know Reddit loves to tell people to break up too, so if you think I should move on please say why.

"IMO being emotionally mature and open is actually a detriment to dating now I'm someone who is now (wasn't always for sure) very comfortable with themselves and I do not mind being open and honest with people. 

I understand the whole oversharing and being too intense at first meet can be a huge problem, but this is not what i'm talking about. 

I mean like weeks into dating, being open about what your expectations are with someone, sharing that you really care about them and being open about your feelings. Again, this is like 5th-10th date i'm talking about.

90% of the time I get completely ghosted after. 

It's really my opinion that if you are emotionally mature and open and honest, you are in the minority of people these days in the dating scene, and doing such makes people who are not extremely uncomfortable, lesser than you, and brings up emotions they don't want to deal with. 

I am probably chasing after the wrong type of person, but its really been my experience lately with most of my attempts at dating.

"Advice for Finding Someone as a Sober Introvert Hey folks, just gonna start by saying the default ""do more of what you like and you'll find someone"" advice isn't going to help here, cause what I like doing doesn't involve meeting new people (not that I hate meeting new people, my hobbies just don't encourage that).

For some context, I'm an introvert that recently started using dating apps to try to find someone cause I'm in a new city with no family nearby and I've been single for over 6 years, that makes life pretty lonely. I really hate using the dating apps because they make me feel judgy and wreck my self-esteem because I've not been having any success. I get likes pretty regularly, but they are almost exclusively from people I don't find attractive and on the few matches I do get the conversation goes nowhere and the one first date I went on went nowhere, no spark. I'm generally a pretty dry texter so I think I make pretty poor first impressions over text. I'm much more engaging in real life, so I need to find a way to use that.

I don't drink, so bars aren't an option, and I don't generally like going out to meet new people, but I know I have to if I want to start dating anyone. So my question is pretty simple, what can I start doing other than going to bars where asking someone out isn't frowned upon or weird? Again, the normal ""do what you like"" advice just doesn't make sense for me and I have no real hobbies that involve group interaction (with new people).

"Just turned 29 and I'm honestly terrified I won't find anyone I broke up with my last GF almost 3 years ago and since then dating has been extremely unpleasant.

I've always wanted to have my own family and I actually thought it would happen way earlier, but I keep having shit luck at dating.

"How to tell a girl that I don't want to continue seeing her if she doesn't want to commit? **EDIT: I realize now that the title is a bit misleading. To tell her I don't want to see her is one of the options I've laid out for myself, but if you think that there are better options out there, please tell me!**

Hi. I'm a 21 year old guy with who's been in a few relationships in the past. It seems that I've put myself in a textbook ""situationship"".

This girl (21) and I, we've spent a lot of time together over the past month. I've taken her on dates, been to her place, been intimate, etc. It's great. When we're together I can tell that we're both really happy. Her personality and physical appearance is everything I could ask for in a girl. I've been out of relationships for the past 2 years, working on myself as a person, and finally feel like I could be with someone. I have truly grown a lot and I feel like this girl is the one I could see myself committing to. It's something along the lines of... ""don't let a good thing go when you see it.""

Only one issue arises when thinking about this girl. After seeing her many times, I finally ask the question: ""are you looking for something serious or not serious?"" She tells me that she doesn't want anything serious at the moment. Pretty soon (November) she'll be out of the country for a few months and she doesn't want to deal with the long distance. Plus, I feel at the moment like she would be single rather than committed to one thing. I totally get all of it. I don't knock her for it at all. Initially, I was like ""ok, I'm glad we're on the same page now! I understand."" I was, at the time, willing to face the repercussions of getting into a casual, short term fling with someone because she made me really happy.

But honestly, it's been eating at me. Genuinely, the way she makes me feel is indescribable. I have seen many girls in the last two years, but none have compared to this. My brain is screaming at me. This is what you've been waiting for. Am I delusional? I'm so fixated on her that the prospect of succumbing to societal standards and ""putting a label"" on it is actually always at the forefront of my mind. I never really believed in this stuff. I feel like I'm going insane. But she really makes me consider it.

However it's not what she wants, and I respect that immensely. Pressuring her into a relationship is not an option. It's either, stick it out and see if things change-- maybe she likes me in the same way but wouldn't consider committing until later-- maybe I'll realize that this short term thing is what's best for me and my school/work life; or I tell her that if she doesn't want a relationship, then I would no longer like to see her. Because I'm now so anxious all the time about it and I could be digging into false hope that it could change. Maybe things would be better if I cut it off and tried again with someone else.

I would love to hear your opinions on the situation, and could use some advice from strangers. I really need to hear it all. I feel so lost. My head's in a thousand places. Please help.",ChaoticFlint,2,1690858974.0,1.0,3110,593,3110
"As a man how can you build confidence dating when dating is damaging your confidence So im M21 and i would say i 5-6 years ago i was somewhat confident, could start conversations with people would have a laugh be a bit cheeky and connect with people better overall

But whilst trying to find someone i found my confidence was crushed because after several rejections and no successes and added pressure from friends (im the only one in my friend group whos never been with a girl before) i felt incompetent in that area and that reduced my confidence and it had a snowballing effect on me, like now at a lower level of confidence its harder and then when you hear women say ‚Äúconfidence is key‚Äù is debilitating because i feel like how am i supposed to walk away unscathed from being rejected all the time. 

Its like imagine getting handed test scores for a math test only to find out you did far worse than everyone else , are you telling me youd not be less confident to answer a math question if asked in front of the class knowing you performed miles worse than your peers?

And for me its the same with dating as everything else in life you assess your performance and make judgments based on your capabilily. 

It got to a point where i feel so unsure of myself. Ive become very awkward and i only really speak when spoken to nowadays because i feel like im getting in peoples way or im being an inconvenience to them.

About a week ago I found a nice childfree woman my age not too far away, we spoke for a few days online and it turned out we had some things in common and some similar views on life. This is uncommon for me so I was excited to meet her! We had a date a few days ago and it turned out we had even more in common regarding political stance and such. She's smart, funny and has a communication style that I really appreciate.

On paper, she's great!

But I feel no romantic or physical attraction. Like, at all.   
I'm not curious about getting to know her more, I don't feel like I want to meet her again.

And it's so frustrating!Meeting a woman that is so close to what I want happens so seldom.   
Is this just what it's like to date as a 30+?   
Do I just need to stick with it to possibly develop feelings?

"How do I break up with my boyfriend peacefully? I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 years, but I don‚Äôt feel anything for our relationship anymore. 

He‚Äôs becoming a bum to me and even though I‚Äôve tried everything to make our relationship spark again I just can‚Äôt. We started dating before COVID hit and when it did we didn‚Äôt have much to do, so I would accept going to his house often. A few months after we got together he got cancer and fought it for about a year, and because of that we couldn‚Äôt go out or do anything because he could‚Äôve gotten really sick and we just didn‚Äôt want to risk it. 

Well, fast forward to about a year ago he wasn‚Äôt working. His cancer wasn‚Äôt really bad (we caught it before it had a chance to take over) so his healing was quick. This is when I started to think about the future of our relationship. He was not doing anythingggg. He wasn‚Äôt working, wasn‚Äôt going to school (I was finishing up my bachelors at the time) he would be playing on his PlayStation, would go out with his friends late at night, buy expensive parts for his car, but didn‚Äôt have a single dollar whenever we went out, couldn‚Äôt even buy me a coffee or pick some flowers from down the block because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time or money for that‚Äù. 

I hate how he would use his cancer as an excuse and that ‚Äúhe was healing‚Äù I won‚Äôt lie, it did make me feel bad and felt like I was being to harsh, but in reality I was trying everything for us, I would drive, I would buy our food and outings, I would buy him stuff and it got to a point where I thought I should just date myself. 

Anyway, he finally got a part-time job, and signed up for community college. I graduated from college and am looking for a job in my career. I started to think about our future and to be honest I see nothing, but then I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish and maybe he‚Äôll change. 

Should I leave him? If I do, how do I tell him? He‚Äôs very dramatic and cries every time I mention a break or break up between us, which just makes me feel bad and say never mind, but I‚Äôm tired of this. Will he change? Or is this just all an act?

Edit: Sorry if I sounded entitled that is not what I was trying to portray. Yes, cancer is horrible and I understand that what he went through no matter how big or small it was, it was bad for him, his health and his life. We‚Äôve talked about that before. I wrote this in a moment where I was contemplating to break up with him because of exactly what everyone is telling me here I guess I am an asshole for leaving him. I always treated him respectfully, I‚Äôve given him space time and all the above to make him feel cared and loved before, during and after his cancer. But I, on the other hand, don‚Äôt feel the same. Once he was all better I would ask him to accompany me to my events at school, parties, clubbing, family events and he never wanted or wants to. Which is where I think it‚Äôs unfair because how come I was there for it all? How much longer do I have to be the ‚Äúgirl who stayed loyal to him because he was ill‚Äù person? Like how long do I have to go through it for it not to seem like I‚Äôm being an ass? I understand though that I am being too entitled, which is why I will just let him be, and I‚Äôll make sure to let him know that it has nothing to do with him.

Thank you everyone.",Randomself0395,2,1690622263.0,0.57,3301,655,3301
"[Repost] (30M) I've never been in a relationship, which also means I've never had a GF, and I've never been on a proper date. Am I doomed? I apologize in advance if this goes haywire, I don't know how to write what I want to write in proper fashion or if it's going to come out right. Having said that, here I go... So yeah, the title is the gist of what my love life is like. I blame no one but myself. I would say from the time of middle school up until the time the pandemic really started, no dates/kisses/relationships/sex, also it didn't help that (among other things) my teeth did not look good. And for the most part I was overweight. Before I started working for the first time at age 23, I was a nobody, just at home taking up space and not doing a whole lot of living. So how would I get my fix if you will if I couldn't have a gf or have sex? Porn. I know, smh. Heck, I would say I still struggle with porn and masturbation to this day. There was an improvement in my life around the time the pandemic started, I finished my Invisalign treatment after 1 1/2 years. But I found it ironic that I was ready to show off my new smile and then the mask mandate happened haha. But yeah, getting my teeth fixed was the most important thing that could have happened to me, it needed to happen. From there I think things improved slightly, at least I became a little bit more social, mainly with people from work. And then, the best thing that happened to me last year, I met my best friend (I'll call her Jennifer (not real name of course) at work. We got to know each other little by little, and to this day we are best friends. At some point, there were times (not many) where we were more than just friends, we kissed, cuddled, and of course had sex. Even with us doing that, we are, and will remain, best friends. The reason I bring that up is if it wasn't for her giving me those experiences than I would be here at 30 years old thinking to myself when is this this this and this going to happen. I could never repay her for what she did for me, she didn't have to do that, but she wanted to give me for the first time in my life a taste of what I want in my love life, when it comes to the physical stuff, the dating/relationship stuff is a whole other thing. Am I lost cause? Am I loser? Has the ship sailed for me? Is there a woman that would want me even when I improve myself? I would appreciate all the comments and questions that I can get. So ladies, and gents, what say you?

"Is it unreasonable to expect your partner not to curse at you during an argument? 24F and 31M I've (24F) had a rocky online relationship with a man (31M) for a little over a month. Although it's been just a little over a month, it has felt super rocky with high highs and very low lows.  
  
  
  
I broke up with him today after he said ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you"" to me during an argument over something stupid. I also blocked him. He found another method to contact me and has stated that this was a misunderstanding and that I'm willing to throw away our relationship over one simple mistake.  
  
  
  
My thought is, can something like this really be labeled as a misunderstanding or a little slip up, as he seems to think it is? I've been in emotionally manipulative and abusive relationships before, and it feels like he's sorta belittling how dehumanizing it is to have your partner yell obscenities at you during an argument. It feels like he's minimizing the gravity of his actions as well as my feelings.  
  
  
  
Should I accept that this is just a slip up? Or is his behavior a red flag for things to worsen from here?  
  
  
  
I will say that the reason things have been so rocky is that he has been pressuring me for sex and emotionally whiplashing me over my need for patience. He himself has been emotionally volatile, lashing out at me and breaking up with me only to ask for me back after he calms down. He seems to think that all of his actions can be attributed to misunderstandings and slip ups, but I kinda don't think so. He seems to think I'm unreasonable for expecting to be treated better, that this is just normal for relationships.  
  
  
  
Am I being unreasonable? Is it normal to yell obscenities at a partner during an argument?  
  
  
  
TL;DR: Ex bf contacted me after I blocked him because he yelled at me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you"" during an argument. He says I'm being unreasonable and this was just a misunderstanding and a slip up, and it seems like I'm just throwing our relationship away over a mistake. I feel like I don't know what to believe anymore, but I think I should stick with my gut.",ThrowRA90832932,2,1690694008.0,0.75,2166,386,2166

"I (27f) can‚Äôt tell if my partner (33m) is love bombing me or is actually into me 
TLDR; 3 month relationship, not sure if this is moving too fast, jump down to examples for context

I have been talking with therapists and they seem to agree that I have an anxious avoidant attachment style that I‚Äôm actively working on healing and was told it may take at least a year being with someone to actually feel safe in a relationship. One of my therapist and I talked today about insecure vs. secure attachment and I brought up love bombing and how I have had relationships in the past that were heavy love bombing in the beginning and very intense but tumultuous and short lived (ended around the 2 month mark every-time).

I‚Äôm currently in a newer relationship after my last one that was 4 years. We are just coming up on 3 months with a month and a half of dates/talking prior to making this exclusive. My partner (33m) is very sweet. He is kind and attentive, honest, and also honors my ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù and gives space when needed. We send a few texts during the day to just check in but see each other every weekend and our communication and comprehension is amazing. He has also told me he goes by a motto that if he‚Äôs going to spoil himself then he wants to spoil his partner as well. Honestly I have never been treated in a more loving way, even when we have disagreements- I love it but it feels scary to me because history has always started out feeling good before the mask falls down when I finally get settled into the relationship. 

My therapist sent me a link I requested to a website on what exactly love bombing is and I‚Äôm confused on what is appropriate at this point.

Examples:

-prior to us being exclusive when going on dates he did insist on paying for a lot of the dates but didn‚Äôt argue when I said I wanted to pay or split the bill

-conversations did not start out emotional/deep but slowly got deeper as time went on

-prior to exclusivity he got me a t-shirt and handmade glass cup I said I liked when we were out on a date. He had offered to get me more but I told him no, that was too much. He gave no push back.

Since the exclusive talk: 

-he has got me a dress, 2 handmade bracelets, and cleared my smaller wishlist on a cheap clothing site I‚Äôve been using as I‚Äôm losing weight 

-my car got broken into at his apartment complex and he called out of work to spend the day with me to make sure I was okay and got home okay after talking with the police

-my car was also towed from his apartment another time because I parked in the wrong spot due to no available parking in visitors and he insisted he cover the bill for me

-he sent me money to order out food for us to have a dishes free date night and told me whatever was left I could keep. I told him no I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and instead got us dinner with the money then used it to buy him groceries since he works 2 jobs 6am-10pm Monday-Friday and doesn‚Äôt have time or energy to go to the store. He never had food at his place so I stocked him up. He told me to keep the remaining for gas, time, and effort

-we do say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to one another already. The first time it was even brought up- we were drinking and talking about our past selves- he had indirectly said it (said he felt very strongly and gave me a look) and I said I didn‚Äôt want to say it yet because it felt too early but I understood what he was saying, a week later we were getting off the phone and he said it by accident and apologized but we have started saying it more often and open

-we FaceTime to sleep every night for the last month

-my mom and sister came to town and I told him we were going to go see a movie he and I had talked about seeing together but mom hadn‚Äôt purchased the tickets yet and he got them for us as well as got himself one. I had said I thought it was too early to meet parents but it actually went really good for a movie day (he just said hello and chatted here and there before parting ways right after). It impressed my mom and sister for sure. I have not met his yet and told him I do not want to meet them until around 8 months, he agrees this is a good idea 

-he tells me at least once a week how great he thinks I am and how much he admires me and goes into detail every time 

-he doesn‚Äôt try to control me/what I wear except on 2 occasions where I was going out in a short romper and the angle he was sitting at let him see too much leg/butt- he said it was fine after he realized it was longer than what he saw at that angle and the other day when I was wearing a sports bra and shorts while FaceTiming him and I guess too much cleavage was showing and I was going to step out on my balcony to bring my cat in

I feel like he‚Äôs a keeper. It feels good and easy being with him, and I don‚Äôt feel weird about any of it until I start comparing or reading into it which is Normal I guess as I deal with anxiety. But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs all appropriate at this early stage. And I also don‚Äôt want to self sabotage.",ThrowRA_ifeelsilly,2,1690586282.0,1.0,5013,993,5013

"Good looking and in shape but a loner will I ever find someone? Hey, so I'm a 31 male from England. I get alot of female attention in public but I'm an introvert so I don't approach women.

I try to connect with girls online but it's clear when you view my profile I am not popular and don't have friends. I feel like I've come to the realisation that no matter how good looking or in shape I am no girl I want will ever want me because I don't have friends or am popular. I'm also confident and went on solo holiday to tenerife last week so it's not that, I can make conversation fine I will just not randomly walk up to girl to get rejected 99% of time and hear ""I have a bf"" as its soul destroying. 

Basically I just can't fucking understand why these things are so important to the good looking women I want. Everything seems to revolve around what other women will think and its pathetic.

My questions is, are there attractive women in this world who will take a chance on the good looking loner or does that just happen in the movies? Do attractive introverted girls exist or is that also in the movies. 

Literally everyone in this fucking country dresses and looks the same. It's pathetic and tbh I just feel like dying now as I've tried with women but they just don't give af unless you got 10k followers, a group of friends and forklift licence.

"Casual Dating A Guy BUT He's Acting Serious - Should I Ask if There's Hope for More? Met a guy on Hinge and we've been dating for a month now. We had our first date - dinner and ended up making out and having sex. We both talked a bit before hooking up that we both had only been in long term relationships previously and were trying out dating. We both said we weren't looking for something serious at this point and exploring dating. I stated that while I am open to having sex, I also wanted to get to know him be respected and like each other. He mentioned wanting to know the other person cared. We carried on - having dates every week, dinner, talking and having sex. The chemistry has been really great physically. I've been trying to take it slow but he texts me nearly every single day asking how I am and sharing how he's day is.  
When I ask him to adjust certain things he does it and remembers it going forward - ex: asking for cuddling after even though he said he didn't even do that for his relationships (7 years) - but each time he cuddles me after and asks if its good? He has been doing more and more things for me - paying every dinner, pouring my drinks, bringing me water when I cough, being more gentlemanly and always asking me out/initiating conversations. I find it very confusing and think it is definitely making me get feelings because of his attentiveness + the consistent good sex. I am really scared by this and have considered cutting him off many times now b/c of the feelings. I am not sure if I should bring up because we had previously  already mentioned just keeping things 'casual' even though he isn't acting casual. And mentioned that I want to get to know each other and not just have sex which he agreed and said he likes spending time with me but also does want to continue having sex --&gt; confusing statement still. 

  
Out of repressing these feelings - this week I said I'm not sure if he even likes me sometimes because he's a very reserved person. He said like can be interpreted many ways and hesitated. Finally he said he likes spending time with me and also 'the other thing we talked about' (having sex).

  
I am also unsure of bringing it up b/c  because we've only been seeing each other for 1 month - though I really don't want to get more hurt in the long run if I continue to develop feelings even though I don't even want to jump into a relationship either but just want to know that there CAN be a possibility sometime in the future if feelings continue...

  
tldr: Why does a guy who agreed to be casual start acting like a bf? Or is this just how men can compartmentalize feelings and if I should ask him if there is any potential to be open to more in the future after dating for 1 month? Should I let him know I am starting to get feelings and am considering ending things if he doesn't have any capacity for more in the future?",Thin_Vacation_813,2,1690517349.0,1.0,2898,547,2898

"Times have changed, and id like to get some general advice to start dating again. After my (24m) last relationship Ive spent about 4 years working on myself, learning to be comfortable who i am, and trying to get rid of/learn to live with the baggage ive gathered. I wouldnt say im completely successful, but im atleast willing to try again. Growth and healing is fine, but its cost plenty of time and ive noticed an issue because of it. 

The issue is how much my own generation has seemingly gone full turncoat on each other and would rather treat dating as a means to an end. I know ive been under a rock for 4 years, but in that short time its almost become celebrated to treat your partner all kinds of wrong all while youre expected to take it not just by them, but society as a whole. It doesnt help that the criteria for what a ""good man"" is changes on the whim of whatever titktok these folks are cramming down their gullet that day. The expectations placed on people nowadays are seemingly WAY different and its like its impossible to approach anyone without seeming like some kind of creep or horndog. 

Ive tried a handful of times, offline and online, to at the least just talk with someone only to get ghosted, insulted, lied to, or led on completely. I definetly want to try again, as itd be foolish to assume that ALL women treat men like this. its just rough to be seen as some kind of predator or mark rather than as a man who just wants to cuddle and talk about his nerdy object collection.  

But even through all this change, i still want to find someone. All i need is a little help from people who've navigated this new confusing dating pool üòÖ so any advice would be appreciated.",PseudoGobbo,2,1690690831.0,1.0,1702,317,1702
What's the average guy's experience with dating apps? I have been on a few apps the past 3 months so far I only met one girl and that lasted for like a month.  I just kinda feel underwhelmed by the lack of options.  I usually get 2-3 new likes a week most of which are unattractive.  Is this normal?  I know girls have way more options and can be picky but it still feels low.  My friends tell me I'm actually doing good in comparison to them but I'm curious what you guy's experiences have been.,LeekLeading,2,1690849707.0,0.75,496,96,496
"Why do some people talk about their kinky dating tales (like how their first ever date ended into a wild threesome etc.) the moment you swipe them right on dating apps? So, there are some matches on the dating apps, where as soon as you swipe right, the person hints you about the questions you can ask to initiate a conversation. As soon as you do that, the other person goes like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a really horny story..very unusual and intriguing..‚Äô And when you ask them, it‚Äôs more or less like ‚Äòyou know we ended up having a threesome in my last date!‚Äô 

I mean don‚Äôt they feel weird to share such stories with randos even before a hi-hello?

Does it mean they are trying to initiate sex chats with you or trying to test whether you get offended by their stories?

"Taking a break from talking to a guy I really like &amp; really likes me while I figure out what I want I (24F) went on a first date with a guy who's just shy of 10 years older than me 1 week before leaving the city I live in and I told him about me leaving the city we live in for a few months to get some health treatments. 

We had made plans to see each other the day before my flight, but he sent me a text message the afternoon before our plans saying that he really liked me and is attracted to me, but was not ready for something serious, especially at long distance. He said that he still wanted to keep in touch and get to know me. At the time, I was like ""I don't even have the bandwidth for a serious relationship"" and we talked things out and decided to continue chatting.

We have stayed in decent communication (mainly via text &amp; voice notes, plus 2 phone calls) while he was on vacation and I have been recovering from surgery. I've been talking to him for about 2 months. 

Last week, we had some conversations that felt emotionally really intimate and I freaked out and felt like all of a sudden I actually DO want a serious relationship. (The thing is I do--but still so far down the line that I can't even see that happening in the next 6 months for me, I just didn't know it at the time when I was trying to tell him this). 

I sent him a message saying that my feelings had changed and that it turns out I actually did want something serious. Long story short, we decided to part ways amicably because I was not interested in being friends with him. 

However, I've been reflecting on my decision for the past few days, and I think that it's a good idea I stopped talking to him, but mainly because things were moving too quickly for me over text and I was afraid of falling for the idea of this person I was creating in my head (because of the distance, and also because i have more time on my hands to let my imagination run wild), so I cut it out. I find that I really miss him and I still want to see him when I move back to our city in about a month, and I am trying my hardest not to text him again and be like ""lol sike!"" 

I've realized that I actually don't know what dating is and what getting to know someone looks like, because my only serious long term relationship started after a 4 year friendship with a guy, so we became officially pretty quickly. I'm also realizing that I may be more impatient than I ever knew, because when I look at the situation as if one of my friends was telling me about it, I would be like you need to chill tf out you still don't know this guy. I'm hoping that I haven't ruined my chances of getting to know him by getting in my own way afls;djfaskld. 

I have 2 questions: 

1) in this interim time out I've put myself in, how can I really hone in on determining what I want? I find that the extra time I have on my hands is clouding my judgement making, and because I'm essentially in solitary confinement, I am feeling lonelier than usual. I will be resuming physical activity soon and slowly getting my life back together, so I'm hoping that helps. 

2) How should I approach seeing him again when I'm ready? Should I say I've been thinking about him or just ask him for a casual coffee and see how it goes from there?

She says that I have ‚Äúsexually blown her mind‚Äù and now she is keen to try loads of new stuff she has never done before with me. Anyway, previously we had both discussed that we were monogamous and we joked about not relating at all to the multiple partners / polyamory thing that‚Äôs popular at the moment.

We were doing a quiz asking each other sexual questions, she answered no to everything to do with threesomes / watching other couples / open relationships etc. But then it got to one that was would you try swinging and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd try it‚Äù which surprised me so I asked ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù and she said ‚Äúare you sure you‚Äôd want to be with just one person for the rest of your life?‚Äù to which I said well yeah and then it was just very awkward and she then looked worried and backtracked and was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm monogamous too‚Äù there was an awkward silence and I couldn‚Äôt really get her to elaborate.

"""dad bods"" versus ""fit"" is extremely dependent My actual question is what makes a ""dad bod"" attractive to you versus a man who is in great shape? Not a body builder. Not a man with bulging muscles or ultra defined abs. But just a dude who is in good shape overall and his body proves it.

WARNING: I like to write and get too detailed sometimes but like to give as much info as possible! This is also going to sound super narcissistic but it is what it is so judge me if you want! ;)

I'm curious because I, as a man (mid 30s,) have one which is entirely due to beer and pad thai lol. So I have a belly but it's not what you imagine. It's there. It's obvious if I want it to be. Overall I LOOK macular and in shape/athletic. Technically I'm overweight for my height (5'10"") but enough to carry a ""dad bod."" It's incredibly interesting how like 95% of women literally don't care. 

Ok, minus the belly/dad bod I do have a very very attractive face so that probably helps... But I've never had issues dating, hooking up, etc... with women who are petite, super athletic/fit, or skinny and objectively ""hot"" or gorgeous by society ""standards,"" despite me clearly being out of shape. I do have a very charming, flirty and funny personality so I suppose that also helps but, you'd think a 5'5"" 120lb super fit woman would want nothing to do with a 5'10"" 210lb guy who is obviously out of shape lol. Apparently that's not the case - at least for me.

I was blessed with amazing genes, both physically (especially physically) and mentally/academically - CompSci from MIT if you are - so, I've *always* been super naturally muscular and just have an ultra athletic build. Extra weight or not. I carry it extremely well. So maybe it's just my genes/natural physique, idk... but I'm far from in shape or ""muscular"" now but I still *look* like I am. I know that doesn't make any sense but I have a dad bod 100% lol. So I guess you could say a muscular in shape looking dad-bod?

Anyways, I have lurked on all the dating sub reddits here for a long time and one thing that people always say to men struggling with women is ""go to they gym,"" ""lose weight"" ""lower your standards,"" etc... which is always a GREAT idea! But, that's not IMO the solution to being successful with women. It'll likely attract more women but, then again I'm some dude with a beer belly and I do just fine! If I lost 10-15 pounds then idk what I'd do with women.

So, what and/or why do you like ""dad-bods?"" What makes them attractive to you?",Former-Corner-4446,2,1690342191.0,0.75,2504,467,2504

"How To Date in Career Limbo? For context I am a 23 yr old who graduated college last year, casually ""dated"" in the past, but no long term relationships. In general I have not been focused on finding a partner as I was always busy with the pre-med-life. I applied to med school last year, and received no acceptances, I plan to apply again and I would be 25 by the time I start. I feel pretty insecure about my situation, which comes from a lot of internal feelings of failure and anxiety regarding med school and my place in the future due to the uncertainty that comes with applying.

I feel like it's affecting me and how I feel in regards to dating. In general I find it hard to get past this idea that someone would find me a suitable partner, when many individuals my age (and in my dating rage) have an actual career or are more established in life (or will be).

"Can't tell if he's an F-boy need to survey y'all on this guy I'm seeing tonight and whether I should cancel the date bc he is an F boy or keep it on:

TLDR: we had a NSA arrangement for 4 months as we were fresh out of serious relationships-  where we saw each other once a month for sex only. Then had a falling out because he left me on read and i got mad.

History:

* met on tinder (he was visiting his family), both fresh out of break ups. I brought him home because I didn't see a future with him but found him attractive. My first one night stand ever - total risk but it was great. Sent him on his way in the morning and forgot about him.
* he texted me a few days after wanting to see me again. Pursued me. I told him maybe. Maybe if it was a date. He said fair enough, we schedule a date.
* He cancels. Busy with grad school finals. 
* he is in the area last minute, we hook up again. I try and schedule a date, he says he can't do an interstate thing with law school right now. I offer NSA - slim pickings in my area. I was emotionally unavailable and i didnt care if he liked me. I was using him for sex as much as he was using me for sex.
* i stopped texting him first. I kicked him off my socials. The rules were: let me know when you are in the area and we hook up. 
* he does. unprompted one day (he says he will be in town the next two weekends). then leaves me on read and doesnt show up. 
* I text him that it was unacceptable. He apologizes - a lot. Then we dont talk.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months go by. No contact. he texts me. I ignore it. Another month later, he reached out again. This time i text him back, reluctantl. Ive moved near his area. He asks me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: after reconnecting, he took me out on two long dates the past 2 weeks. Kissed at the door. 

The past two weeks:

* he took me on a 6 hour date. a full tour of the area. paid for everything. 
* He sets up another date but has to cancel (only after I text him first). Sick family member, he sends me photographic evidence and asks me out for another day.
* I'm busy that day, we reschedule for the day after. He takes me to the movies, he buys me dinner, walk around. Dance. He walks me home.
* both dates I tell him im not inviting him inside. We kiss at the door - he goes on his way.

He hardly ever texts me, he doesn't ask me how my day is, he texts once a day, maybe a meme, maybe a short message. I text him, something i think is funny, he doesnt react. Sometimes i think its punishment for not being clever enough for him. He takes hours to respond to things but so do I. He is working full time.. At the end of the second date he brought up a sexual thing again and I told him it was out of character for me to have casual sex. Not something I was proud of. He asked if ""our thing"" was a sore spot for me. I told him it was - he apologizes, says its nice learning about me and he had fun.

My friend tells me to ask him out, pay for dinner. I do, he says he says sure. But now I think and reflect.  He didn't ask to see me again, he said my schedule was overwhelming but didnt ask when i was available next. why am i asking him out? is he fuck boy? should I cancel this date?",elephantear11,2,1690653124.0,1.0,3186,659,3186

Good enough for sex but not s relationship. So I have recently started dating. Went on a few dates with some women that didn't work out. Then I went on my last date with a woman twice and before I could set up a third she said she wasn't interested. I left it at that and moved on. A couple weeks ago by and I get a text that she misses me and still wants to talk but only as friends. I say ok even though I find it to be a bad idea (I find her very attractive and lovely) We hang at my place next to just watch tv and of course end up making out and doing some things. After she leaves she assures me that she doesn't want a relationship and we shouldn't have done that. She then comes back the next night for seven hours and it happens again only this time she cuddles with me and rubs my hand and lays on me afterwards. She even falls asleep on me. Again after she leaves and she says we are just friends and she just likes the attention. I asked her today why she won't see me as more and to be honest but she lies. After more discussion she admits she's not attracted to me like thst. I don't get that because then why does she want to sleep with me. I feel not good enough. It's really messed me up because I actually do enjoy her company and want more than sex. Im not sure if I should cut this off and stop communicating or just stay for now until she finds a bf and enjoy it.  I feel like I'm being used for the first time in my life and its a horrible feeling. I have never in my life been in a situation like this.

"I hated my first date I went on my very first date a week before I left campus for summer break. I met the guy on Bumble and after a couple days of talking he asked me if I wanted to hang out at his apartment. I didn‚Äôt think it was weird since his apartment was near my dorm and we went to the same university. However, I wasn‚Äôt able to go the day he wanted me to since I had some finals that week, so I asked him if he wanted to go to one my favorite restaurants nearby the week after. He said sure, and I planned a whole day for us. I planned out the place to eat, the trail we would go on a walk on and watching a movie afterwards. He agreed to everything. 
We set a date to meet on a Friday, a week after he asked me to come over. I was really excited, I did my hair, I wore nice clothes and wore pretty jewelry. I was also so nervous because we texted for two weeks and he seemed like such a chill guy I thought I might be too much for him so I calmed myself down when he texted, telling me he was downstairs, waiting in the lobby of my residence building. When I went downstairs I was immediately disappointed. Not about his looks, since he looked exactly like his pictures, but his attitude and mannerisms. I tried to talk to him, I started off by saying ‚Äúhi, it‚Äôs nice to meet you‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah you too‚Äù but he started walking away. I think he expected me to follow him, but I was the one who knew where the restaurant was so it was just awkward. 
We did end up walking and making small talk on the way to the restaurant and I asked him if he still wanted to the get the special menu item because I was looking forward to seeing him eat it after texting about it. He said yeah but as soon as we order he gets mac and cheese balls and fried chicken. He tells me that he‚Äôll pay for his meal and I could pay for mine and I said that‚Äôs fine, but then I remembered that I was the one who recommended to eat here so I felt like I should pay. We ate and I listened to him talk for most of the time, and eventually he was ‚Äúdone eating‚Äù. I think he took about 3 bites of his food and was ready to throw it away. I told him that the server could give him a to-go box but he said he didn‚Äôt need it and just threw it away. Wasting food is a pet peeve of mine and I wanted to leave. 
I was annoyed at that point and needed to clear my head so I asked him if he wanted to go on a walk. He seemed like he was getting restless and he kept saying ‚Äúmaybe we should just go straight to my place to watch that movie‚Äù. I really just wanted to go on a walk so I told him we could go after. We walked for a bit and he kept telling me what he would do with other girls he went on dates with, like sexual experiences he had with them. Then he asked me if I was on birth control or if I have sex and if I meet guys regularly. I thought these were weird questions because I wasn‚Äôt even on that topic. 
He decided that he wanted to head back but I realized how uncomfortable I was so I asked him if I could get back to my dorm to change. I was wearing a cardigan with a deep v-neck and I just thought I should change into a crew neck since it covered me more. After I changed, he told me we should start heading to his place to watch the movie. I told him we could watch the movie here, since in my residence floor we had a lounge area and nobody was in there. He insisted we go to his place and I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to say no. 
I ended up going and got to his place. I automatically felt uneasy. I felt a little better when I realized he had four roommates and they all seemed to be home. He opened the door to his room and it was filthy. Food all over the desk and ground, wrappers, notebooks and pencils all over. Nothing was in place but surprisingly, his bed was made. He laid down and told me to come cuddle with him. I felt very weird so I just sat up on the bed next to him so he sighed and ended up sitting too. He started the movie and he had his arm around me, he was playing with my hair and caressing my neck but I just didn‚Äôt like it. I felt his arm on my back and I felt like I was hurting his arm so got up to ask if I was. He said no and suddenly asked me if I wanted to make out with him. I said no not right now. He said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, I respect women.‚Äù I thought he was being weird because he didn‚Äôt act like this when we were in public. He kept touching me, around my thigh and shoulder but I made sure nothing else happened. I ended up staying through the whole movie and he made a joke at the end. I didn‚Äôt hear or understand what he said so I asked him. He just said never mind but he sounded angry. Eventually, he told me he would walk me to the bus stop. At the end I asked him if he had fun, he said yeah, and I asked him what he thought of me. He said he thought I was hot‚Ä¶ finally the bus came and I left. 
I decided to get off the bus after a couple stops. I walked the rest of the way and got back to my dorm and cried. I was so frustrated with myself for wasting a day that I could‚Äôve spent alone. I felt like I was baby sitting the entire time in public but scared to say the wrong thing when I was at his place. I tried to keep an open mind but I don‚Äôt want to see him again.",Rice360,2,1690331795.0,1.0,5199,1091,5199

But I also just want to understand what people are thinking when coming to the conclusion of blocking after messaging a bunch. I guess I dodged a bullet.

"Anyone feel like dating is too fast paced? I might just be naive, I'm 26M never had anyone (I'm quiet, don't like going out etc) and just got rejected after a couple dates and talking for a bit over a month, hung out a few other times.

I just feel like from reading lots of articles and posts/comments that people don't give anyone the time or effort to get to know one another. Maybe I'm just not a good people reader but I feel 1-2 dates is not enough unless of course there is an immediate reason to not see this person anymore. 

Another thing is the ""spark"". I feel like people are going around only focusing on feeling that immediate connection, looking for instant gratification and focusing on the reasons to not date them. Again, people have every right to do this but I feel dating apps/society/movies have given people unrealistic expectations of partners because they can just simply message the next person on their phone. But saying that, I can understand that people don't want to waste time. But then again, I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.

She told me she felt safe and comfortable and that I was a breath of fresh air for once and said I'm an awesome person etc. We had some things in common but she didn't feel a strong spark so we should just be friends. I respect that but I just don't really understand it. Like, why not try and build a connection and look for reasons to be with this person until the reasons to not date them overwhelm those. Try and make you're own spark and build your own fire, because I feel like that is way more beneficial down the track if things get rough because you can fall back on your core values of what you built together rather than falling back on nothing but infatuation.

That's just my 2c anyway. Maybe I just don't understand females or I just don't have enough emotional trauma to understand people these days and my soul is a LOT older than I am üòÇ I can say I tried dating once now so I'll go back into hermit mode for a while and maybe try again in a few years",Mundane-Astronomer61,2,1690772142.0,1.0,2037,382,2037

"I was happier when I believed I would be alone forever Now that I have that little bit of hope, I‚Äôve opened myself up to constant rejection and pain. 

This process of having to relearn again that I not only am probably going to end up alone and sad, but that I in fact deserve it too, is excruciating. 

Why am I alone? I am decidedly an unviable sexual and romantic partner. First of all because when I was a teenager I had a problem with self harm. Cutting yourself is about the least masculine thing you can do. Even if I stopped 10 years ago, it doesn‚Äôt matter to the people looking at me. I‚Äôve recently tried to cover them with tattoos but they are still visible. Before that I just didn‚Äôt wear short sleeves or go swimming for an entire year. Maybe we go back to that to avoid the questions. 

Secondly, I lack typical masculine features. I don‚Äôt grow chest hair or really much hair on my legs at all. I can‚Äôt grow a beard. My voice is disgustingly high pitched. It‚Äôs like a squeaky toy going through a cheese grater. People often assume I am gay. None of this isn‚Äôt going to change either. I‚Äôm 25. 

I don‚Äôt have the genetics to get some insane physique either, so even though I destroy myself in the gym, I can‚Äôt seem to build any visible muscle and still look pretty underwhelming. 

I get that this is a confidence thing. You can make up for a lot by being confident. How the fuck can I be confident when I have zero good qualities? How can I believe that I deserve to be with someone when I know they can do infinitely better? I like them, clearly I want them to be happy. Why would I want them to be with me? Thats not their best life and sounds miserable. 

I wish someone could just look me dead in the eye and hypnotize me into accepting that it‚Äôs fine to be alone and find other things to live for.",Oregon_reject,2,1690928195.0,1.0,1815,349,1815
"I (M32) feel uneasy about getting back into OLD as I‚Äôm feeling more insecure/unattracrive I started using tinder in in 2020, and for a year + or so I went on a lot of dates, like a lot. No struggles getting dates but it went just ok, a lot of 1st dates and some second dates, and the occasional 3rd date. 
 I felt more or less confident and I had no issues getting matches at all. I had pretty good photos, probably too good as I picked the best ones of me, which were a little too good compared to irl. Some were 2-3 years old. 

Fast forward to today, I have removed or replaced most of the photos to more recent ones. Photos that are ok but probably not as attractive as the previous ones, and I can tell it‚Äôs a lot harder to get matches for the past few months. Dating on the apps is really superficial, I‚Äôm aware of it and it sucks. Doubly so as I also want to date someone I find attractive.

The reality now is that I‚Äôm balding and it obviously changes a lot in term of looks. I‚Äôm not feeling very confident about my looks anymore and I don‚Äôt know how to tackle it. I‚Äôm not really living up to how I used to look anymore. Definitely feel like my looks faded.

"What do I do when I‚Äôm the problem? I‚Äôm 22F and have been with my 22M boyfriend for about a year and a half. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs, but are doing very well at the moment. The problem, though, is that the majority (90%+) of these ‚Äúups and downs‚Äù/ arguments / any general relationship unpleasantness comes as a result of my mental health problems. 

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and am prone to anxiety attacks and overstimulation that often cause me to behave visibly strangely and awkwardly. I have a horrible tendency to get overwhelmed and snap at my boyfriend, saying things to him in the moment that I know are unkind or uncalled for. I am also highly anxious-attachment, codependent, and sensitive. I am fully aware of all this, go to therapy for it, and am extremely displeased with how my actions affect him. I‚Äôve improved slightly over time, but nothing major. 

We‚Äôve spoken at length about this, and his most recent take on it was the (true) statement that relationships are never exactly 50-50, and that he‚Äôs willing to be there for me when I‚Äôm having a difficult time (which is almost all the time. We joke about wanting to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù day out without some kind of disturbance from my mental health issues). I love him and we care deeply about each other, but I‚Äôm concerned that I‚Äôm truly holding him back and he is just taking it like a champ in the name of being supportive in our relationship. I understand that he is not obligated to be in this relationship and that if he wanted to, he would leave me.

"Navigating dry texting after amazing 1st date I (25f) have been texting with guy (29m) from an app for about a few days. Conversation flowed well and almost immediately set up a date for early in the following week. We meet and things went extremely well, he was super complementary and mentioned several times that he could see this becoming something more. All in all, I think our date went incredibly well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, conversation over text has turned dry since our date but I had chalked it up to having touched many topics when we meet face-to-face. We had texted me good morning and goodnight the past few days since our date, but stopped two days ago and left me on read yesterday after asking how I was. He mentioned he got sick after our date earlier this week but had at least responded once a day to me which is the part that has left me confused.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing he told me was that I was the cutest thing he had seen all week ( in reference to a picture I sent him 24 hours before ) and how he was starting to feel better but spent the day in bed on a Saturday. I was told him about how I was at a concert and the act was running late and that I hope he was feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I would just let the guy just dictate how this will play out but that hasn‚Äôt worked very well with me thus far.  I‚Äôve never had a real relationship and I feel like I‚Äôve lacked agency in my dating life thus far. I've gone on other dates with guys but never anything that went past a couple dates.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don‚Äôt want to come off as desperate but I do really like him and don‚Äôt connect with many men this way very easily. I wouldn't normally be thinking about one guy so obsessively had he not been calling me perfect and telling me that I can delete my dating apps all throughout our date. Even after, he seemed really into me until our texting suddenly got stale.

I wanted to send him a silly meme based on our date/similar interest but now I'm overthinking everything based on a previous reaction to when I sent a silly meme to a fading attraction. I feel so juvenile and I don‚Äôt know if my irl friends understand.

I feel like I already know the answer but...any advice? Should I just double text him, send the meme, take the hint, chill out ???

"My wierd way of thinking Hi. I'm M26, I haven't been in a relationship yet but I've had sex a few times. When I meet someone I immediately think about having sex with her and how to approach it. For that I feel guilty and I just get down on myself. Especially when I want to make pervy talk about sex theme - I'm always afraid she won't appreciate it and she'll add me to her blacklist. It all makes me feel like I'm some sort of wierdo. Maybe its true about me. Sometimes I just think, ""She'll find and go to a better guy than me, it's hopeless."" Sometimes I don't know what to talk about with her.

And so I started looking for dating purely for sex, indicating it in my profile. Expectedly, the number of matches went down a lot. And even so, there was no sex with those who responded, because I did not meet their expectations.

"My girlfriend is getting more distance, how should I confront her about this? Some backstory, I suggested to my girlfriend that she should make some friends online (as she doesn't go out with friends) and she agreed. This was great, I felt happy that she had someone other than me to hang around. 

That was a few months ago, it started off with only a few hours a week, since then its developed onto a streak of days where she wouldn't communicate with me (except an occasional text every 3-8 hours) I struggle from Anxiety Attachment Disorder (I wouldn't call it a disorder but my therapists named it that so I'm sorry if I have used the wrong term) I have gone to various therapist over the past 4 years for just anxiety and depression in general. Just to make things quick, my father died when I was 12 and I could never say goodbye, this triggered something as since then I always am cautious about family and friends about losing them. 

Apart from all that my Anxiety Attachment issue is mainly towards my Girlfriend, she brought me out of a very awful place in my life and I love her unconditionally for it and therefor she is valued more than anything to me. And with that I become very clingy, which was okay for us majority of the time because she never went anywhere and neither did I. The issue now is that this Anxiety has come back from fear of losing her from distance. I don't want her to stop but it doesn't feel right to not talk to her for days. I know I am defiantly being overdramatic about this but I feel like a second option in our relationship, Her friends come first. Or at least it feels like that.

She is well aware that I have attachment issues and reassures me that everything is going to be alright which I dearly love her for but I mentally can't go on with this streak. It's too little time to spend with each other. It is turning into a few hours a week speaking which especially for me is way too little. 

I want to confront her about it and talk about it like we always do but this is different. She is a very emotional person and the last thing I want to do is make her unhappy. But for the sake of my mental health I need to, I don't want her to stop hanging out with her friends but I'd rather she spend more time with me. She doesn't realize this is happening but its been going on for a while.

As a person with this anxiety, how should I tell my girlfriend that we need to spend more time together and why? (Without making her upset and seem its her fault because it really isn't)

For awhile now, I‚Äôve been struggling to understand what the difference is between platonic love vs romantic love (which is odd to me since I can point out previous partners/exes/relationships I‚Äôve had)

"Ex - Physical touch Hi everyone,

so shame on me (f32) - I actually started dating a co-worker (m39) about 10 months ago. We don‚Äôt work closely together, so at least that wasn‚Äôt the issue.
Insane chemistry, great conversations. He used to tell me he‚Äôs never met anyone he was so compatible (on every level) with and felt so comfortable with. 
Anyway, shit hit the fan in his personal life. A devious ex wife, legal battles and their young child who‚Äôs caught in the middle of his divorce war and suffering as a result of it. He started drawing back, lost a ton of weight and kinda started isolating himself from anyone. He also apparently convinced himself his divorce is something no woman by his side should have to put on her. 3 months ago when it started getting really ugly he ended it with me. Told me everything got too much, he needed to sort out his life and just wanted a hard cut in terms of everything. He‚Äôs even actively looking for new jobs - almost seems like a mid-life crisis.
We ended it on good terms and were in no contact for the past 6 weeks. He was clear on not wanting me to wait for him to sort out his life, so I accepted his hard cut decision and tried to move on, even though I felt like we could actually be really good together. 

Anyway, after 6 weeks of no contact we ran into each other yesterday at work. We had a 10 Min conversation. He looked like shit, apparently things with his ex and all the legal battles and their child had even gotten worse. 

What really confused me was that when he ended it 3 months ago he tried to really get distance between us. Sometimes I even felt he tried to avoid me. But as I said, I respected his hard cut decision and just gave him the space he wanted.
In that short conversation yesterday there was no distance. He stood really close to me, almost too close. Suddenly he reached out and started stroking some dirt off my forehead. That really got me, especially as it was at work. For me being touched in the face feels quite intimate. And that‚Äôs definitely nothing he usually does, as in like normal behaviour for him. And the whole situation really contradicted the whole ‚ÄûI don‚Äôt want us, I want a hard cut‚Äú decision.

To be honest, I still have feelings. So that kind of got to me. And I felt like the whole tldr situation is almost like a mind vs heart thing. Rational mind: distance, I can‚Äôt be in a relationship. Heart: still wanting some closeness.

"Not sure what to do I (M33) have been dating my girlfriend (F25) for a little over 6 months. Background: we‚Äôve met each others family‚Äôs and had all the future plan talks. Just moved in together.

She tends to go out every weekend with her girlfriends which I don‚Äôt mind most of the time. However, last night was odd.

I‚Äôll also preface this by saying we used to share locations with each when going out early on and then we just left it on.  

So she went out with her friend (F24) for some guys bday that they both knew. I had met him one time as well, super cool gay guy. 

We normally communicate with each other throughout the night via text. Around 12am was the last text she responded to, I noticed around that time her location changed to a couple miles down the road. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it until she didn‚Äôt respond to me until like 2:20am. Around that time her location showed her somewhere else in an apartment complex.

She gets home, gets in bed and tries to go to sleep right away no kiss or hug or even look at me. I saw that as odd. I said hey I missed you, come here. And she rolled over. I asked how was the that guys party? You were there pretty long (she doesn‚Äôt tend to stay out at a house party that long). 

She responded saying it was it was a chill vibe but musty but didn‚Äôt say anything about going anywhere else. I asked where her friend was bc normally she‚Äôll sleep over if they go out and her stuff was here. She said she went somewhere with some guys and wanted her to come but she wanted to come home. Another note: my girl was super drunk

All these things don‚Äôt add up to me and then while she‚Äôs sleeping her phone goes off several times. I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to check. Some guy in her contacts named ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù has a few messages showing. I check her phone and it‚Äôs a guy basically texting her wanting to fuck. The message thread goes back to last Sunday, where he says what are you up to queen, I want to take you out on a date to which she replies omfg I can‚Äôt stand you hahah 

Then yesterday night he sends her $100 via apple pay and says he wants to eat her out from behind. She responds saying Dam he ain‚Äôt playing, and this was while we were watching that new who cloned Tyrone movie on Netflix.

He sends her like 7-8 more messages throughout the day to early this am basically telling her he wants to fuck her. She hasn‚Äôt responded. I also noticed she payed some guy Dom 10 bucks via Apple Cash last night. 

Sorry for the long read, but I felt context was necessary. I‚Äôm going on a trip to Europe tomorrow with her and I don‚Äôt know what do. Should I be tripping? And do I confront her? Advice needed

TLDR: girlfriend lied about where she was last night, acted ‚Äúoff‚Äù. Engaged in messaging some guy who wants to fuck her. Not sure what to do",TheSauceofMike,2,1690644821.0,1.0,2791,539,2791
"Is 26 too old start dating ? I will turn 26 soon and I wondered what people would think of a 26 guy who has no dating experience. It makes me feel absolutely terrible and completely ruins my self esteem.

The reason for that is a mix of the usual mental health issues (social anxiety, depression,..) and focusing on my career. Because of my low self esteem I have simply never asked a girl out (so I cannot even say that I got rejected.. because I have simply never even tried).

Has any guy started dating after that age and had any success ?

"I need advice from people on what to do I will make this as short as possible. I have been with my gf (22) for over a year. I (22) male used to have sex on a daily basis whenever we saw each other. A few months ago she went through something scary relating to self harm. I took her to the hospital. She has been better and getting treatment and taking anti-depressants. For the last two and a half months, we have not been intimate. Listen, before anyone says anything. First month I understood and just held her and was there. Second month was harder and we had a talk about it as its important to me. The last half month, she said and keeps saying idk, or I am scared. I reassure her it is okay and we can take it slow. She recently said she has no desire to have intimacy anymore and that upset me and it is partially due to the meds (which I fully get). But she has not kissed me, touched me, or done anything more than two times in that time span. I love her to death. She was in a abusive relationship in high school and it still affects her. I just do not know what to do anymore. I do not want to break up with her or pressure her, but I feel like an ass because my patience feels like it is getting to the point. For every one steps forward its one step back.

"Why would a guy say they want to marry you without actually being exclusive with you? Disclaimer: I have ADHD so I apologize in advance if this story is all over the place but please read and let me know if you have any insight! 

This has happened to me twice, at 2 different moments in my life‚Ä¶

The quick little backstory, I messed around with both guys (not at the same time) and we werent exclusive because it‚Äôs just not what I was looking for at the time. They didn‚Äôt say it to get in my pants because we were already messing around. Months after messing around they‚Äôve brought marriage up. I make pretty good money and they both know it. One of them makes more than me but started talking about getting married once I actually got the money making job, haha. So it felt like convenience in a way, but at the same time it didn‚Äôt since he already made a lot of money. The other one makes decent money and I‚Äôve been knowing/messing around with for a while on and off. And he said that since we‚Äôve been messing with each other for so long it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre already in a relationship. LIKE WHAT!? What am I missing here? why would someone bring up marriage without being exclusive intentionally ? Maybe they don‚Äôt want to consider dating unless we both go into it with marriage in mind? 

I didn‚Äôt think about the whole marriage proposals back then because I didn‚Äôt want something serious but now that I actually want a serious relationship, not exactly looking for marriage, but I do want to settle down with someone, this comes to mind a lot. And I‚Äôm trying to make sense of it. I‚Äôve dated men I like after them and didn‚Äôt sleep with them cause I wanted to take things slow and not give it up unless we‚Äôre exclusive. And it feels like it backfired because it hasn‚Äôt worked out. Do I have to sleep with men for them to want to be exclusive!? I thought exclusivity first then sex, maybe there isn‚Äôt a right order, every situation is different. Like now that I‚Äôm trying to do things in the right order, things aren‚Äôt working out for me? Maybe I‚Äôm just boring but good in bed? LOL IDK.

"Does being a virgin mean you dont know how to talk to women? A friend of mine who i do not consider a close friend because we just started hanging out this year wanted to go clubbing with me or going to bars. I'm 26 he's about 23 and there's definitely a maturity gap between us. We both agreed that we would be wingmen for each other going out. I've had no sexual experience in my life haven't even kissed a woman. I kind of regret telling him my lack of experience but I thought that if he's a true friend that he'd at least be supportive. 

We decided on going out to a part of town that we 
agreed upon and I told him I'd prefer a low-key place because I'm not really a big extrovert and I'd prefer to talk to people one-on-one or have a more low-key setting like at a speakeasy or some of the lower key type bars in town. He put a lot of pressure on losing my V Card and even went to the extent of saying that I don't know how to talk to women because I am a virgin as if it's some fact. I've explained that I've improved my social skills and that I've been practicing a lot of flirting with women. I personally don't think I don't know how to talk to women but I just haven't had good opportunities to have sexual encounters in my life at this point. I am a bit shy and sometimes I do put myself in positions where I miss opportunities to at least get numbers or express my interest in somebody. While I think I might not have as much experience as other guys obviously,I do think that I shouldn't be putting myself down and think that i can't because if you actually believe that you can't talk to women it's probably going to not go so well. 

I tried to debate with him that manifesting a sexual encounter with a woman is not exactly the same thing as talking to a woman. Obviously trying to gain attraction and respect the other person's boundaries and what they're comfortable with is the first step before trying to create a sexual encounter. I think this guy is more socially awkward than me though at times so I don't really know if he has a place to be arguing a certain point when I don't even know his own sexual experience. Also I think the point of going out is to have a good time , not to try to put pressure on trying to have a sexual encounter. If it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't.

"I stopped talking to him for 6 months but he hmu and... Ok so I've searched and searched on Google but I couldn't find anything relating specifically to my situation. Forewarning, This Is a Long Post. Ok so when I first moved to my new town, I (28f) ran into a guy (31m). We made small talk and then he surprised me by asking for my number. It started with him texting me constantly and always asking to hang out. I wouldn't respond much because I wasn't into him like that and I found it a bit overwhelming. at the time I didn't attribute this to anything romantic but as I started responding more and hanging out with him he revealed that he liked me. I told him I liked him as a friend and the next time we hung out he asked me to be his gf. I told him no but I liked our friendship so I still hung out with him.
He started to reveal personal things to me, like for instance how he had proposed to a girl in the past and she messed him over. 

Anyway I had been turning down his requests for me to come over and I told him I wasn't trying to get physical yet. But after a few more hang outs I let him miss me and that sparked something and we had sex. It was pretty nice, nice enough for me to change how I viewed him. He was also kind and generous with me. Again I have a hard time seeing romantic interest from men and I figured it was just a sec thing. So I always expected him to disappear. 

Next, he told me something that I found to be unforgivable at the time and I immediately told him we could no longer hang out. He kept texting me daily and I would ignore him. I would also see him around town and I would avoid him and not talk. I honestly felt like he could be a stalker but he never took it that far. 

Well after 4 months of not talking I heard through our social circle that he was moving to another state. So I sighed a breath of relief. Two months later I get another message from him and I decide to respond. Honestly from my post history you can see that I've been feeling low. But I also hold myself to a high standard and refuse to be with anyone just for the sake of being with someone. (I'm trying to wrap this up, I didn't realize I felt so deeply about this.) 

So we arranged a meet up and the connection was instant. We slept together again and it was better than I'd remembered. We spent the evening together and made plans to see each other soon. We ended up spending the weekend together and had an amazing time. The sex got even better and we found a lot of similar interests. I forgot to preface this by saying that his first language is Spanish and there's kind of language barrier but as I'm trying to learn Spanish it works out great. 

So the question i have is, what is happening here? I can't make sense of my newfound feelings for him and he's also not asking me to be his gf this time around. What does this mean? Also why didn't he let me go after 6 months of me not speaking to him. What was he holding on to. Any anecdotes, personal advice or stories would be great to hear. Thanks in advance.

So I (M25) got to know this girl (F20) from a birthday party a month ago and we talked for a bit (I assume she wanted me to ask her out but I only got the idea in hindsight). She left early but followed me on instagram the next day. I hit her up and asked her out to which she said ‚Äûyes very much‚Äú. 

Not going into many details here. The first date was nice, I brought a blanket and something to eat and we had a good time. We held hands and I kissed her on her forehead but she didn‚Äôt want to make out. No problem for me. The next day she told me how beautiful she thought it was and how she wants to see me again.

"Dating is hard. Especially when older. Even more so in the Midwest. I'm a guy in my early/mid thirties and man, dating was never easy, but it feels like it just gets more difficult. I've seen some posts here kin to what I'm talking about. 

I don't really ""connect"" with people that often. I can find people attractive. I've been found attractive. People have asked me on dates and I've had to be on both sides of a rejection. I don't know what it is. I guess I'm emotionally picky? Physicality isn't a huge motivator or detractor. Attraction is important, yeah. But I want someone I can really just ""be"" with. I don't just want empty sex. A fwb would be good, I guess. But even that can't just be only physical stuff or I'd just end up feeling gross.

I look at the dating market and it's mostly people who are into a lot of drugs. Or have several kids. I don't have any of my own. I don't blame people who do, but it's a big thing to jump into when you're not a parent already.  

People tell me I'm just going to have to date someone younger than me, but looking back at my ex... it wasn't healthy. I loved her really deeply and it just ended up causing me to start acting like I did in my early twenties with all those issues I dealt with. We argued often. We just weren't good for one another. When I think about being in another relationship my blood goes cold. I don't want to hurt or hurt someone else. 

Of course a lot of this stuff could apply to anyone, but in the US Midwest, dipping into the South, even.. well, most people pair off between 18-22 here and it's just like... what do I even do at my age? Should I just give up that idea of companionship? I'm okay alone and I don't need anyone, but I want the same connections most anyone does. I wonder if it would be easier to just close that door.

"My person I wish i have my person who i can talk to. I have alot of things going on in my head,in my heart,i've been torn between lots of desisions i need to take,there's alot of thinga gojng on in my life and i dont have anyone to tell. I cant just talk to anybody,i have trust issues.

I have this person (30f)i really like,its my 1st time to feel something like this.im (29f).i knew her from way back,but when she transfer to my workplace,we got close to the point that she wants me to share the room with her(seperate beds). She has a gf when i met her before but they broke up almost before we got close.
I never had a gf,never had a crush with a girl before,my past relationship was with boys,never girls. So you could imagine what i felt when i just realize that i like her. I became very protective of her,i get jealous when she started dating again. I never wanna see her cry . I want to take care of her always. 
She ask me before if im into girls,i told her i wasnt before,but now theres a girl that i like. I didnt tell her that it was her.
Now evertime she cries i dont know what to do, i dont want to see her crying again or get hurt.
I wish i could tell her how i feel,that whatever happens i will be right here with her,i cant leave her alone,i wish i could but i cant,i want to be by her side as much as posible.
Now i dont know if i should give her space or i shouldnt leave her alone,again someone broke her heart and made her cry,and i cannot do anuthing about it,its not like they broke up bad,they broke up because the guy needs to transfer to a new place for work(abroad) ,so its not like i can beat up the guy that make her cry,now i dont know what to do.its like my presence never matter.

"conflict arising when an introvert dates and extrovert...off my chest, and advice? I was gonna post this in AITA but I felt like I am the AH..so now I am mainly venting and looking for insights and advice

  
I've been dating this guy (P) for 4 months and it was his birthday this past Sunday. We went to a nearby town with his friends who I had not met before. There were 12 of us. Now I am an introvert and social interactions really drain me, especially with people that I don't know. I kinda despise small talks as well. It's not that I am antisocial; I can be quite social, needing to see people almost everyday and love talking to people, but in small dosage like 3-4 hours, and with close friends. Therefore, after a few hours on this trip I was just absolutely drained. P on the other hand loves socialising and gets on with everyone (which is one of the things I appreciate about him).

  
On this occasion, because there were so many of us. Everywhere we went we had to split into different tables. Throughout larger part of the day, I felt like he was not paying attention to me at all, he always ended up on a different table, or a different group, wherever we went, so I was feeling quite anxious, because I felt like I had to make conversations with his friends for hours on end and he was off catching up with his friends, bouncing from group to group. I tried hard to rationalise it as I understood it was his birthday and he had to catch up with his friends, some of whom he might not have seen in ages. But as the day went on, I couldn't help but felt more and more, for a lack of better word, ""neglected"". My rational mind tells me I shouldn't feel this way as I know he was there for me and he was just there with his friend, but the emotional part of my brain was just screaming, ""why can't he even pay some attention to me, or sit with me for a while"". I felt like I was just thrown into the deep end (socialising with strangers) without an anchor (him). There was a point where the group went to laser tag, and we had to split into different teams, his friends teamed up by themselves and said this way me and him could be on the same team. I was standing next to him, when he went straight to team up with other people leaving me behind without even talking to me or looking at me. I was really fighting an internal battle because on one hand, I felt like a massive selfish, needy AH who needed so much attention and wouldn't socialise with his friends, on his birthday no less, and also kinda a failure for not being able to socialise with his friends and be a good partner in front of his friends that he can be proud of; I know rationally he didn't mean to make me feel any of this, he was just too excited to see his friends. On the other hand, I felt like I couldn't help how I felt, and it was an overwhelming situation for an introvert like me, like sensory overload, and I felt I wasn't getting any support / acknowledgement from him.

  
After about 6 hours into the trip, at 3pm, I was already drained and kinda didn't want to talk to anyone. On top of that, I received an email saying I had been rejected by a job I really wanted. This was when he noticed me having a bad mood and asked me what was wrong, and whether I was enjoying. I replied that I was struggling to have fun, and I was tired and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I really regretted my tone right when I said it. Also I didn't tell him about the job thing because maybe I felt it was irrelevant, or I was embarrassed, but it definitely contributed to my low mood. He went suddenly quiet and I knew he was upset. But I asked him to tell me what he was thinking, he just told me he wanted me to have a good time.

  
We went on to do the activities planned for the rest of the day. It was good time tbh. I think he consciously tried to pay more attention to me, so when the 12 of us split into two tables for dinner, we ended up sitting next to each other, and then also on the train back to the town where we live.  
Once his friends left and we were alone though, it was obvious that there was something in the air, because neither of us talked about the trip at all, nor did we debrief on meeting his friends for the first time. Well, we went straight to bed. The next day I picked a time and asked him whether he had been upset with me. He said he wasn't so much upset with me as he wanted me to have a good time and felt responsible for it if I didn't. I told him social interactions just overwhelmed me after a while and it was a lot for me. And most importantly, I felt like for the first 6 hours of the trip we hardly spoke. I hardly saw him / interacted with him. He said it wasn't true (I concede he might have had a different perspective? but I really thought what I thought). I explained that even when I was at a festival the day before the trip with my friends, I still had to go off and be alone for a while because it was getting too much, and that was with MY friends, this time I had to make a lot of esoteric conversations with 10 people I just met, it was just too much. He went sometimes it just had to be that way, that we had to make conversations, and we couldn't just not hang out with others ever, which I actually agreed. I did end up telling him about the job, which he understood.

  
That was two days ago, we moved on, but for the past two days I felt like shit, because I felt like I ruined his birthday, we were so looking forward to it, but now he will remember not feeling good after I said I wasn't having a good time. I hate that I contributed to that. I also feel conflicted because I don't know what I could have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same thing happening again, because I know what I know logically, I tried on the trip to rationalise and lay out the facts in front of my eyes (that he was just too excited to see his friends, that he wasn't ignoring me, that it's normal to have to socialise in that way), but I still felt the negative emotions at that moment. Honestly, I feel like I failed. I knew the facts, I knew I should have been better, but I couldn't. And knowing that his friends are so important to him, I just hope it hasn't put a damper on what we have going forward. The only solace is that I don't think his friends would have been aware of my internal struggle; I did talk to them normally and they probably just thought I was someone that are quieter than the average person. Honestly they are all super nice people and I would love to hang out with them again.

  
I always believe it's good to compromise / communicate / find a solution. But when we tried to find a solution to this, we were both stumped. As I said, not sure what I should have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same happening again.

"Me (22M) feels happy but unsure after a date with female (20F) Today me 22M went on a date with 20F. We met on tinder and have been texting alot and talked once on phone for the past week. Today we had our first physical date which from my experience went really good. We had lunch and afterwards went to a park where we sat and talked, we clicked quickly and then talked about a little bit of everything even certain stuff that are more private.

On the date we held hands, walked around the city and kissed around 4x times. When the day was over and it got late we said goodbye and kissed one more time before she drove off. She seemed just as happy with the date as I was so I went home with what I thought was a good feeling (the whole date lasted 5 whole hours)

Problem: when I got home I sent her a snap and asked if she wanted to have a second date and she said yes!!! BUT... she then added that she was unsure of her feelings, at first I thought it was just normal since it was the first date after all and I answered that its fine with me if we take it slow but... the more I thought about it the more worried I became...

Between all of our discussions we had today I remember her quickly mention her ex (not a good sign I know but it was subtle and quick) apparently they had broken up around 6 months ago in December which is kind of long time to be single IMO so I doubt I am a rebound after that long time?? She also mentioned she had been having some short lived encounters with other guys during the last months that did not last, just as I had unfortunate encounters with other girls that did not click during the same time. 

So my question: is this a red flag? It was only the first date after all but I like this girl and I am not sure if I should invest more thoughts and feelings onto her if she can not (or do not want to) respond the same?

I could also be overreacting because she wanted a second date with me and I am pretty sure she enjoyed my company and I am still on her contact lists... I have decided to give her some space today and not write to her as much as we usually do but: if you were me and chose to keep trying to invest in her, how would you do it?

"Should I work on social skills before dating skills? (25M) With the help of my therapist, I recently discovered that I‚Äôve had issues with intimacy/connecting with other people for practically my entire life. I operate well in group settings and have a circle of friends, but I have never been comfortable with taking social risks or initiating conversations. As a result of this, I‚Äôve spent the vast majority of my spare time alone. There are several social experiences that I feel pretty insecure about not having done, like ordering from a bar or going to a real party, but anything relating to dating and romance is by far my biggest insecurity. I‚Äôve never even held someone‚Äôs hand, let alone gone on a date or kissed, and I feel that my understanding of how relationships actually work is very na√Øve and influenced by movies and TV. 

I know that I will need to put myself out there and get into uncomfortable situations to improve my social skills. I‚Äôm wondering, though, if I should work myself up to dating by doing other things with friends, or if I should try finding dates right away to gain some experience. I think it would be helpful to get a better sense of myself and understand how to navigate more social situations first, but I also suspect that my lack of romantic experience is only going to become a bigger red flag as time goes on.

Well the other night I slept over again and I asked her what the next move was and she told me she really liked me but because she had only gotten out of a 4 1/2 year relationship 4 months ago she wasn‚Äôt looking to jump back into one. I told her I understood and said as long as we still have fun together we can keep seeing where things go to which she agreed. Well yesterday I texted her and it‚Äôs been over 24 hours with no reply. I feel dumb for liking someone so much so soon since I‚Äôve been in long term committed relationships before but I guess I was just infatuated by her. Regardless it‚Äôs pretty painful right now and I guess I just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading

Update:

Thank you everyone first and foremost for the nice comments. She finally responded to me saying she doesn‚Äôt think she can continue things this way because she isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship but thanked me for all the sweet things I did for her. I think ill get over her okay enough but the feeling of rejection when all I‚Äôve ever wanted is a traditional relationship for as long as I can remember is what hurts the most (wife/kids). I guess I‚Äôll have to get back on the horse in time and keep going",Pure-Communication28,2,1690250877.0,1.0,1474,288,1474
"Should i talk to this guy again after he sent me some distressing photos? I hooked up with him after we met through tinder a few months ago. The experience was pretty bad, for a number of reasons, but after that we kept talking because we had some things in common and i overall enjoyed his company (we only saw each other in person once, after that i went overseas). He did like me a lot and even wanted to date but i told him no. I'll mention that he has a ""traditional"" mindset and tends to agree with stuff that Andrew Tate says, but nothing crazy.  
  
Why we fought: one day he was telling me that i need someone like him to protect me, and i told him protect me from what? Then he sent me some stickers on whatsapp, it was some pretty fucked up stuff that i don't want to explain or detail. He told me before that his friends are together in a groupchat where they send each other ""messed up stuff"", but that's it's not necessarily him who engages in that. Seeing that upset me a lot and we stopped talking. He said sorry and when i didnt answer, he blocked me.  
  
Then today he apparently unblocked me and DMed me asking how i am. Deep down i knew i should have just ignored him but i ended up answering him. Now he wants to hang out again...  
  
I'll be honest and say that i am someone that likes getting attention or approval from others, and i find it hard to let go of people even if they haven't been good to me. In this case i just miss having someone to talk to all the time, and i'll also say that it's a general ego boost since i know he likes me. It doesn't help the fact that i'm back in my hometown with no one to see and nothing to do.  
  
What should i do?",rockmeNiallxh,2,1690314387.0,0.75,1691,332,1691
"Confused Hello all! I just started seeing this guy. My stomach fills with excitement thinking of him. Can‚Äôt wait to see him again. It feels crazy, it‚Äôs so easy to make plans that are literally months out. I feel confident/secure with him. I am always so hung up on if he likes me, does he want to be with me. I have done some work recognizing those feelings. And I was always afraid to text first, I just don‚Äôt have that anxiety with him. I can text him whatever whenever. I can share deep thoughts and not feel he‚Äôs judging me. It just feels like we have known each other and natural.

My hang up- I think he‚Äôs cute. I think I‚Äôm sexually attracted to him. I say think because I haven‚Äôt had sex in 5 years. He is awakening those feelings. I definitely didn‚Äôt have these sexual feelings before on one night stands or even past relationships. What I‚Äôm feeling right now. But I am overthinking this part: is it because I haven‚Äôt had sex in so long- that I am just excited or is it him? I can picture sex with him and all the things I want to do and want him to do. 

I am scared of what if this works out? I‚Äôm scared of being hurt. But I want to be with him. Picturing future things with him and it scares but excites me. I want to know more about him. 

I worry I‚Äôm not attracted to him enough, I think he‚Äôs cute. But I think he deserves more from me. I think as time goes on I become more attracted to him. But is that fair to him? I know things don‚Äôt just all happen at once. It‚Äôs also very early in our relationship. We haven‚Äôt had sex, met any friends or family. I just don‚Äôt want to hurt him or me.",Scared_Recover754,2,1690917086.0,1.0,1601,318,1601

"Online Profile Advice I‚Äôm very tired of seeing people make the same photo mistakes in their online dating profiles and I often have the urge to help them but there‚Äôs not a way to give unsolicited feedback there, so I‚Äôll do general advice here instead: 

1. Your first photo should be just of you! And your face should not be obscured (by a hat or by sunglasses). People should be able to see what you look like easily.

2. It‚Äôs great that you have friends! But they‚Äôre not who the potential partner is looking to date. Limit group photos to 2 maximum. 

3. Photos of you doing fun hobbies is great! It shows you‚Äôre interesting and gives the potential date something to talk to you about. But you should still be identifiable in the photos. If the photo really obscures you, rethink using it. 

4. Have you drastically changed your hair (facial hair included)? Then don‚Äôt use old photos that don‚Äôt look like you anymore. Don‚Äôt have enough recent photos? Ask a friend to do a little photo shoot! (Might be dorky, but it‚Äôs better to have a fun picture of you in the park than a photo that‚Äôs 3 years old and is no longer accurate). 

5. I know it‚Äôs sunny outside, but unfortunately sunglasses in every photo means no one can see what you look like. You should be confident in yourself and let people see your face! Limit sunglass photos to 2 maximum. 

6. You don‚Äôt need to smile in every photo, but you should be smiling in some of them. I know it can be miserable using online dating, but let‚Äôs not let the person you want to match with know that you‚Äôre completely jaded. 

That‚Äôs just a few hints and I hope it can help someone. Good luck out there everyone, I know it can be rough.",Responsible_Rip394,2,1690255722.0,1.0,1681,312,1681

Before that, I was going to therapy. Quite a bit. For years. 

I've been rejected a lot. A lot but I absolutely know it's my fault and don't blame anyone else for my pathetic skills at getting girls. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore and honestly I can't even cry anymore...like I want to so bad but can't. I just want a girl I can have a relationship to invest in and have a nice family one day. 

What more should I do PLEASE help me, I'm desperate as hell to just be good enough for some girl...

"How should I approach this situation? So one of my batchmates from college just moved in near my house and we matched on Bumble. We never really talked while in college but I did have a crunsh on her at the time. But right now she didn't make the move in 24hrs and the match expired. Talk about timing being everything.

But as we were in the same college her profile on instagram was easy to find. Should i make the first move instead ?

Adding to the intrigue, there's a lurking suspicion about her profile's authenticity. Catfish tales are all too common in the online dating scene. I was thinking maybe I could use something I saw in this video , you know send her a DM saying ""we should take it of Bumble.""

I am afraid of the possible gossips in the back If I make a move considering we have a lot of common acquaintances ,but strangely, no common friend to pave the wayWhat if she's just as hesitant as I am?

But amidst all the excitement, there's a tiny catch - I'm not exactly a master conversationalist. It's nerve-wracking to think that after all this buildup, I might fumble on the conversation itself. But if I'm taking the plunge, I need a brilliant icebreaker to set the stage for a chat.

"Dating while trying to lose weight, clinically depressed, and tired. There's two lines of thought when it comes to dating and being happy. One is that you need to be happy with yourself before dating as it's not the responsibility of the other person to make you happy. This paints your partner as more of a supplement to your already great life. The other comes from Plato who insists we're not whole until we find our soulmate.

&gt;*Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature. Each of us, then, is a ‚Äòmatching half‚Äô of a human whole‚Ä¶and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him.*

With that being said, I'm not happy. I'm overweight, clinically depressed, tired, and unmotivated. Appealing to the opposite sex? Absolutely not, but luckily for me, I don't open with that on dating apps. I wonder, is there truth to Plato's idea of love? I would think so as finding someone to do things with would alleviate the depression and cooking with each other would stop all the takeout. There'd also be someone there to hold you accountable for your actions.

Anyone experience it firsthand? Has your partner made you a better person or were you already a good person beforehand?

P.S. I'm in treatment for my issues.

"29 and still single. How do I turn my dating life around? So I turned 29 earlier this year and since then I've been in a major self loathing and self pitying phase. 

For the longest time I believed (and still believe)that I'm too unattractive to date but I don't think that's correct. I have no facial deformations, I go to the gym regularly, keep up with my grooming and wear clothes that fit me well. I have a nice group of friends and hobbys. Also I never talked to a lot of women. So my only evidence for this thought are a few bad experiences in my early twenties.

I think my main problem (besides my negative self image) is, that I don't go out a lot. So I don't meet any women. But just going to bars and clubs isn't really an option. I don't like those places and feel quite uncomfortable there.

"Is two days too late to text a girl back? How does texting even work? Hello, good people of arr-dating. I'm back here for advice.

I (23M) ended up texting a girl (a few years older than me, F), who I think *might* like me back, over a work-related platform. She didn't immediately file a restraining order which I think is a good sign. Problem is, every time I look at the ensuing conversation, I get a different vibe from her:

&amp;#x200B;

Points for no:

* Our conversation is pretty impersonal for the most part, though I'm not sure how to quantify this.
* Her responses are pretty short and she's asked one question back so far. That was her one attempt to continue the conversation.
* We've exchanged a total of nine messages so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Points for yes:

* She texts back almost instantly. Every time. Even when I took half a day to text her back.
* Her responses are short but not dismissive. Seems to me that she's just a bad texter. As far as I can tell, English is also her second language, so that might be part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a pretty strong no to me. I've stopped bugging her.

However, I've been told it's common for some girls to not ask questions back and expect you to continue the conversation on your own. That's what our dynamic (which, I'll admit, is a strong word to use here) was in real life too. She's very quiet and I'm not. She hasn't gone past work-stuff, but I also never asked for fear of being weird. I've talked about my own life (once) instead and she never reciprocated. Again, strong ***no*** vibes, but people say this is par for the course.

I stopped talking to her because I figured she wasn't interested, and it's been about two days since, but I keep getting this nagging feeling that I'm seeing a rejection that isn't there. It's an old habit of mine. On the other hand, I don't want to be the guy that can't take hints. If she's not interested, I'll gladly leave her alone and drown my sorrows.

Even if I do text her back, it's been two days. There is no situation where that is a good look for me.  What do I do here?",Jazzlike-Manager-848,2,1690482275.0,1.0,2098,393,2098

"Dating app recommendations? Honestly, I don‚Äôt really know why I even fuck with dating apps anymore. Most people are fake.

It‚Äôs not that I have issues getting matched with people. I‚Äôm a young female, successful and decently good looking. 

My experience so far:
Tinder - I‚Äôve had some kinda success with this app. I feel like more people are looking for hookups though.. my fuck girl days are over lol and I want more meaningful connections.

Coffee Meet Bagel- honestly this app is a hit or miss. I met my last long term partner on this app and we dated for almost 2 years before realizing we wouldn‚Äôt be compatible in the long run. Haven‚Äôt had any success after that, just a lot of men in committed relationships/open marriages looking for a 3rd (I‚Äôve also tried this, not really my thing).

Bumble- never had any success with bumble. It‚Äôs been a few years and I feel like the quality of people on bumble is directly related to where you live‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm a traveling nurse and sometimes live in the boonies while on assignment.

PoF- let be honest, when has this app EVER been quality? Maybe it‚Äôs changed over the years but I‚Äôm not hopeful.

Hinge- has turned into more of a fuckboy community over the years. I‚Äôve had minor success with this app.

I feel like this hits the big apps but anyone have any other recommendations?

Hi! 

I (25f) have been seeing a guy (28m) for about 3-4 months now. Neither of us were looking for anything series. We agreed friends with benefits. Welll‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve grown super close and things are going great. We do date things and have a really good time. 

He is in a sticky situation because he still lives with his ex(their lease ends this month). He stays over my house probably 6/7 days a week. I‚Äôm worried that he‚Äôs just staying with me right now because he‚Äôs in this situation. I‚Äôve mentioned how I‚Äôve developed some feelings for him and he admits he does like me and cares about me but he‚Äôs just always been in a relationship and they‚Äôve all ended terribly. 

He just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship right this second.‚Äù Which my ex also put me through hell so I understand and I can‚Äôt imagine still living with them. 

Idk I just don‚Äôt want to waste time. I see posts like ‚Äúif he wants to he will‚Äù but after being through some traumatic shit I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy. 

The other night he was drunk (which I know üôÑ) and he called me and talked to me for 2hrs about how he wants me to be his girlfriend and how he wants me to meet his family but he just doesn‚Äôt know if he can handle another split from everything again. The next day I asked if he remembered our convo and he said ya some if not most.

"Advice for dates/dating I've recently matched with this girl on Tinder, we exchanged socials and started talking, immediately clicking and therefore ending up talking for hours everyday. We've met once already on what was supposed to be just a normal ""hanging out with a friend"" kind of thing, and we really enjoyed the time spent together. Afterwards we kept talking for hours each day and found lots of things in common. 
Some days ago I expressed interest in going on a proper date with her, more than hanging out as just friends and she seems really excited about it(the date is planned for next Tuesday). I take the excitement about it as her being just as interested as me but I don't want to mess this up by being too cocky or assuming things.

But basically I live in Los Angeles and I‚Äôm a regular at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood that I work remotely at 2-3 times a week. There is a guy that in the past six months, I‚Äôve probably seen approximately 4 to 5 times also at this coffee shop. He also happens to be in one of my favorite bands (fairly big boy band). I‚Äôve always thought he was super cute, but never bothered him at the coffee shop since he was usually just popping in and out and I was there working on my computer. Last weekend I went out to a club with a couple friends, and he was there. He approached me, and we were talking and flirting and really hit it off. My friends wanted to go to a different club so we exchanged numbers and have been texting ever since. He didn‚Äôt recognize me from the coffee shop and I never mentioned having seen him there a bunch cuz it felt creepy? I also never brought up the fact that I knew who he was already because I didn‚Äôt want to come off as that was the only reason I was talking to him. But now I realize it might actually be creepier of me to not have mentioned it, considering I definitely know who he is and have seen him in public multiple times. I feel like I messed up by not coming clean initially I was just nervous it was going to come off stalker-ish even though it‚Äôs literally been a huge coincidence. How do I bring it up now and not have it be weird or is it too late and I kinda ruined it? 

I would love to keep talking to him as we actually do get along really well and seem to have a lot in common and have been enjoying talking to each other the past week. He‚Äôs mentioned meeting up again this weekend but I‚Äôve put it off since I don‚Äôt really know how to move forward.

"Should I tell my new GF that one of my friends is my ex? I dated a girl when we were pretty young  13-14 for about a year. In it the relationship was a lot things, very few of them good. But in the end it ended in a rather amicable fashion.

We cut ties for a while, probably 2 years or so maybe less before we ended up speaking again over Discord.

That was back in 2020 and now in 2023 we're rather close friends, I ended up joining her friend group who, for the most part are unaware we dated. She found a boyfriend for herself dometime during our cut connectio  who I'm also friends with (and is aware of our past) through the group. And honestly calling it ""her"" friend group feels weird I'm just a member of the group now they're my friend group too. At the news I had found someone she was really excited to meet them because, well I'm advancing in my life and that's something we both celebrate for one another.

Anyway all this to say we're pretty close. But there's absolutely 0 spark remaining between our different partners. We both want whats best for eachother, support eachothers goals and dreams, share memes and laughs and jokes and reminicse about our childhood, entirely ignoring the fact we dated throughout it. It is merely a mutual, close, friendship.

Which is where my new girlfriend comes in. In a friendship where our past is still obscure to a lot of our friends because its ancient, dead and buried history, is it worth all the drama to even call her my ex over, childhood friend when introducing her? 

I want what's best for my new gfs emotional wellbeing and this is, unfortunately something I'm not always good at reading. The idea of betrayal if someone offhandedly mentioned we dated does make me worry about lying, especially because its not exactly a white lie, but I hear its a big red flag to be friends with your ex but I'm kinda in too deep to stop it now. Not without causing a big rift across my friends. Plus I don't want to stop being friends!

"How much honesty is too much when you're down bad ? First post here so sorry if it doesn't follow the rules. 

Thing is: I have only dated two people in my life. Both of which were asexual, which is fine, but I discovered that I am REALLY NOT ace. Like, at all.

And though my last relationship ended more than a year ago, I came to realise over time that this was toxic as hell (never actually aknowledging that we were dating, manipulation my emotions a bit...). 


So that brings me to my current situation. I tend to associate relationships with the absence of sexual interactions, which I know is false, but I've been kinda conditionned to think like that.


I DO NOT CARE about love or dating for now. I just want as much sex as possible, to catch up the years I ""wasted"". I want to make it clear that I don't feel pressured in any way to have sex, it's just something that is super enjoyable for me. Unlike some people, I believe hookups can be meaningful and I want to profit of my youth to live a lot of experiences. Settling down can wait.

I currently have one fwb, whom I plan on keeping having intercourse with, but for diversity's sake I'd like to find more people who are dtf. (Again, this is not polyamory, no feelings are involved)

Which brings me to my title: how honest should I be with people about wanting sex without throwing away my chances. Because I value clear communication and being on the same page, but I don't seem to find people who share my needs. Does it turn off people to say you're horny and just wanna get to business ? Do I have to present it in a particular way ?

(I struggle with guys who do this a lot) how do you know their eyes are open to really get to know YOU and not your body??

Friends: going back to when I said a break out with friends. I‚Äôve also been coming to the conclusion that distancing myself from all guy friends is because I don‚Äôt want to lead them on. Back in highschool I‚Äôd always surround myself with boys, only because they actually would listen to what I‚Äôd have to say and I have grown a deep connection with alot of them. But I don‚Äôt see them as more then a friend. However some I haven‚Äôt talked to since the beginning of highschool have reached out to my recently and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre reaching out because they want something.. ykwim? Do I just cut them off? See how it goes? (What I‚Äôm currently doing) or just ghost?",DragonflyCold3815,2,1690405773.0,1.0,1701,333,1701
"Work crushes? (Just reflecting back - doing a lot of reflecting &amp; evaluating - can‚Äôt take action but am making plans for if when I can in the future.)

Ok so, I was thinking back to work crushes.  How much if any action to take there or is it a no go zone?

It‚Äôs rare I‚Äôve had them as I‚Äôve mostly worked with women &amp; straight women at that but have had the odd crush. 

Is it different if it‚Äôs the main job?
Compared to it it‚Äôs a holiday job?
Or a once a month side job?

What would you do? 

Again, it may be me being dense, someone said ‚ÄúI know some good‚Äù (I don‚Äôt remember what it was maybe some kind of self help thing rather than an event) if you‚Äôre interested‚Äù

Should I have said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to know more could we swap numbers?‚Äù
Again, I assumed I‚Äôd see her again (I can crush on both) 
I really got a sense she liked me back or at a minimum as a friend but also maybe more. 
With the guy, I didn‚Äôt really have an opening like that, except for him saying where else he worked.  Also got a vibe from him too that it was mutual.

Another time it was a guy crush but I only saw him once a month.  I was feeling so shy too. So I talked a bit some lunch times and that was it.

And at the main job when it‚Äôs every day what do you do then when you see them every day even if it goes wrong?

I did date a couple of guys kinda at a work &amp; study place once &amp; sometimes it felt awkward if things ended? 

Thoughts?

Keep em separated?
Outta bounds?

Or maybe another place to find connections?

This girl (18f) I (21m) met from my friend group showed a ton of signs of attraction for me to the point my friend calls me oblivious for not spotting it. (Hitting me playfully, laughing at literally everything I say, bumping into me constantly, being extremely interested in what I say and sharing it with literally everyone to the point even I get bored of what I talk about, taking random pictures of me, saying it was really nice seeing me after everyone was done hanging out) 

I DM‚Äôd her on Instagram asking for the picture she took of me, and all she said was ‚Äúyeah‚Äù and sent it, which was nice. Only thing is that usually girls who like me have a much bigger response to what I say, but she openly told me that she doesn‚Äôt really go on Instagram that much anyway

"How to deal with wanting a relationship, but knowing you want to stay single Might be antithetical to this sub reddiy, but i figure if anywhere has good dating mentality advice it would be here.

24m, I have never been in a relationship. That is something I have wanted for probably a decade and a half you know, but no one is attracted to me, this is a big source of insecurity for me. I'll see a pretty girl in public, then just get so down and hateful of myself, it hurts a lot. I know realistically I could improve myself to a point where people might start liking me physically, socially, emotionally and financially, but I think by the time I am good enough I would be like 29, which is far to late to start dating you know. I know I am still 'young' and can learn, but the threshold I feel I would need is so far past where I am. By the time I am good enough, all of my peers would be very far past me. 

I realized last year also, that I value my independence so much. I have the freedom of disappearing to go camping for a weekend, I can spend the whole weekend just reading if I want to etc. 

 I logically I know I would prefer to stay single, I value my independence, and i know how much risk there can be in dating, but emotionally it still hurts, it hurts to be unwanted. I have a great career, I have hobbies I love so fucking much, I  don't mean to sound arrogant, but I have a lot going for me personally, but even with this the insecurity of feeling ugly and unwanted can kill me at times, halt my progress for days, sometimes weeks at a time.

I know I cannot get rid of the human desire to want to love and feel loved, but I was wondering if anyone had ways to mitigate that, and all of the insecurity and self loath that comes with it. I want to be able to go out without hating myself you know.

Also just a quick note, this is not to say I have given up on improving myself. I will still improve myself, I still study for my job and for personal joy, I will still lift, I will still try to improve socially etc, I just want to do this with the thought of wanting a relationship under control.",Stock_Accountant6356,2,1690597238.0,1.0,2115,419,2115

"Was He 24/m Planning to Cheat on Me 24/f 
Hey guys. I (24F) and my bf (24M) have been officially together for 3 months. I won‚Äôt lie, things have been pretty rocky but we resolve problems efficiently and communicate very well. Unfortunately, this event has strained our relationship to what I think is the point of no return. 

On the day of my bf birthday I had to work so we both agreed it would be best if he visited me on my lunch break. He texted me he was on his way, which normally takes 30 minutes. It ended up taking him an hour and a half. When he came to see me, I asked him what took so long and he said traffic. It was 11:30pm on a Wednesday so I felt uneasy but brushed it off. I asked if he wanted to get frisky and he declined, which again seemed odd to me. 

He had a new crossbody bag, which I asked him about and he showed me what was in it. I asked what he had in there and he showed me but refused to show me what was in the inner most pouch of it. He finally caves in and there are an old pack of unopened condoms and 6/7 condoms not in a box. I asked him about it and he said he was transferring everything from his old bag to his new one and put the condoms in there. He said he did not really think about it. I immediately freaked out and got out the car. We never use condoms and I couldn‚Äôt understand why he would put them in a new bag that he carries around all day. I told him I did not want to speak him anymore and went back to work. He would not allow me to go back so I had to run inside. I blocked him on everything. I ended up leaving work early because I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking and crying.

My male coworker was also leaving early and offered me a ride to my car.  I accepted it and as we drove to my car, we saw my ex parked next to it, sitting on top of his car. I got out of my coworkers car, went to my car and my bf was there telling me how he wanted to ‚Äúfight for me.‚Äù I left and went home.

I called him the next day and he was livid. He said I had trust issues and that I shouldn‚Äôt have blocked him. He does not like my male coworker and was upset that he gave me a ride to my car. Rightfully so, because my male coworker has a crush on me and tries to contact me outside of work but I keep things strictly professional. He ended up apologizing for having the condoms, telling me how I knew he had condoms, and that he wanted to speak in person. I agreed and we met the next day.

I told him I didn‚Äôt understand why he felt the need to pack condoms in his new bag and he said he wasn‚Äôt thinking and was just rushing to transfer over the items. He then suggested we break up because I‚Äôm toxic and have major trust issues. He said I was trying to find a reason to break up with him because I expressed I had some doubts about the relationship. We ended up making up and trying to make the relationship work.

After this, I found out not even 24 hours after our breakup, he slid in a girls dm that I had asked if they had something going on because he liked all her pictures. He also reached out 2 female friends that he has never mentioned before and let them know we had broken up. I had a bad feeling because these people showed up out of the blue and he immediately started talking to them, asking them for advice and falling asleep on the phone with one of them. I can‚Äôt be mad because we were broken up but it makes me uneasy. I also found out he told all his friends and family and they encouraged him to break up with me because I‚Äôm toxic.

My mind is scrambled. I will admit I‚Äôm not proud of my actions and that I am insecure and have trust issues that I am working on.

TD;RL: I broke up with my bf because I found condoms in his bag and we got back together but now I feel uneasy.

"Truly over dating and enjoying singleness I am 31F and split from my fianc√© a year and a half ago (it was a long time coming). In the last year I‚Äôve been on dates with 11 different guys, two of which became quasi-relationships but ultimately didn‚Äôt last. I have always been a romantic person and thought my person was out there somewhere (even though I am totally financially independent, have a good job, have lots of friends and hobbies etc), but after being engaged to a guy who put in 0 effort, trying the online dating thing for a solid year, and dealing with all the bullshit that comes with it (ghosting, being strung along, being dumped and then hit up 6 months later, etc etc), I can finally say for the first time in my life I do not want a relationship. I do not want to date. I truly don‚Äôt want to be anywhere around men (unless they‚Äôre a friend or related to me). The thought of it is honestly repulsive. It feels very freeing!

I (18F) met my current and first boyfriend (25M) on Twitter‚Ä¶ I know that isn‚Äôt the best place to start a relationship but that‚Äôs just how things happened. We are in a long distance relationship and text/FaceTime almost everyday. We haven‚Äôt been dating for long and he already told me he loves me. He tells me everyday, and it doesn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable but I don‚Äôt say it back cause i don‚Äôt want to rush into it. He told me he‚Äôll wait as long as I need, and it doesn‚Äôt bother him that I don‚Äôt say it back. 

 When we first started talking I would occasionally send him a ‚Äúnsfw‚Äù pic and even now I sometimes send lil pics. He did the same for me, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs one sided, but after looking at his following and likes on twitter i never want to send him anything again. After he asked me to be his gf, I stopped interacting with all of my male followers on Twitter (and I have a lot who are kinda obsessed with me, not to sound cocky lol) so it really made my stomach sink when I saw that even after asking me out, he was still liking explicit and nsfw picture of women on Twitter. 
 
I talked to him about it, without directly asking him to stop, he was the one who offered to unfollow all the nsfw accounts he followed because he wanted to do it for me. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want him to do it just because I wanted him to, I wanted him to do it because he wants to do it because why would he need to be looking at that when he has a gf. I understand if he wants to watch explicit videos, but I draw the line when it comes to small accounts run by woman who are posting themselves rather than big accounts run by anonymous people posting explicit videos if that makes sense. I am definitely holding back saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù because of the accounts he follows, and told myself I wouldn‚Äôt say it until he stopped following them like he said he would. 

Honestly everyday I question if I even want a boyfriend, but then I talk to him and I‚Äôm reminded that I really like him and want to be with him. There have been times where we‚Äôll be texting and out of know where he‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúnot much, wby wyd?‚Äù And it makes me think he is texting some other girl, because what he messaged has nothing to do with what we were talking about . I‚Äôll admit I have serious trust issues cause of my dad who cheated multiple times when my mom and him were together. So I don‚Äôt know if that clouds my judgment when it comes to if he is cheating on me or not. I really hope he isn‚Äôt, and I won‚Äôt ever ask if he is cause I don‚Äôt want him to think I don‚Äôt trust him. 

Am I wasting my time or am I the one with a problem? He is perfect on paper, he compliments me alll the time, tells me how much he loves and values me, makes sure I know that he means everything he says, and tells me I‚Äôm the best gf ever (I wouldn‚Äôt say that lol). Am I wasting his time? I‚Äôm scared to even consider breaking up with him cause I don‚Äôt want to hurt him or make him feel insecure. His past relationships haven‚Äôt been great, they took advantage of his kindness and how giving he is and im scared he‚Äôll think that im just like the rest of them. I really do care about him and I almost tell him I love you every time we talk. But I can‚Äôt help but hold back cause what if he does something to prove that he‚Äôs unloyal or faking his love just to get things from me.

There have been times where he mentions our age gap and it‚Äôs made me uncomfortable cause it makes me think he‚Äôs only dating me cause I‚Äôm 18, and I‚Äôm scared he won‚Äôt want to be with me when I am not 18‚Ä¶

I really don‚Äôt know what to do and I can‚Äôt talk to my friends or family about this cause they would judge me. Sorry it is so long but if you took the time to read this I really appreciate you and this is my first time using Reddit so sorry if it‚Äôs not perfect.

I seem to attract emotionally unavailable men and before I get comments thrown at me yes, I have done lots of self reflecting and have spent hours with my therapist to pinpoint what my own faults are in a relationship. 

I just feel like I keep finding myself in the same cycle of dating and wonder if there are guys out there on the apps that are looking for something serious. Or do I give up and try to meet someone irl? 

On the boat of wanting to find love, but have no idea where to look. Tell me I‚Äôm not alone.",Present_Act8457,2,1690438232.0,1.0,655,130,655
"Why do guys keep bothering you if they‚Äôre not interested? Been talking to this guy for a while. We‚Äôre both in our early thirties. I was pretty direct about what I wanted and he gave me a little bit of an excuse (just got out of a several years long relationship, which he did and which I knew) but basically give him time and he‚Äôll come around. 

After a few months, he asked me if he should start dating (the implication being, other women). I was like ok, yeah, sure, go for it, because I figured alright, he‚Äôs not interested, we‚Äôre done. 

Then like a week later, he tried to hang out‚Äî made specific plans. I agreed mostly because I was curious and wanted to see if there was even the possibility of a friendship there but I also knew this was his last chance. He flakes and spends the whole night texting me but doesn‚Äôt ask to come hang out. That was the final straw for me so I told him, hey, we‚Äôre done here, we‚Äôre not doing this.

He kept trying to meet up with me all summer, even when it was obvious he was seeing someone else. He was constantly flirting with me. Tbh I mostly ignored him unless I was bored/lonely enough to want to talk to anyone at all but I didn‚Äôt flirt with him. Every time he asked to hang out, I made a very obvious and nondescript excuse not to. 

Then the other day, dude basically tells me in no uncertain terms: I don‚Äôt want a relationship with you and I‚Äôm dating other people. I didn‚Äôt really react because I was over it by that point and had been for months and just went on with the conversation. By total coincidence I did end up breaking up with a guy I had begun seeing (compatibility issues) later that day and he put 2+2 together from socials. 

Ever since then he‚Äôs been alllll over the place. Liking my selfies and stories, then disappears. Takes snaps at the bar in my neighborhood, doesn‚Äôt ask to hang out, disappears, and then barrages me with messages once he‚Äôs gone (that I basically ignore). It‚Äôs one thing to still want to have sex but he‚Äôs not even like, trying to make that happen 

I was going to just be cool about it because even though he‚Äôs a total fukboy, he is actually nice and helpful when you remove the sexual tension. And tbh, even though he wasted my time a bit and jerked me around a little, ultimately, it‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äî he was flaky and weird, he didn‚Äôt like, cheat on me or kill my cat. But this weird behavior is so annoying. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to just peace out on him because we have a lot in common and he‚Äôs got a lot of mutuals with me and I could see getting past this weirdness but I don‚Äôt really need or want some dude flirting with me and trying to get my attention for literally no practical reason. So what the hell? I Don ‚Äôt even wanna ask him because like, why would I even expect a straight answer?",Jasmotron3k,2,1690430039.0,0.63,2792,535,2792
"Ladies, putting ""I want the bare minimum"" in your description on dating app mean nothing Just like the title say, I just want to give a tip to all women on dating apps. Please don't write ""I want the bare minimum"", not because we don't care about your preference/standard, it's okay. The problem is the ""bare minimum"" mean nothing, it's too unclear for us (men). 

The ""bare minimum"" can mean making 6 figures, be above 6 feet, etc. or just be kind, respectful and honest .

Everybody have ""bare minimum"" so please ladies, don't ask for the ""bare minimum"", ask for what you want in details. It's a red flag when you ask for something, but when we ask you what you truly want you can't give a clear answer.

In resume, it's okay if you have ""standard"" to meet, but be precise about it.

Recently I joined Hinge and after weeks of scrolling I found someone I have a lot in common with. My Bio specifically says ""platonic or romantic relationships are cool with me"" and I matched with this person not necessarily being fully attracted to them (because it takes me time, I guess you could say im ""demisexual"") Now we've been texting for a few weeks and she seems to already be interested in me romantically and I DO get a warm sensation and butterflies, I get antsy and flushed whenever she tries to flirt but I'm not sure if im feeling this way because im just excited to get attention from someone my own age or i'm falling in love. We also havent discussed exactly what our relationship is, her profile doesn't specify dating goals/type. So, are we just having fun? Should I go along for the ride?

"Seeing couples posting pictures together online, is it weird to ask my bf for the same thing? Okay, this itself might look stupid asf, but honestly I‚Äôm genuinely curious about how society views relationships nowadays. 

Me (20F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been together for a year. Both me and him have social media but we are not the type who post pictures or whatnot 24/7. For me, I post more than him and on special occasions or once in awhile if I enjoyed the events that occurred that day between me and him I would post it. Maybe one or two pictures (nothing extreme). While he, on the other hand, is only on social media for the memes and reels. Though, he does post pictures (sometimes) and majority of those posts are what he‚Äôs done on his own. 

Which is fine, but it‚Äôs very rare for me to see something that involves me and him. And when I joke about it he simply tells me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt post anything.‚Äù 

See, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it as much if that were the case but I‚Äôm seeing these couples who do post pictures of themselves together, and it‚Äôs not too much, but it‚Äôs still something to show appreciation for each other. And even when one person post a selfie or something their significant other is quick to like and even leave a comment here or there. There‚Äôs even some people that say ‚Äúif he doesn‚Äôt post you drop him because it only means he‚Äôs trying to keep his options open,‚Äù or something along those lines. 

I see this all the time, and even hear it from my friends as well. Before, things like this weren‚Äôt big of a deal for me, but recently I just wish for him to at least post something of me to show appreciates me in a way. 

I know this is wrong to say but I sometimes feel jealous or sad when I see my friends get this sort of treatment and I simply don‚Äôt. Even asking about it makes me uncomfortable and even like I‚Äôm being overbearing to him. 

A part of me wishes he would maybe comment sweet things when he sees me post something or even post something about us once in awhile, but I feel like I‚Äôm crossing a boundary and asking too much. 

Am I asking too much for wanting something like this? And is it normal for guys to not post pictures of their girlfriends? How would I even address this sort of topic without sounding needy?",THROWRA_082722,2,1690288986.0,1.0,2254,426,2254
"How can i meet women and, most importantly, interest them ? Hi. I'm 25 and lonely. Physically i'm average, the real problem is that i'm awkard and kinda boring to talk to 

The thing is, i'm not a chatty guy, at least with people i don't know well. Back in school/collegue it took me several months each year before i spoke to classmates regularly. I improved a bit since then, but not by much. I can make some small talk to begin a conv, but people just get bored eventually. I just don't know how to make conversation or make myself interesting. I spend most of the time listening to others. How can i even meet and interest a woman in those conditions ? I feel like i'll go nowhere if i continue like this, but also that my attemps to change course are futile. 

Right now, i have a remote work job, so i stay home most of the time, and a dwindling social circle from old friends. 

I just went to a vacation where you're supposed to meet people (and hook up are common), and i can make small talk during meal just fine. But it stopped there, i haven't made friends. I don't drink and i don't have fun in the night-club setting, which i feel is a strong negative in those settings. I don't think it's just a case of ""you'll get used to it"", because i've been on similar vacations 3 times and to night clubs like 10 times: i wanted to force the change, but it refuses to come. On this point i'm not pitying myself i just think it's not for me.


Hobby wise, i go to the gym regularly and take drawing class. Also there, i can make small talk just fine, but that's about it. And these aren't really places for dating. I started salsa class recently (but so far it's the same story). 
I also tried cold approach a handful of times, and it stayed consistently akward, i made precisely 0 progress in hours, i'm not getting better at it. But when i can't make normal conv to begin with, this was expected, so i'm not surprise or sad about that. You can guess how well i did with dating apps... so i don't really meet women

To put the nail in the coffin, everytime i tried asking out or on date a girl i got rejected, like 7 or 8 times (+ during the cold attemps). I know those number aren't really high, but everytime i try it's a kick to my associal ass. My approach is visibly garbage, but i have no clue how to do it",FireZura,2,1690586707.0,1.0,2317,449,2317

So, we decided to tackle this insanely long line for a ride, and let me tell you, it felt like an eternity‚Äî3 hours of queueing! üòÖ But in all honesty, I wouldn't trade that time for anything. We held hands throughout the wait, not just to stay together but also because it felt comforting, special and helped pass the time.

The real magic happened when people started jumping over a fence to escape the queue. My girl best friend found herself in the way of the fence, so she leaned back, and instinctively, I hugged her from behind. I kid you not, when she looked back and smiled, it felt like a million butterflies fluttered in my stomach. It was such a genuine and intimate moment that it left me feeling overwhelmed with emotions.

Now, I can't stop thinking about that moment and what it might mean. I've had feelings for her for some time now, but this experience at the theme park has only intensified them.

So, here I am, trying to figure out what to do next. Should I tell her how I feel or keep these emotions to myself to protect our friendship? I'm genuinely torn, and any advice or similar experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated.

Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I‚Äôve recently started talking to this girl, she‚Äôs 28, I‚Äôm 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we‚Äôre probably more friends than anything else.
We‚Äôve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I‚Äôm shy and I can‚Äôt really find anything to talk about that we‚Äôd have in common. She‚Äôs a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can‚Äôt be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it‚Äôll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,3,1690628051.0,1.0,1524,283,1524
"How do I date if whenever I fall in love I lose myself? Whenever I like someone, I always end up fantasizing about a life together where we live euphorically with no struggles, I don‚Äôt have to work a day in my life, and I‚Äôm happy every day. 

I guess these are good thoughts to have but the problem is it always screws with my head. I‚Äôll lose motivation at work because all I want to do is run through daisy fields, and I‚Äôll become lazy and uninteresting as a person in general and stop pursuing hobbies or learning to just fantasize for most of the day (i.e. loving someone becomes my whole personality). 

My biggest concern is that I seemingly no longer want to work. But maybe this is my inner feminine coming out and it‚Äôs a sign that I wasn‚Äôt meant to work? I‚Äôve been a workaholic for so long I don‚Äôt really know if what I truly want is to be CEO, but the minute I fall in love these workaholic desires all disappear anyway. But I digress.

I‚Äôm such an ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù better person in every way when I‚Äôm single- I am ambitious and successful at work, I have a variety of interests, I have a bunch of friends that I care about. When I fall in love it‚Äôs like a cocaine addiction and I don‚Äôt really know who I am anymore but all I know is that it feels so good. I feel that it is my calling to fall in love. I would like to have my one person so much.

And after some dumb decision making on our part, her mom went though her phone and found out we were dating. Her mom also happen to find some nudes of myself on her phone, for sure she wasn't pleased. She took her phone away (now she texts me when her mom ain't home). Also we are recent graduates, so can't meet in college and she is not allowed to go outside until her job starts. Her mom wants her to cut off any connections she has with me, block me and never talk to me again, and threatens to suicide if she doesn't cut off all ties with me. But we both don't want to do that. We still want to continue dating. I have told her that maybe I could come talk in person with her mom, but she says that it would just make the entire thing worse because her mom sees me as a 'bad person' now for sending her nudes.

"She canceled before first date. Benefit of the doubt or move on? This girl matched with me on a dating app last Friday. I responded to her message, and she got back to me Saturday night where I suggested we grab dinner. She said she'd love to, but couldn't do the initial time I suggested because she said the week is kind of tough for her to make plans (which was totally fine with me because I usually don't like going out on weekdays anyway). She suggested the coming Saturday, but today (Thursday), she says she can't make it because her job is calling her to work at the time we agreed to on Saturday. I used to have a pretty demanding job that sometimes forced me work weekends and nights, so I told her I totally get what she's dealing with. 

Basically on the one hand: she's the one who suggested the time for the date originally, and she gave me a decent amount of notice before asking for a raincheck. On the other: she didn't immediately respond with a concrete alternative day/time, but maybe I should prompt that for her? She seems like someone I have a lot in common with based on her profile, and I'm especially willing to be patient about things like the reason she gave because the ambition/career drive is a quality I look for.

"My(31M) girlfriend(32F) keeps stonewalling me whenever we have an argument/disagreement. It's giving me stress and anxiety and I cannot take it anymore. I started dating this girl about 3 months ago. The first month was pretty amazing. But the honeymoon phase ended way too early and we started getting into arguments/disagreements by the 2nd month itself. Whenever we have a disagreement, she sometimes gets agitated and starts gaslighting me. She often gets very angry and shuts me down by saying ""I don't want to talk right now"" and walks off. She doesn't come back until she cools down. If I try to bring up the discussion again, she just shuts me down by saying ""We already had a discussion over this and I hate going in circles"". Now this has happened way too many times for me to ignore. The inability to have a civilized discussion over any disagreement is giving me a lot of stress and anxiety because I'm being forced to bottle up my feelings. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her because I don't know what I do or say might accidentally trigger her and I don't want to get into fights every day. I have also observed that she just cannot handle losing an argument. If an argument ends up in her giving up, she tries to bring up something totally random from the past to keep the fight going until she feels like she has won the argument. I'm really tired of this and have been thinking of breaking up with her.

"He lied on the first date So I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for two weeks now (M32 &amp; F28), and recently I found out that he told a little lie on our first date. I don‚Äôt really remember much from this conversation, but apparently I asked him how long he had been single for and he told me it had been a few months. 

Yesterday we were talking about past relationships and I find out that he actually just became single a week and a half before we met. It was just a short 5 month relationship that wasn‚Äôt super healthy by the sounds of it - so that part doesn‚Äôt bug me at all. What does bug me is the fact that he lied about the timeline so the truth wouldn‚Äôt scare me off. 

I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs kind of an awkward question to be asked on a first date (especially when you‚Äôre as newly single as he is), but I‚Äôm looking for something serious and longterm, so I often ask serious questions. 

He has since explained the situation to me entirely, admitted he lied and apologized a million times. We have had a lot of open communication about it, but it still really bugs me that he lied. I‚Äôm a super honest and open person and desire to find that in a longterm partner as well.

"Obsessives thoughts and intense negative feelings after one date, am I okay? Hello, I (28M) am writing this because of a dating situation I just went through and would like some advice/feedback in order to alleviate the feelings of worthlessness I often experience after I am rejected.

A few months ago I moved across the county to a city where I know nobody. It's a great career move for me but I need to start my social life from scratch. I've talked to some people in my apartment complex and made some friends. One of them invited me to a kickball league and I met a girl on the team. She DM'd me via GroupMe a few days ago, clearing indicating interest. I asked her out the next time we had a kickball game and we set up a date for the following day.

The date was great, I had a great time and I am confident she did too. We ended up having sex at my place, which in hindsight is where I think I made a mistake. Due to insecurities in the past I do not have a lot of sexual experience. I had a girlfriend for about 6 months in college, where we had sex frequently. I also did some casual dating about a year ago and only had sex once during that time. Outside of those two situations I haven't been having sex. Since I am relatively inexperienced I think I may have fell short of her expectations.

I tried to set up a mini golf date for this evening, and she gave me a maybe, recently followed by ""I don't think I've got it in me tonight"" and no attempt to reschedule which I read to mean she has no interest in going on another date. Her best friend is on the team so I may ask her if I should just assume we'll be friends from her on out, but I am for sure getting the vibe that she doesn't want to see me again. 

Ever since our first date (Tuesday) I have been thinking about her nonstop, obsessing over whether or not she wants to see me again. When she finally gave me the bad news I felt like I didn't want to live anymore. I am just crushed. A big part of the reason I am so inexperienced in dating and sex is because of the intense feelings this sort of rejection would induce in the past. 

I know it's perfectly normal to be upset in this situation, but I would really, really like to stop the obsessive, intrusive thoughts. I don't think its normal. It's only been one date and I can hardly focus at work. I go to bed and wake up thinking about her. She's on my mind when I am working out, watching TV, and playing video games with my friends. I feel like a desperate loser for putting this much attention and emotional energy into a person that I barely know. We get along and had one good date and we had sex once. That's it.

I have a great career, I am fit, and I am successfully developing a social life in a cool city where I don't know anyone. On paper, these things seem like a great successes and I should be proud of myself. On the inside I continue to feel desperate and unlovable. I can't seem to help but allow women to dictate my self-worth and command my attention. I tell myself that I shouldn't let somebody I hardly know control my self esteem, but my brain continues to obsess and I don't know how to make it stop.

Is this a common experience or am I mentally ill? Does anyone have any advice for me? Am I a complete moron for sleeping with her on the first date? I probably should have focused on developing an emotional connection first given that it's unlikely I'll be able to blow her mind in the bedroom without more experience. Is it always a bad idea to have sex on date #1 if you think you want a deeper connection?

Any advice is appreciated. I am happy to provide more information if it would help. Thanks for reading.

"Am I too much of a red flag now? I've (M49) never had much luck with women. As a teenager and in my twenties, I was overweight, shy and distinctly average-looking amongst my peers and I kind of had the confidence to date sapped from me.
 In my thirties, I lost a little weight, socialized more (went to Uni) gained a sense of confidence but again, outside of a few drunken hook-ups, I was again that guy that seemingly wasn't anyone's particular cup of tea.
In my forties, my career has progressed well, I've got a good group of friends and enjoy life. I made a concerted effort to date in my early forties through various OLD platforms but nothing happened. During this, admittedly, I wasn't in the best shape but my now ageing average looks and my inability to make a connection and dating inexperience, was again hamstringing me.
Now I'm approaching my 50th next year and although I'm pretty much at peace with probably never having a family, it would be still nice to find someone to share my life with. I'm doubling down my efforts to improve my weight and fitness, but I feel my non-existent relationship past has made me a walking red flag with women. It would be interesting to hear from women around my age (and anyone else) whether my fears are well-founded and I should quit while I'm ahead or whether there's any hope for me. TIA

"I accidentally turned someone off We were doing okay. We dated 4 times in a span of 3 months because I was 4 hours away from her. I think I blew it. We were always chatting and laughing in chat. We were okay as well when in person. At least for me I don't know about her.

Anyways long story short. I think I blew it. I am not sure if I said something or did something. But I have my theories. Maybe I should not have found an excuse to touch her hand. Maybe I should not have said things like how are we or does she see any red flags or overexplained things.

There was this one time where she said she wanted to skip dinner. I said it's alright but on the 3rd time she said sorry I said ""promise it's okay. Who am I to complain (laughing emoji).

All these bad things happened in 1 day. Maybe she got turned off by taking candid picture of her or I wasn't confident in my answers or she didn't like how I think. Or maybe it was my outfit she didn't like. All I know is all this thing I am saying happened in the last date. I should have been more mindful.

"Was I overdramatic in giving an ultimatum before we even met? Man there really is no guidebook to dating, I don't know what I'm doing at all. 25 F.

I matched with this guy about 3 weeks ago on Tinder, he gave me his snap and number after a couple days and we've been chatting most days since then. Nothing too deep (thought I should leave most of the getting-to-know stuff for the first date), but we have lots of interests in common and talked a lot about video games, DnD, work, and just how are days and weekends have been going, very surface level but he seemed interested enough. Even brought up doing a one-shot DnD campaign with me to show me the ropes as I haven't played much. We had made plans about a week ago to meet up this past Thursday somewhere halfway between us, and he seemed down for it, although maybe slightly apprehensive. 

An hour before I was planning on leaving on Thursday, he messaged saying he had to cancel to go to the Dr for a rash, apologized, and said he'd like to reschedule for the weekend. I made a mistake here in not asking for specifics, and I just said I totally understand, would totally be down for either day this weekend. We chatted maybe once or twice a day since then, I asked how his skin has been healing and he said it's getting better. I considered being more direct about what day and time we could meet but I felt since he was the one who cancelled and is healing, that he would let me know. 

This is where I think I fucked up. He didn't open my message from yesterday all day today (it's now Sunday, the weekend has come and passed, no mention of pushing the date further into the week or anything; he suggested the weekend, never followed up). I don't feel like playing a guessing game or continuing on just surface level chatting with a stranger, so I send him a very kind message just basically saying ""hope you're healing well, wanna let you know I'm leaving it up to you if we meet, I'm still interested but am looking to meet people irl, so if it won't happen or you're not interested I'll be saying farewell. No hard feeling or pressure, just wanted to be straightforward with you."" He opened this a couple hours ago and hasn't responded.

"How do you think rationally / know when to pump the brakes when a potential relationship is going really well? Hello! I am pleased to be asking such a question! Background: I (25M) have been texting a girl (24F) for about 6 weeks and we started going on dates 3 weeks ago. I met her at a party I hosted through a mutual friend and we hit it off really well, she asked for my number, and we started chatting. I usually am quite analytical and calculated, but this time things feel very different. We both immediately felt a good chemistry, can talk for hours, enjoy each other's company, text / call often, etc. The sex is also incredible and includes lots of laughter and comfortable communication. 

We both have acknowledged that we want to date, and she's even said ""tell me when you're ready, because I want to be with you"". This is really sweet and I would even go as far to say that she could be the one. We have similar life / family goals, similar humors, share similar careers, and just vibe really well together. I have told her that I want us to really flesh out the details of a relationship before being official and she thinks that's wise. 

That being said, I have two questions really:

1. How do you personally determine if someone is really the one / would be a great partner without letting yourself get too excited?
2. What goals would you like to achieve before officially dating? (I.e. convos about the future? Hanging with friends first?) 

Bottom line: I really like this girl, she really likes me and I have really good feelings about the potential here but I don't want to put the cart before the horse and ruin a potentially healthy, satisfying relationship. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated! :) ",Alternative-Steak503,3,1690599415.0,1.0,1727,311,1727
"First dates I've recently decided that I really want a long term relationship instead of just casual whatever or one night stands. So, I've been going on a lot of first dates lately but it's been weighing on me. I want to find ""the one"" and I have a clear idea of what I want, so I've been ending a lot of dates by saying some version of ""I had a really nice time but this isn't for me"". I know this is probably a stupid question but should I feel bad doing it this way? Should I let them text me afterwards and then tell them? I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but if I don't want to see them again, I definitely know by the end of the first date.",strawberry__rhubarb,3,1690618271.0,1.0,653,133,653
"How do I give green light to be approached (according to the western expectations)? I (20F) come from a more conservative country and am used to guys being aggressive and insistent in their approach to dating and girls dressing nice, taking care of their appearance and waiting to be chosen. Therefore I still struggle to adapt to the western dating style. 

I've been told by my friends that guys rarely approach me because I don't signal to them in any way that I want to be approached. Now, first of all, that presents a logical fallacy: if I signal interest to a guy and he takes the bait, doesn't that mean he approaches me because he thinks I am interested in him and therefore am an easy target rather than HIM BEING INTERESTED IN ME? I mean, I would want a guy to approach me bc he thinks I'm beautiful, not because my interest strokes his ego. That's just humiliating for a woman. 

Second of all, how do I do that, like technically. I'm not talking about randos on the street; but, apparently, here, acquaintances, guys from the same college etc. when they engage with you at a party or in any other social gathering they expect YOU to indicate an interest in them before making their intentions clear. Then a) when a guy starts talking to me how tf do I differentiate between a guy who is gauging my interest and a guy who is just making conversation in a friendly way? And b) how can I signal to a guy I am available to be pursued without sounding too eager and making a fool out of myself? I've tried giggling at their jokes in a slightly fak-ish way, especially at parties, but my friends say that it's still not direct enough.",Morrolan_,3,1690628243.0,0.63,1641,303,1641

It makes him unhappy and I was begging and begging to the point where i feel like I'm just holding someone who wants to leave...

It was not what i was used to ans it got me worried.

"Bf was unfaithful once, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Looking for advice Not sure if it‚Äôs the right place to post this but here it goes, 
My bf (31m) and I (24f) have been together for 2 years, long distance. I found nudes of a woman in his deleted album when he left his phone unlocked downstairs one night. (Not proud that I snooped) I know he didn‚Äôt take them himself because we had an app that tracks locations at all times and he was never suspicious. He told me that it was a woman he used to sext on WhatsApp a year before we started dating (she lives in another country). He never heard from her until that night when she told him that she visited the States and he responded. Then she said to him, ‚Äú I have a gift for you.‚Äù, the nudes were followed. He said their convo last for a duration of 8 hours (with a total of roughly 15 text messages since he works at night). He admitted sending selfies back to her but realized right after what he did was wrong and shut it down - deleted everything (chat and photos) and went to bed. WhatsApp has a feature that saves photos to album it not turned off manually. 

I‚Äôm contemplating on what to do next, I want to forgive him but tell me if I‚Äôm being naive: 
- it‚Äôs been over 8 months since it‚Äôs happened and his story has never changed. 
- He‚Äôs also got rid of all social media and messaging apps.
- Reassumes me that he‚Äôs 100% faithful to me. 
- What I can‚Äôt quite give through is that he sent selfies back to her, though he immediately realized what he did was wrong. 
I want to move past this because he‚Äôs shown great effort since the very beginning of our relationship, and still does. His work is hectic and he always prioritizes spending time with me. He said that he made a terrible mistake, but he corrected himself right after and shut it down, never let it happen again. He told me that he‚Äôs grateful for this incident because it‚Äôs shown him that he was weak at the moment and lost sight of who he is, and that he needed to be better. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know.. I‚Äôve never been betrayed before. I want to believe that people make mistakes and learn from them, but I hope I‚Äôm not being too naive.

"Shall I get with a man I‚Äôm not attracted to?

What do I do then? Shall I throw physical desire and attraction to the wind in favour of a more average or even unattractive looking man who will likely offer more stability, more obtainable for me and be more grateful to have Me?

"Childhood traumas = difficulty in dating I'm (24F) the eldest sibling and I'm the only one single. My twin brothers are only a year younger than me and are already in years long serious relationships--like wedding bells ringing in the distance kind of relationships. 

I've never been in one so I'm kinda jealous. Every time I dip my toes in the waters, I back out. I always go back to the memories of my father hurting my mother physically and my mother hurting him verbally and psychologically. This happened when I was in highschool. Every night I wake up to them almost killing each other in their fights. I was the only one who witnessed it since I'm a light sleeper. My brothers sleep thru any disaster imaginable. I swear someone was trying rob our house, there were footsteps clanging on the roof, they're dead asleep. We had a major earthquake around 5 something intensity, dead asleep. I think that's why I only had this and they turned out fine.

Every teeny tiny sign of similar characteristic of my parents, it's like my eyes flash forward to how this man can potentially react to my words, my behavior, my humor, my expression, anything to eventually hurting me. Or that time when someone liked me and I tried to open up to them; I got scared that somehow I might end up hurting them by acting like how my parents did to each other. So it's a never ending cycle of me being scared of the possibility that I become vulnerable enough for them to hurt me or me hurting them.

However, now we hang out maybe once a week (which im perfectly fine with) howe, it seems like he has a lot of time for his friends on the weekends. sometimes I think he‚Äôs not as interested anymore but then he tells me things how he‚Äôs going to help me move into my apartment next month and cook me dinners which seems pretty intimate to me. he also continues to keep conversation with me daily and when we hang out in person he‚Äôs very kind and sweet.  I want to have the conversation. However a part of me also knows that it could either go good or bad and if it goes bad I might not see him again out of awkwardness. I feel like if he wanted me to be his girlfriend he would‚Äôve said something by now.

"Go From Talking Every Day To Not At All, Need Advice So I'll preface by saying I've \[30M\] only been seeing ""C"" \[26F\] for a couple of weeks,  but I haven't honestly navigated this type of scenario in god knows how  long so I need a bit of advice (or just re-assurance maybe). C and I went on a date two-ish weeks ago, and honestly I've never had more sparks fly; we ended up talking until the restaurant closed and she was the one to kiss me when we went to say goodbye, pretty good start right? Next day we ended up calling and chatting for a bit on the phone again, getting to know each other more. 

I had bought tickets for Oppenheimer and we were supposed to see them two days after the first date, but it turns out I had bought them for the wrong day, we ended up going out to eat, and afterwards sat in my car cuddling and talking for another three hours. We end up both sharing some traumas (her more so than myself), but overall still a great time. Next three days we repeat the same process, call at night to talk or a date (she came over for the next two and we just chilled), incredibly intimate experience but not much sexual (due to aforementioned traumas, we had a little bit of fun). This girl has literally said ""I wish I could stay here forever"" while laying on my chest, and I took that as a pretty good sign; I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive as a result - obviously it hadn't been very long but considering how things were progressing it didn't feel too out of place. I will say that I told her (and anyone I date) that I'm a bit more traditional and only date one person at a time, I get if they don't want to do that as well obviously though and am cool with that. Anyways after asking, she said she wasn't ready for that and we left it as is and left shortly after.  


Since then it's been close to radio silence, maybe one or two texts back and forth a day - we weren't texting a lot but it was more than that. She has been busy with seeing out of state friends for the past 3-4 days, but it's jarring to me that we went from being that close to near radio silence. Am I reading too much into it or do we take it as a sign that she lost interest due to asking to be exclusive too soon?  


TLDR - Somehow became incredibly intimate with someone early on, asked if they wanted to be exclusive, and now can't tell if they're genuinely busy or lost interest in me",a_bad_live-er,3,1690671543.0,1.0,2397,471,2397
"Weird situation with ex and family (18M)(18F) So my ex and I broke up a year ago (18M) (18F). (Disclaimer those ages aren‚Äôt correct, it‚Äôs just to pass the bot). It was a pretty easy breakup, not much to it, although it was entirely out of the blue. We were friends for about a year prior (high school). She blocked me on everything and apparently hates me now. I‚Äôm not sure why, we haven‚Äôt even talked since before the breakup. But, supposedly, someone told her a bunch of fake rumors about me, and she absolutely ate them up. However, they‚Äôre all extremely far fetched and the complete opposite of my personality and things that I would do. 

But she continuously takes little shots at me. For example at parties she‚Äôs made comments at me when she walks past. One example being when I was helping my friend who wasn‚Äôt doing great to a couch and she said ‚Äúmaybe you should sit down too‚Äù (I was completely fine if you know what I mean). 

At the start of the school year I heard from a mutual friend that she wanted me to ask her to homecoming which I said no to, as I assumed it was a joke and also just didn‚Äôt feel like it. She has also called me once or twice through the year as using the unknown caller thing (I heard her voice in the background).Her friends snap me pictures of her continuously every few weeks. 

I find this all very weird. I don‚Äôt have any problem with her. To be honest, I‚Äôd have said that I have a positive opinion on her until I saw her shit talking me on a friends phone, despite us breaking up a whole year ago, and her being the one to do it. 

Now my question is how to deal with this. The obvious answer is to ignore her, which is I‚Äôve done for the past year. However, our families are good friends and my parents continually tell me I should try to fix things, even just saying hi to her. Her parents also really like me and supposedly want us to be friends as well but that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve heard. And I don‚Äôt think her parents know about whatever this drama is. 

The more important part is that we have mutual friends which makes it awkward, mainly on her part, when we‚Äôre around each other. We‚Äôre likely going to have a lot of classes together next year, how do I deal with this? What‚Äôs the best way to go? 

There‚Äôs a lot of details that I left out, so feel free to ask if something doesn‚Äôt make sense or whatever.

"Would you pay for a set number of matches for a DA? 
The problem with all dating apps are that men heavily outnumbered women. Women has thus become too selective due to a sea of options but lack of quality, and men has become desperate and swipes right too easily.

 A dating app should somehow take into account this inherent gender ratio imbalance to increase match quality, to the benefit of both genders. To that I have some ideas:

- Severely limit the number of matches a person can concurrently have ( 1 or 2) . If they match with someone they are out of the swipe pool. -&gt; should make men much more selective.

- Monetization model should be based on number of matches instead of monthly subscription model. So say you pay 15$ for 5 matches. The match only counts after some minimum number of back and forth conversation. You get refunded if the profile is later reported and flagged as bot.

- The app should be free for women (to attract them using the app, to the benefit of men)

- Due to the change in monetization model the app can make  available all the features normally reserved for premium users of other dating apps (all kinds of filters, see who likes you, statistics, etc,...)

"Shy girl gave me her number, but I'm struggling to get her to come out of her shell I sat next to her in our college classes. We had some pleasant conversations, but she was clearly very quiet, shy, and nervous. I asked her out but she said she was busy.

"Some advice on core values in long term relationships Hi all, I‚Äôve been in a healthy and fulfilling relationship for the last 3.5yrs. My boyfriend (for this post we‚Äôll call him John) and I met right before the pandemic on Tinder of all places.

For this post, I wanted to touch on one aspect of our relationship that I think helped us a lot: complimentary core values. Hopefully by putting my thoughts to text, I can help you as well.

Basically, **don‚Äôt think about politics**‚Äì think about what *leads* to politics. Do you hold equality as key and so push for communism? Do you believe that a relationship with a deity is paramount, and so hold religious teachings above the wants and needs of any given individual?

My boyfriend and I both hold freedom for the individual as a core value. His reasoning led him to libertarianism while it led me to liberalism. These are different politics and we‚Äôve had a lot of debates on the merits of each and our conclusions on different issues. Because we were both starting from a core value of freedom for the individual, though, we are able to have a more stable relationship.

If I was a very devout Muslim who held my relationship with Allah above all (core value) and wanted to impose Sharia Law (politics) while John retained his individualist values and libertarian politics‚Äì this would lead to a lot of arguing. If neither of us changed our core values, it would put massive strain on our relationship.

Core values are where relationships make or break. If your values conflict, you will eventually have problems. Opinions and preferences (I think chocolate is gross, he loves it) really don‚Äôt matter to the stability of the relationship so long as they‚Äôre respected as opinions and preferences.

How do you understand your partner‚Äôs core values? Simple‚Äì ask! When John and I were getting to know each other on a deeper level, we watched those Jubilee Middle Ground videos to start conversations. We‚Äôd take IDR Labs tests for the same reason.

Yes, a lot of these conversations got heated. We‚Äôd yell, ‚ÄúHow can you believe that?! Insane!!‚Äù but always end the conversations with, ‚ÄúLove you, by the way!‚Äù so we knew there were no hard feelings.

The only reason we were able to have these conversations is because we knew ourselves. We knew who we were, who we wanted to be, and WHY. You have to put in the work to understand your value system before you start dating. If you or your partner don‚Äôt, hash it out over a few months, just be respectful about it.",RadioSphinx,3,1690676628.0,0.81,2505,441,2505

It usually ends up ruining the friendship although I am very respectful of boundaries and try to communicate as healthily and respectfully as possible about mine and their feelings and what the relationship is. I eventually end up losing those feelings after we have communicated about the nature of the relationship. And I usually end up getting those feelings for someone else as soon as that happens and the cycle continues. I still remain friends with some women that this has happened with but not as close as I would like to be with them even platonically. I understand this isn't very healthy which is why I am asking for advice.

I just want some tips on how to not get so caught up in the idea of us ending up in a relationship and to be okay with the idea of us just being friends.

Any advice would be appreciated",ELementalSmurf,4,1690449344.0,1.0,1122,203,1122
"Should I confront the guy I‚Äôm dating why he hasn‚Äôt texted me in week? I (24F) started seeing this guy (25M) back in March. There have been a few ups and downs and we live about 4 hours apart. The TLDR is in the last paragraph. The 4th paragraph contains necessary backstory I recommend you read. 

We stopped talking for two weeks late April (I blocked him) because I got mad at him for being angry that his ex/mother of his child hooked up with his friend. I ended up forgiving him.

We saw each other in person in June. He came up the first time to see his family and made time to see me. The second time I visited him and I almost broke it off because he fell asleep on me after we hooked up. I ended up spending the afternoon with his family but we made up.

(Necessary backstory) 
We were supposed see each other 2 weeks ago but a family member he lives with got sick. He hasn‚Äôt came up to see me because he said he doesn‚Äôt have money right now. He recently just switched jobs. 

Ever since he canceled on me I haven‚Äôt heard from him in a week. I called him Sunday night it went to voicemail. I texted Monday morning to see if he was doing well. He struggles with depression on top of having adhd. He recently got on medication for his depression and starting seeing therapy. 

Another important thing to note is earlier this year I told him I was messing around with a friend. Days before I was set to come out, I told him the truth that it was actually my coworker not a friend. I told  him I lied about it because I was embarrassed. I clarified things between us are over and I don‚Äôt want to be with him. He‚Äôs also gotten cheated on the past.  

I know it was wrong to hide that and I apologized. 

Another important thing to note we defined early on we wanted a serious relationship. When I admitted the truth about my coworker we also discussed this again and asked if we‚Äôre heading towards a relationship. 

My question is, should I call/text him to see why he hasn‚Äôt contacted me? I want to text him something like ‚Äúhey I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a week are we still good? I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôre done because I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a week. If so next time do the right thing and at least send a text ending things.‚Äù 

TLDR: the longish distance guy I‚Äôm seeing canceled on me coming out two weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since he canceled on me. I tired reaching out Sunday night and my call went to voicemail and texted the next day day no response. I want to text him to ask why he hasn‚Äôt reached out and if things are done between us.

"I (M21) getting confusing signals from my friend (F21) I have this female friend situation i really need some advice here

For context im in my early twenties so is she. Ive known her for about 2 years now and have been friends since. We met over a mutual friend. And I notice that Im starting to fall in love with her. The problem is‚Ä¶ she really confuses me

When I ask her do do something she says yes when she has time and seems exited to see me shes very touchy and cuddles with me when were on a couch or something. She takes random pictures of me and even had me as her lockscreen on her phone. But shes not a big texter and very rarely asks me out back. 

The way shes physical with me feels like shes trying to make me make a move.  For example we where lying on my bed and shes hugging me and lying on top of me for a little bit but as i do nothing she stops hugging me again, slaps my but jokingly or starts playfights. 

The problem is that she says she doesnt like men and relationships or intimacy that way. She even had a girlfriend before.

Im not making any moves because she told me that but i feel like she also gives different signals. Im also pretty insecure and scared about relationships since ive never been intimate with a girl before. And have been hurt badly before. 

What im i suposed to do im noticing im falling in love and i dont know what to do i cant read the situation properly but i also dont want to loose her as a friend. And i dont want my heart broken again:(

How do i confront her about my feelings or deal with the situation in general?

"My bf (straight 17M) is mad at me (bi 17F) for having a sleepover and sleeping in the same bed as my straight (17F) friend. Recently, I had a road-trip with one of my closest friends (who I have only ever viewed as platonic) and when I asked my bf if he would feel more comfortable with me sleeping on the couch rather than a bed with her, he said it was up to me whatever I do. I have slept on the same bed on similar road-trips in the past with this friend before I met him, so I decided to take the bed with her and told him I was doing so. Everything was fine until the next day she told him that in my sleep I would flail my limbs around unconsciously and at some point my leg ended up on top of her.
He grew extremely angry thinking I did it on purpose with flirty intents and has since been very hypocritical, saying a lot of things that I do with my female friends that he does with male friends are different because of my sexuality. I am extremely sad because of the increasing distance I have to build with all of my friends regardless of gender.

"Desperately needing to get out of a dating/relationship rut. HELP! Hey everyone,

Just fyi, I‚Äôm new to reddit and this is my first post. I am a 26M and have been in a dry spell with women for about 5 years now. I have never been on a date before and have only had 3 sexual encounters which were all not very good. I isolated myself all throughout high school and college (I did have some internet and videogame issues at the time which I have thankfully overcome) and never put myself out there. I did have some friends, but I isolated myself way too much. I also never used social media at all, and I realize how much that has hurt me. 

However, I have definitely turned some things around the past year or so. Im currently working at a hospital and will be applying to grad schools to become a Physician Assistant in April ‚Äò24. That being said, I refuse to waste any more of my life living without dating and sexual relationships. It just feels weird that I have barely had any experience at all. I don‚Äôt even consider myself an ugly person at all, but my game around women sucks and I feel awkward at times. I‚Äôve even had women be interested in me in the past, but was too insecure to take advantage of the opportunity. Time has flown by so fast, and I can‚Äôt afford to waste anymore time living like this. What are some ways I can talk to girls without just sounding so generic, I just don‚Äôt feel like I have a lot of interesting things to say. Also, what are good ways I can initiate conversations with girls. I need to gain more confident, but I don‚Äôt wanna come off as too aggressive.

I want to finally enjoy my life and actually have experiences with other women until it‚Äôs too late. This is a top priority in my life right now and any advice would be appreciated. Please help! Thanks.",Zexy_Magician86,4,1690573523.0,1.0,1794,339,1794
"My gf just overreacted in a way, that left me completely speechless. I will rewrite it exactly as we texted (can¬¥t post pictures, since we're not speaking in English):

Me: ""I've just been thinking, that whenever we have a debate and we agreed before, that neither of us is using a phone during the debate, well what if neither of us is right, but we will agree on something, that may actually be wrong vs. if we googled it, we would find the correct answer and we would both broaden our horizons. What do you think?

Her: ""Finding something online doesn't mean it's always right.""

Me: ""True, but even still it may give you an option, that neither of us possibly even thought of and then we might agree, that the newly discovered point may be correct.""

Her: ""Why do we even need to use a phone to have options? That's what it's about - using our brains and creativity in finding a new solution. You can debate with any idiot if you have a phone in your hand. That doesn't mean that person is smart and has ideas and is nice to talk to. Double-checking something is okay I guess.""

Me: ""Well we might discuss a topic, that neither of us really knows that much about.""

Her: ""Well the way you judge it  is like, if you don't know it, neither of us knows it.""

Me: ""Well it can show itself naturally sometimes, that neither of us really knows that much about the given topic you know.""

Her: ""When you say your points, that's it. Period. When I say mine, you whip out your phone.""

Me: ""...honey, I'm not attacking you.""

Her: ""I know. But it feels like we don't always agree with each other and then you say ok, just say so and I'll stop. Then in a week we have a conversation, which is lead so you can justify that you can double check my info and then keep on doing it. If you don't believe my observations, then don't debate with me. Don't ask me, if you just go look for answers somewhere else afterwards. You wouldn't like it, if someone at your work did that to you. Do it once or twice and you say to yourself, that it's fine. But do it for a whole month and you just get fed up with it. I can't debate in peace with someone, who doesn't treat me as an equal. It is what it is. You see it as a weakness or a mistake. I won't keep trying to convince someone, that doesn't even see it, that I'm not dumb.""

Me: ""...ok.""

Her: ""Now you're mad. For my honest answer.""

Me: ""No, I just didn't expect this reaction.""

"Mourning the end of a FWB My FWB and I have called it quits. I feel really sad about its not because I wanted to date them or liked them romantically but because we actually genuinely became good friends and were constantly talking. We occasionally hang out with the same friend group too. It was going to happen eventually because I will be moving to another city.

I think he was catching feelings and he is also a few years younger than me so I am trying to value his space too. I feel like he is trying to play it off casually which makes me wonder either if he is even sad too (like I thought he would be) and needs space or if he really just doesn‚Äôt care to be my friend/about me like I thought he did.

Anyway, how do you guys get over this feeling? Lol. Again it feels like mourning the loss of a friendship, it‚Äôs not that I fell in love. We were both also very clear from the start even though I do think he caught feelings.

"I got broken up with but believe it was self sabotage from my boyfriend. How can I fix this and support him ? Hello everyone,

  
My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. We have been dating for about a year and a half. He is the absolute light of my life : I feel loved, cared for, trusted and safe with him.  
Everything was going well. We met during our studies, but had to spend one year long distance (due to said studies), but managed to meet often. We were planning to get a cat and move in together sometime soon. I am absolutely sure he is right for me, and I have always believed I was right for him too.

  
Lately, he has been very busy, and I think he is burnt out. He said often this last few weeks that he feels low, depressed. I tried supporting him as much as I could. It was hard to see him hurt, but I knew it would get better. His visa is close to an end and he struggles finding a good job to renew it. He might have to move back to his birth country for a while, and I believe this adds on to the stress he is feeling.

  
He decided to break up with me almost out of nowhere. I felt so shocked I couldn't think straight and I didn't manage to say the things I wanted to. Now, I can't eat, I struggle to fall asleep but refuse to wake up because I dream of him, I spend my day holding his old tshirt in my hand. Common friends have mentionned their surprise in this turn of event, and agree with my perception of things. It could be self-sabotaging.  
He told me he loved me so dearly, and that he was leaving me so that I could be happy. I think he believes his depression brings me down, and that I cannot be happy with him. Yet, he made me the happiest and healthiest I have ever been.  
He says he struggles with guilt for ""not being good enough"". I think being rejected from jobs have reinforced his self esteem issues. he also says he needs alone time, which I understand and respect. He usually goes to therapy, but hasn't had time lately.

  
We will be calling again tomorrow, to talk about all this. I am planning on writing a text to help me say all I want to say : having written notes will help me stay calm and control my emotions better.  
About why I am posting this : I need help, I am lost. I never thought this would happen and im very unprepared to deal with it.  
Do you have ideas how to support someone with low self esteem ? How to show someone they are enough ? Ideas to improve communication in a relationship ?

  
Thank you so much for helping me, I wish you all the best.

  
TLDR : my boyfriend have self esteem issues, and feels he is not good enough for me. He is now burn out and broke up with me, probably as self sabotage. Now I need help : tomorrow we are calling, and I want to show him I am there for him and to support him, that he is enough and I love him. How can I support him better ? How can I help with his self esteem ? How can I show him he is enough ? Communication tips ? Thank you so much for your help.",ThrowRA2021222324,4,1690644866.0,0.75,2980,598,2980
"Navigating Dating in 2023 A dating experience I had about two months ago has been sticking with me and is negatively affecting my view of dating today. I think what bothers me about it is what I‚Äôm about to share is very a very standard experience for daters in 2023.    

I saw a really cute girl at a restaurant with her friends so I went up with a friend and introduced ourselves. We ended up hitting it off really well and spent the rest of the night drinking, talking, dancing, and kissing. Two nights later I took her out to a nice restaurant for dinner, then to another bar for a drink after. We went back to her place and made out. She wanted to have sex but I decided to hold off as I thought there may be potential for something more than a hook-up because the chemistry was very good and we shared a number of the same hobbies and values (spoiler: I was wrong).    

She came over on a Tuesday evening, I cooked her dinner, we had sex, she spent the night, and we had sex in the morning. That upcoming Friday I was going out of town and she said she had a girls trip planned as well. She texted me heavily the rest of the week and we made plans for the following Wednesday when we were both back in town.    

Over the weekend she posted a few photos, none of which included any other people which I knew was a red flag. If she was on a ‚Äúgirls trip‚Äù she would‚Äôve posted pics with friends, or been tagged in pics. I texted her on Monday and she told me she was getting serious with someone else and it wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate for us to see each other any more and she apologized three times.    

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs not a big deal. We essentially had 3 dates, weren‚Äôt exclusive, and I didn‚Äôt have strong feelings for her yet. But she clearly lied about the purpose of her trip - she went on a weekend trip with another guy. I guess her plan was to have sex with me, go on a vacation with another guy, and, if it didn‚Äôt become more serious, come home and presumably continue having sex with me given we had another date planned.    

Most people on here will say ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt exclusive, she can hookup with whoever she wants.‚Äù Sure, I suppose she can, but something tells me her current boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt be thrilled to find out she was in someone else‚Äôs bed three days before their planned vacation. If that trip didn‚Äôt go well I presume she would‚Äôve come home and continued having sex with me and probably not have told me what she really did that weekend.    

From my perspective, I can‚Äôt take someone seriously as a potential partner if they‚Äôre jumping back and forth from my bed to another guy‚Äôs bed in the initial stages of dating. That is a lousy foundation to build a relationship on in my book. Some posters here tell their dates they only sleep with people when they are exclusive, and if that‚Äôs a dealbreaker for the date then so be it. My issue with that is, in 2023 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go very well for me to essentially tell women right off the bat they can‚Äôt sleep with other people if they want to date me. No one wants to feel like someone they are just getting to know is trying to control their behavior.    

My frustration is that she didn‚Äôt break any ‚Äúrules‚Äù of modern dating other than lying about the weekend trip. From this experience, and others, I can‚Äôt help but feel that in the courting phase I have to invest my time, money, and energy into a woman who is going to continue sleeping around regardless of how well things are going. This leaves me to feel like I have two options. 1) Stop dating. 2) Accept that any future girlfriend will have slept with other men during the courting phase.

"My dating history I was sitting at my computer, scrolling through the pages of a dating website, trying to find my better half. Honestly, I was starting to lose hope that I could find something real here. But suddenly, my eyes landed on a photo, captivating and mysterious with its gaze.  
I decided not to hesitate and sent her a message, making sure to attach my own photo. After a while, I received a reply: ""Hello! What are your interests in life?"" There was something in her tone that made my heart beat faster.  
Our conversation became unusually easy and enjoyable. She turned out to be an intelligent and educated woman, with a sense of humor and a hidden tenderness. We spent hours exchanging stories from our lives, deeper thoughts, and dreams.  
With each passing day, we grew closer and closer. It didn't even take a week before she suggested meeting up. I agreed, but only in a public place. Honestly, I had some doubts and fears, including about my own appearance.  
So the day came when we finally saw each other. We met at a local caf√© to have a private conversation. And in that moment when I saw her, all my concerns vanished. She was even more beautiful in person than in the photo.  
We spent several hours together, and time flew by unnoticed. We laughed, got to know each other better, exchanged tender glances and passionate handshakes. It felt like there was no one else around us, just the two of us, an inseparable couple.  
The story of my online dating experience turned into a true love story. Gradually, our dates became more frequent, and we both realized that our happiness knew no limits.

We agreed to go to a mini golf/ arcades with a bar and nice restaurant, we met her 2 friends there (Lydia &amp; Erin). The night was going great, drinks and conversation was flowing and the food was delicious. So, it comes time to pay. We had racked up a pretty hefty bill and as the waiter asked how we wanted to pay I said I will pay for myself and Tanya. Oh boy did this outrage her 2 friends, as soon as I said this they hurled abuse and insults at me. Calling me broke and a misogynist for not paying the whole thing, I replied back I‚Äôm not paying for you two as you two are not my date. Tanya tried to defend me but after like 5 minutes she just told me to pay for the whole thing. In the end I only paid for myself and left.",Obvious_Ant5210,4,1690922450.0,1.0,1091,222,1091
"My BF passes gas a lot and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up. Hey everybody! This is my first post here. I have a question and need to vent a little I think. I (black 30f) have been dating a wonderful guy (white33m) for about 2 months now. It‚Äôs my first ever relationship. He‚Äôs a wonderful guy! Clever, kind, funny and so gentle. I enjoy being with him so much and love almost everything he does with me. But there is one problem that‚Äôs been bothering me. He often passes gas when we are together. It‚Äôs the silent but deadly type. It‚Äôs not on every date, about 60%, but it‚Äôs awful. The worst part is that he gives no reaction. No apology or ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù or rolling down the windows. The first time we were at a show and cuddled up together and I kept getting this awful smell and I didn‚Äôt want to believe it was him because would you really just let it lose for an hour while snuggled up with your girlfriend? Recently I met some of his friends for the first time and he kept on doing it while we were all driving to a show. Some of them were so bad and no one said anything and I‚Äôm just screaming inside and trying to smell my hairspray to get some relief. 

I‚Äôm not saying that I want him to stop passing gas. It‚Äôs a normal bodily function and my own are deadly as well. But the complete lack of acknowledgment is really bothering me. What is up with this? I worry that it‚Äôs a medical condition so I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. But I personally find it massively disrespectful. There are times you can hold gas in, but if you can‚Äôt then aren‚Äôt you supposed to say ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù at the very least? I haven‚Äôt done it around him yet but I excuse myself every time I burp in his presence, and they‚Äôre little baby burps too. Like roll down the windows if we‚Äôre in the car, or go off a few steps while we are standing somewhere (we were in line to pay for something at the mall and I just had to pretend to browse to get away from the smell multiple times). If we‚Äôre cuddled up then say something and push me away, don‚Äôt hold me closer as you poison my air. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my mother about it and our family therapist, but they both have the same racial and cultural background as me and are from an older generation. In my family we can‚Äôt even say the normal f word for passing gas, it‚Äôs considered vulgar and impolite. They find it completely disrespectful but I can‚Äôt tell if what we think is in line with current societal norms. I might be old fashioned or just overly sensitive. This is all so new to me and I‚Äôm an anxious autistic so I have no idea how to address this. My anxiety is going to absurd lengths like wondering if he has no sense of smell (I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever commented on my perfume and I try to wear different ones. I don‚Äôt care but I noticed) or has an embarrassing medical condition that his friends know about so they avoid bringing it up. Does anyone have any advice? 

Also, we are about to go away for the weekend for the first time and what if he gasses up the hotel room???",OurLadyOfSparkles,4,1690470752.0,0.71,2993,584,2993
"do i need to get over myself? so i(22AFAB) started talking this girl(22F) almost a month ago, she briefly mentioned on our first date she was going through a divorce but didn't elaborate further. after a few more dates and getting intimate with each other i felt like she wasnt telling me something and when i asked about her living situation, she said that she still lives with her ex wife. i've been learning to try and trust her. 
last night i asked how she felt things were going between us and she mentioned she doesnt want to get into a relationship until the divorce is finalized which is beginning of september. she also mentioned that i'm not allowed to go inside their apartment out of respect for her ex wife.
i guess im just having mixed feelings bc im worried she may be hiding me from her but she insists she isnt. what's also been bothering me is that they separated in April.. only almost 4 months ago and they were together for 4 years. she said she's worked through it and now she wants a partner. should i just get over my own insecurities and trust her? or should i cut it off while its still relatively fresh?

"Want to ask out a ""friend"" but don't know if I should? So I've (40m) been ""activity buddies"" with this woman (37f) for 5 months now. Activities being kayaking, hiking, and biking. We are both outdoor minded. 
We met on OkCupid, I was/am looking for a girlfriend, she was (is?) Looking for friendship only. 

When I asked why, since she was marked as single her response was along the lines of (been awhile so paraphrasing) ""I got out of a long relationship (years), and before that another long relationship. I'm in my nursing program and I can't give a partner the time they need so I think it's a good time to just focus on myself. So I set a hard boundary of no boyfriends until I graduate."" 

I'm kinda falling hard for her though. She's nice (she moves turtles off the road, and I saw her apologize to a tree once for bumping into it), she's fit, pretty, and it took a lot of strength to not make a move on her when we went kayaking last and she was only in a bikini. 

I keep wondering if I should ask her out on a real date, or if I really like this girl I need to just play the long game and hope I'm not permanently friend-zoned? I am totally lost on what to do, because last time we were examining a mushroom on the trail I seriously just wanted to kiss her.",rUaPirate_,4,1690402739.0,1.0,1268,245,1268
"Intense anxiety and guilt surrounding doing anything sexual is stopping me from losing my virginity 
I‚Äôm a 25 year old guy who‚Äôs a virgin for reference. I was always an ugly duckling, terrified to flirt because I didn‚Äôt want to be a creep, etc., but I‚Äôm a late bloomer and the last few years I‚Äôve really grown into myself, become a bit more confident and stuff too. I get a good amount of matches on tinder, and I‚Äôve had quite a few women flirt with me more and more recently. Women have approached me in clubs and bars a couple of times, I‚Äôve had women from tinder say they‚Äôre down to hook up and date, my friend told one girl while we were drunk that I was a virgin and she gave me her number and told me to meet her later and she‚Äôd happily ‚Äòteach me a few things‚Äô, etc.

But I can‚Äôt stop getting in my own way. I have this really intense, almost intrusive irrational anxiety about being a creep, violating someone‚Äôs consent, etc., and I don‚Äôt know where it stems from. I think I have such a deep belief that I‚Äôm not sexually attractive that I have this anxious belief that any time someone‚Äôs interested in me, that it can‚Äôt be real, and that I‚Äôd be doing something wrong by disrespecting that. It‚Äôs like insanely low self worth. It used to be easy to rationalise this; I didn‚Äôt get much romantic attention, so it didn‚Äôt matter what I felt. Now I do, and I‚Äôll be happily talking to someone, or getting to know them, and it turns sexual and suddenly I need to get out of it.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs asexuality, I want to have sex. I‚Äôm just scared. And any time something does happen I feel intense guilt. I‚Äôve made out with a few girls now, and every time I have intense guilt after. I replay it in my head the next day, wondering if it was all okay, if I went too far, if maybe they didn‚Äôt actually want to, even though like every time they initiated it or kissed me because I was too scared to kiss them. 

Last week I had a really explicit example; I was in a club and this girl literally just told me I‚Äôm cute, we talked for a few minutes, she told me she wanted to kiss me and we ended up making out for quite a while. She was clearly really into it; the kissing got really intense, we were both grabbing each other, she was basically grinding herself against me while we made out and like lifting her leg up over me to get as close as possible lmfao. We pulled away a couple of times and just kept going back in. After that she said ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love if we could fuck right now‚Äô, but then my friends told me they were leaving. They said they get it if I decided to stay, but I left with them. The next day I was terrified because what if she wanted me to stop? What if she was too drunk, or I‚Äôd taken advantage or something (I was really drunk too). Like I don‚Äôt think any of that‚Äôs the case rationally; it was a drunken makeout where we both just got a little carried away. It happens. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like dirty and like I done something wrong.

I don‚Äôt know where it comes from. It‚Äôs like intense guilt surrounding sex, like it‚Äôs something i shouldn‚Äôt be doing, or like women can‚Äôt like me enough to want that from me, so my brain decides I must be a creep for even wanting to or enjoying it. There‚Äôs been other times too where someone‚Äôs made a move on me and I just feel so creepy for reciprocating, and usually they‚Äôre incredibly blatant about wanting something to happen.

"[30M] When life is a hall of mirrors... The last few years have been difficult for me as my disease has progressed to the beginning of the end stage. It's come with a long list of realizations, compromises, and acceptances. I've always had to overcome adversity my whole life, but I always could adapt, rebound, and succeed. This time the damage and loss is permanent, there's no going back, and going forward means losing the rest of what's left of myself and who I am piece by piece, day by day, and I've already lost too much. It's warped and destroyed my life and completely turned my world inside-out. What's more, it has overtly changed the way people react to and treat me. Especially when it comes to making friends, and double especially dating. And by that I mean they just avoid me, altogether. It's made this period of my life extremely difficult and solitary.

I've spent the last several years completely alone. No friends, no romance, minimal interaction with the outside world. Not by choice, and not for lack of trying. And the truth is it's killing me faster, especially when people lead me on instead of just having the guts to say ""no"". Which would hurt a hell of a lot less than blown expectations. But when you're looking down the barrel of life, with Death patiently waiting for you in the cylinder, it really makes you realize what's important. I have so much left I need to do, and I don't want to finish this life alone.

I don't want sympathy. I just want someone to treat me like a normal person again. I want the same chances you'd give anyone else. I want to be looked at like a human being when I'm in public instead of with sympathy or repulsion. I'm a person, too, regardless of any medical issues I may have. I know I deserve the same shots at friendship and/or love as everyone else and, though I don't say it, it literally sickens me that I have to practically beg people just to interact with me for 30 damn seconds. I can't imagine what it'd take me to get a phone number.

Blemishes aside, I am an amazing and loving person who has lived a beautiful and full yet tragic almost 31 years. There is so much more to me than the conclusions people draw with one glance. It breaks my heart that people can't see past the tragedy and take a chance on me for everything else I am inside rather than everything I am at face value.

Hopefully there's still someone out there that can see past the rust and grime, with the patience to get to know me for the person I am. If that's you then send me a message. I would genuinely love to talk to you, especially if you're in the PHX area.

"The guy I‚Äôm seeing is going on a reality tv dating show I have been seeing someone for a short amount of time. We both agreed that we wanted to take things slow, but I‚Äôve been sure to clearly communicate that I am dating with intention and that I am physically and mentally prepared for a serious relationship. 

We text every day and our dates have been
so fun and we have both expressed how deeply we‚Äôve connected. 

He‚Äôs tall, dark, handsome, extremely smart and successful in so many ways (currently obtaining huge national awards, magazine covers, etc). He‚Äôs an incredible person I have the utmost respect for him.

I found out he is soon to participate in a reality tv show in which a woman will pick a suitor. 

I don‚Äôt like to make assumptions, but I wish he had been more forthcoming on why he wanted to go slow, as the show must be an enormous, primary influence on that. He must be ready to be in a relationship if he is joining a show like this and it doesn‚Äôt match what he told me. 

As disappointed as I am, it is clear I should not
pursue this anymore and I will no longer try to romantically connect with him, but I‚Äôd like to keep him in my life as a friend. 

I am conflicted on whether to express my
feelings about the show or not. Do I tell him now that I just want to be friends? Do I continue to date him and wait until it‚Äôs closer to the show beginning? I don‚Äôt want to do anything that would jeopardize the chance of a friendship.

"Situationship or Healthy Development ? There's this weird space I haven't seen many talk about. 

When youve been love bombed by every man in your life because you've picked unhealthy partners- healthy, slow relationship development feels unsure and makes me anxious.

I've been seeing a man for about 2 months. We typically meet up once a week. We are having incredible sex at this point and exclusive without a title.

We both discussed upfront that we are slow to attach and had limited free time but he said he would put in the effort to see where this goes and I agreed to the same. 

The problem is that when we are together- typically on his days off we have an incredible time. It really feels great. I've noticed things slowly developing into something more. But, the in between we barely talk. If I text him he does NOW respond quickly (he didn't a few weeks ago) and  our conversations have sustenance. He works nights and so usually when he's awake, I'm asleep and that also complicates things. He said I can text him whenever I want but that he doesn't like the dynamics of texting and would rather get to know someone in person. He is also not active on social media. 

How do you know what is actually a situationship vs a healthy developing relationship? I understand that we complicated things with sex. I promised myself after my divorce if I felt sexually attracted to someone I would act on it. 

Unfortunately now I'm here, wondering what the heck we are. 

Any advice? Is this where I make a decision or discuss it? We HAVE discussed these things in a casual way.

I‚Äôve known of her ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù (she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs toxic in her past relationship).

Recently she‚Äôs been bothered by the amount of female friends I have. I have respected the boundary she placed on not liking or heart reacting to different girl‚Äôs pictures on social media.

"Should I give up on this guy? Will he never want me? Am I friendzoned? There's this guy who I've been somewhat hanging out with. Not really. We met 2 months ago and have been hanging out in person for only 2 times a month so far. We have not had sex. We only cuddled and made out once, then we slept together on the same bed without having sex. When we go out, he pays for everything. Nothing too fancy, just basic ""date"" stuff like movies, casual restaurants, the arcade, other fun activities. Unfortunately I don't think he considers them dates. At first, before we met, I told him if we could date and he said he would have to see where it goes, typical sign of disinterest. I gave it a shot knowing that it's not going to end well, now I'm so confused.

  
Why does he keep talking to me and hanging out with me if he isn't attracted to me? I've explicitly told him that I find him sexy, hot, that I masturbate to him, he makes me wet, now I've been VERY straightforward about my sexual and romantic interest in him. I've told him, straight up, that I want to have sex with him and give him a blowjob (through texts). Very explicit. Yet he doesn't respond to this. He'll change the subject and start talking about something else.

  
\*I\* had to initiate the makeout + cuddle session. In fact, I'm the one who initiated EVERY touch. When we held hands while walking in the park the first time we met, it's because I asked him to. When we hugged after the movies, I asked him. EVERY hug has been initiated and asked by me. I had to invite him over to my place and get turned down MULTIPLE TIMES until he finally agreed like a month later. I even wanted him to come over after our first ""date"" (not... first time we met rather), but he said no. To this day I continue to invite him over while he ignores me and changes the subject. Getting him to come over to my place is like pulling impacted wisdom teeth.

  
He also keeps postponing. EVERY hangout has been postponed so far except July 4th, I guess because it was a holiday.

  
WHY WOULD HE MAKEOUT AND CUDDLE WITH ME, BUT NOT HAVE SEX WITH ME? WHY DOES HE NOT EVEN WANT A BLOWJOB FROM ME? I'm very unattractive, I know that, but why would he continue to talk to someone he isn't attracted to if I've made my interest in him clear? Does he like being molested by some abomination then? He said he's planning to hang out with me again.

  
I asked him why does he even keep me around. He said ""it's nice to have someone to do things with"". So is that all then? Just someone to hang out with when he has nothing and no one else? This is the friendzone, right? Or worse?

"I removed this girl from Instagram because she never replies back to my messages, now she's going out of her way to follow me back again. Why? Hi, everyone!  
I'm new to this community.   
  
I've recently made a new Instagram account because I deleted my old one back in 2018.  
So, I decided that I will keep my account just for family and close friends.  
As I was searching for people. I found this girl that I used to know in college.  
I actually had a little crush on her. She's single and everything. She posts a lot of selfies and stories of herself, showing off her beautiful body and going on hikes with her dogs.  
  
I've sent her a follow request on Instagram because her account is private, and so was mine.  
She accepted my request, and she followed me back.  
So, I've sent her a private message saying, ""Hi, Lily!"" with smiley emoji.  
She read my message and never replied back. I wasn't trippin about it or anything because she probably will get back to me soon, no big deal.  
  
But a week past, and I noticed she never replied back at all. But I've noticed she watched all of my stories and such. So, I started getting all of these weird thoughts in my head. I was thinking, maybe sending her a message saying ""Hi, Lily"" with a smiley emoji came off too strong, or I came off too ""thirsty"" or I sounded like a ""creep"".  
  
I just took the hint that she doesn't want to talk to me. So, I unfollowed her, and I clicked the ""remove friend"" so she doesn't follow me back. I know it sounds petty. But I just took it as she wanted nothing to do with me. And nowadays, women will easily label the guy as a creep for trying to slide into her DMs. Men told me, if a woman doesn't reply to you at all, she doesn't like you, and that you should just take the hint and move on. Because women will always make time to get back to a guy that she likes.  
A few days has passed. And I woke up in the morning to a notification. It was Lily. She's requesting to be my friend on Instagram again. I'm very confused now. Why would she go out of her way to send me a follow request if she doesn't want to talk to me at all? I don't keep people as friends on Instagram if they won't want to reply back. It's pointless.",Creative_Ad_5483,5,1690834349.0,1.0,2235,428,2235
"Accidentally going on a date with my parents friend‚Äôs daughter, thoughts? I (26M) matched with a girl a few days ago. We have lots of similar interests (music, lifestyle, etc.) We‚Äôre meeting for dinner this Wednesday &amp; things are going great.

I ended up finding her FB and saw she was friends with my stepmom. I asked my dad about it and apparently my stepmom &amp; her mom have been best, best friends since college. Sorority sisters, at each others weddings, the whole shebang. Apparently this girl and I have been at some of the same get-togethers, but just never spoke.

Do you guys think this has potential to be awkward?

"Online Dating as a Hyperfixation I've had many, many issues with not sounding desparate while dating online. Or at least, that's how people characterize it. And I've never understood that sentiment. Yes, I want my person. I want to stop looking. I don't *want* to project confidence at someone, I want to feel *safe* with them (I've posted about this before). I want someone to inhabit a home with me, by choice, for the rest of my life. This is my ideal state. I thought that's what most people wanted. Why be coy?

I've always characterized this need as an imperative. But this is a terrible way of explaining things, so I've been thinking of other ways to express how I feel. And last night I found the word for it: hyperfixation.

To anyone unfamiliar with the term, do you know what a mosquito bite feels like? It itches incessantly. You *need* to scratch it. And it's a little fun to do, at first, because you get that endorphin rush of quelling the itch. But then it gets bothersome. The bite gets bigger, and sore, and they often come in waves. And even when it's over, just when you're ready to do something else? You go outside, or a mosquito gets in your house, and it bites you again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have several hyperfixations, almost all of which are stupid. Some are active, while others are passive. I actively hyperfixate on things like, for example, Sonic the Hedgehog (and now you understand why I'm still a virgin). The Sonic franchise is *big*. Lots of games, cartoons, comics, etc., many of which are not in continuity with one another. And I get it in my head to gather art, or design pixel art, to visually express a headcanon. And in theory this is fine. Except that the headcanon never really works. Too many pieces don't fit together. Redundancies exist between continuities. Some characters would, hypothetically, be off-limits in a story due to copyright reasons, and for reasons I could never explain to a rational human being it impacts which characters I use. So I spend hours to days on the Sonic Wiki gathering more and more data, all of which amounts to nothing when I get swept up in my next hyperfixation. It stimulates my mind, but it also burns me out.

A passive hyperfixation often gets paired with an active hyperfixation. Like, for example, rewatching old episodes of Atop the Fourth Wall. These days I hardly pay attention to the episodes, instead letting them play as background radiation. It feels like something between white noise and having company in the room with me.

Here's where this loops back around to online dating: I love stimulating conversation. It's my favorite part of any relationship. And I think that talking, as well as *planning* a relationship, is a form of hyperfixation for me. Because my instinct is to be the architect in any courtship. I feel like I need to be, since otherwise nothing will happen. And I get attached too quickly, without understanding what I want versus what the other person wants. Because I can't understand. I could *never* understand what anyone wants. All I do is fixate on a person, create a narrative in my head, and twist myself to fit that narrative. Or I burn out, and the whole thing falls apart. Actually it falls apart either way, since the approach I take online doesn't translate well *at all* to the real world. Turns out I like to talk, and most women I talk to want to be touched and told how pretty they are all the time. Which is fine, but isn't how I operate. Because that's not how my fixation works.

I think my end-goal is also a hyperfixation. I want someone to live with me. My perfect evening is for us to sit in the living room, maybe quietly, maybe while watching TV or reading, each doing our own thing. And that sounds cold, but to me it isn't. Because we resonate with one another. We are each other's white noise. Yeah, we'd still say pretty words, kiss, have sex, whatever, but those are bonuses. The goal is to just *be* together.

So when I hear people say I come off desperate, it's because I try to solve romantic needs the same way I solve my other needs. I get in over my head, overwork myself, obsess over minor details, and it *never turns off*. Unless I burn out, or the other person gets fed up. And I keep searching for the person who I can weave into my tapestry, because it's the only way I know how to function. I can't decouple this hyperfixation from the rest.

If at least one person reads this and understands, I'll feel as if I've achieved something. ",Wooden-Trip-8053,5,1690732177.0,0.86,4507,810,4507

"Agreeing on 2nd date, not responding afterwards I (M) had a Bumble date yesterday, which I enjoyed a lot. She seemed to enjoy it too and we laughed a lot together as well. We ended the date at the train station, and when we came there saw she had to run to catch the train. No real proper goodbye this, so I just quickly told her I enjoyed it and would like to meet again. She said she thought so too and it came over to me as genuine as well. 

I didnt have her number yet, so messaged her on Bumble repeating I enjoyed it and would like to meet again. 

'Yes would be great'
 Was her exact respond yesterday evening.

I messaged back asking if we had to plan it ahead already, or just wait a bit and see whenever both of us have time in the coming weeks. 

I know one day is not a lot and I'm probably overreacting, but no response yet. 

I've had similar experiences before, where a girl agrees to meet again and then suddenly stops responding, and it honestly makes me crazy and also breaks my self-confidence, hence why I'm tripping now so fast already lol. 
Whenever someone honestly says they do not want to meet again, I don't mind so much, but this truly kind of hurts me....
And I can not really imagine someone being really intent on meeting a 2nd time, implying they see something worth in me, and then not reading the app for 24h...

Anyway, back to the current situation. Should I

A) Just be patient and see when she responds
B) Message with something more concrete, like 'I would be free....
C) Message about something completely unrelated...l",DistributionNo997,5,1690840692.0,0.86,1559,291,1559
"late bloomer dating TLDR: late bloomer \[30m\] told a date I wasn't feeling our connection on 4th date. I feel i spoke to soon and wasted an opportunity for intimacy and connection, which has been extremely rare in my life.

Just venting I guess but I'm \[30m\] a late bloomer and only started dating late in my 20's. I had my first proper dating and romantic experience (4 months dating together) earlier this year but ended things because I couldn't see it going long term.

I had my second romantic experience recently (met on bumble). We hooked up on the second date and it was extremely passionate, like playing out all my fantasy's. On the 4th date we spent a full day out together. I planned a really nice date and it went really well but in the back of my mind there was a small bit of doubt. We get back to my house and end up having really deep conversations about dating, love etc, and I blurted out that i wasn't really feeling our connection as much on this date. She was extremely shocked, and we talked it out a while and she revealed that she had strong feelings for me and I was the first guy to make her forget about her ex. But ultimately there was no going back from my words, and eventually she gave me a hug, thanked me for being honest and left. We had planned to have a take away and romantic evening that night.

A week later and i'm (selfishly i know) massively regretting my decision - i keep playing it over and over again in my head. I feel like I should have held back my feelings and take more time to figure out. All my life i've craved companionship, intimacy and connection, and I threw it all away with an off the cuff remark. Don't get me wrong I don't think we were soul mates, but I really shouldn't be turning away opportunities for connection like this. 

It feels like a really odd place to be 30 and only just experiencing relationships. I want to honest with my dates but I also need to experience connections to figure out what I want in long term relationship. ",throwaway_seven_1,5,1690789462.0,1.0,2006,377,2006

"No amount of self-work and healing will grant you the love of your life This might be a hot take and not everyone will agree with me, but not amount of self-work, healing and being ""ok"" on your own will bring you the right person for you. 

I'm so sick and tired of hearing all these sob stories like ""I was in an abusive relationship, hopeless thinking I'd never meet someone"" and then after 3 months they meet the love of their lives because ""they worked on themselves and weren't looking"". 

I think also blaming the woman takes away the responsibility of a man - if he's a bad guy: it's your fault because you don't love yourself. 

Not because he's an idiot. Not because he's abusive and needs therapy. Not because he's an overall jerk. It's YOUR fault, because YOU allowed it. 

Now, let's say you find a good guy. You hear how lucky you are and how much you deserve it after all you've been through. It's almost like: good thing you went through all that trauma and abuse so it would lead you to a decent man. 

Instead of: holding men accountable for their actions. 

They'll say when you least expect it, someone shows up. But if you're not expecting it, then how did you allow this person to enter your life in the first person? Surely, a little bit of you was expecting it. I think that's another way of shaming single people who want a relationship, like, ""look at me, if you stopped acting so desperate you'd find your person like I found mine, because I wasn't looking because I'm super indenpendent"". And then you actually look at their relationship and the woman is super submissive or the guy is a door-mat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to stop looking. I've deleted dating apps and I'm currently not talking to anyone. I'm focusing on my goals, I'm spending time with loved ones and I'm taking up hobbies. 

Do you know what's been happening during this time in the romance department? Absolutely-fucking-nothing. You know what that brought me in this time? Two men in already relationships - one of them cheated and I found out later and the other one told me he was in an open relationship AFTER he pursued and kissed me. So yeah, wow. Even when I'm not looking, the trash finds me. 

Now, I'm not the most attractive woman in the world but I'm not bad looking either. I can say with confidence I'm better looking than a lot of other women. I know looks aren't everything, but let's start with that. Apart from that I know I had a lot of qualities. 

Yes I sound bitter, jaded and burnt out. And that's because I am. You can only take so much before you realize all you've been told your entire life is a lie. That going to college won't guarantee a job with good pay, that working on yourself won't guarantee meeting a partner. 

It's purely luck at the of the day. ",Independent_Mix6871,5,1690774039.0,0.86,2784,509,2784

"What should I do about dating when I have very low self-esteem/confidence? I (30M) have been single and a virgin forever, and I find it very emotionally and mentally demoralizing. As the title says, my confidence and self-esteem are very low, and my social anxiety, shyness, and pessimism are very high. I've tried dating apps for a long time, but I haven't been successful. I have a good job, a car, and some very cool hobbies. The reason I'm very shy is because of my constant fear of being rejected, as well as the false perception that I've had ever since 8th grade that women hate me for no reason.

"(NSFW) My ex girlfriend harrases me, stalks me and has inappropiate stuff about me and I don't know what to do So, I'm a teen boy (not comfortable saying my age) and I just got out of a really toxic, almost dangerous online relationship. My girlfriend was really sweet at first, she always complimented me, made gifts for me and comforted me, and we could talk for HOURS, I loved her, however some things about her started to make me feel... Weird. 
(Before I continue the story, I'll add some context: My ex is poly and I'll refer to her as E, she was dating my (now) friend at the same time she was dating me, and I'll refer to him as M. E broke up with another lover of hers a week after starting to date me, then they got back and broke up again- and I'll refer to her as S, now, let's continue.)

-She was jealous on an abnormal amount to the point I got isolated because she would scare my friends away.

-She had favoritism, she prefered me over M and S and that was pretty obvious, when she talked to me about S she was like ""Uhh I guess we're dating but I'm not really close with her yk :/"" and she barely mentioned M, however she announced the entire world we were dating and that she loved me, I also feel like she was using me for clout because I have a fair amount of followers online because I upload animations but who knows.

-She never EVER informed any of us when she started dating other ppl at the same time she was dating us or asked for consent, I contacted S and M when I knew they were dating E and talked about it and they both said they had no idea about each other, and I had no idea about them neither, I just knew by accident.

-I was scared to make her mad because she would make a big scandal threatening to delete her social media, insulting her partners and victimizing herself on her accs.

-She lied about being kidnapped (she half admitted it) and made an account pretending to be her kidnapper threatening to hurt her (E) and harrasing us (M and me, especially me? And S didn't know because they already broke up for the first time at that point) and she made a huge drama when we called her out, even blaming M? Then we both broke up with her and she started to date S again THAT SAME DAY and acted lovey-dovey with her.

She did more, way more, really, mostly targeted at me (like disrespecting my grieving, making fun of me, asking me to do sexual stuff I wasn't comfortable with, and whenever I said no she would insist until I accepted, so I pray every day she doesn't show that stuff to anyone). As I said, M broke up with her after the kidnapping incident but stayed as friends, and I decided to give her another chance so we were together again, however I just couldn't handle it anymore and broke up with her because M told (and showed) me she tried to date him again without asking me for my consent, and she also made him uncomfortable with that, and right after that I see a message of her that was like ""Hey, could you ask M to stop being so nice with you? I'm kinda jealous lol"". So I let my anger take the best out of me and I insulted her and broke up with her, and she was almost begging for me to not break up with her, but I told her to screw off. M texted me kinda disappointed of me ig? And showed me E sent him our conversation, I told him I regret being so aggresive. It should have ended up here, right? NO

She made like 5 Pinterest boards with texts either insulting me and expressing on detail how she wants to hurt me or saying how she loves, misses me AND STALKS ME? Made a video victimizing herself and texted me almost everyday asking for forgiveness, I didn't block her because I didn't thought she was going to do this, and if I blocked her I wasn't going to be able to see her account and I wanted to take screenshots of those boards to have proof of her harrasement, so I just ignored her, and her texts started to get more and more aggresive passing the days. M was really concerned because he saw those boards too, but he started to date her again days after that incident... And I feel so betrayed because he knows everything I went through, before they started dating I told him I wouldn't recommend being friends with her, he didn't really care, and just some days ago he vents to me about how he doesn't feel really loved by her and when he tried to talk about it she would ignore him... And I was SO mad, not only at E for making him feel that way but also at M for not listening my advice, I didn't tell him that (and I don't think I will) because I knew it was disrespectful so I just comforted him, but I'm still really annoyed and I feel bad for being annoyed because I know it's not really his fault.

Anyways, some days ago M disappeared suddendly from the internet and didn't even leave my messages on read so I was worried because I know he lives in **really** bad conditions irl so I feared the worse. I decided to text E about it out of desesperation, she told me she didn't know anything and changed the topic asking if I was dating someone, I was confused so I asked ""Why are you asking that?"" And she went like ""What!? I can't know!? I'm just curious :/ Yes or no!?"" AND I WAS LIKE HUH????? Luckily M messaged me saying he was grounded but he's okay so it was a relief, I tried to tell him about my conversation with E and he kind of ignored it? So I don't think I'll tell him...
Just some days ago I was talking with S and we were sharing our experiences with E and she told me I should expose her because I'm the one who got treated the worse by her and so there are no more victims anymore but I don't know... I'm scared, I don't want her to expose that inappropiate stuff about me, and I'm scared people will call me dramatic, but more than that, I'm scared to loose M if I do this, I need an adult that is willing to help me, please. :(

Edit: I don't know if this post belongs in this sub but I didn't know where to post it and I just need help because she's still harrasing and stalking me. She still posts stuff targeted at me, just less intense messages than before luckily.

Edit 2: I forgot an important detail: The first time I broke up with her, she literally made an account with a similar username and pfp as her ""kidnapper's"" (only difference being like 2 letters), asked if we could be friends and said that me and E were the cutest couple ever. This time she did almost the same thing and even made a video about me, I showed M once I realized and he said it's suspicious but to not make assumptions... Idk about that... The accounts were made the same days I broke up with her and her first account only changed like two letters of their ""kidnapper's"" username. (Example: let's say the ""kidnapper's"" acc was ii_Kitty_pop, the account she probably made was named idk ii_Kitty_lol..)",Idk_yet_aaa,6,1690251658.0,0.67,6792,1310,6792

Yet I see where he likes skinny models on his Facebook page. He only follows pages that feature skinny chicks. I don't see where he's following pages of women who look like me.

"No means No, Put on a condom means Put on a condom No means no, Put on a Condom Means Put on a Condom

Dated a dude for like 3 weeks. He was honestly so sweet and respectful so I was so caught off guard the last time we met.

We already started having sex just a couple days before, and I was clear I wanted to use condoms, which he said he was so happy about because he definitely wanted to use them too.

But after our first night having sex, I told him I've never had unprotected sex and I think it fucking blew a screw loose in his mind. Because the next time we were going to have sex he was about to enter me -- I tell him to please put a condom on. He says he will, he just wants to tease me a little more. Then he's about to try again, I tell him immediately again to put a condom on. He then just gets down on me and proceeds to try to start fucking me and coaxing me into it asking me to please let him because it will feel so good. I say no, speaking up for the 3rd time, and he finally gets off of me and puts a condom on. He was really staying turned on after moaning about  the fact that even though we wouldn't now how he could basically fantasize about us having unprotected sex in the future. I was confused by the end of the night and after he left it finally hit me what the fuck just happened.

I broke it off and just wanted to discuss what made him do that and let him know that was not okay, don't do that to anyone else. But just for the fact that he already knew I wasn't going to be with him anymore he didn't even give me the chance to express how his actions made me feel. It feels like someone just breaking my boundaries and then telling me I have to respect theirs by just shutting up so they don't have to deal with the pain they caused. His response as far as why he did it was to ask if it was such a big deal to lose the condom if we're both clean and I have an IUD. It's not that he couldn't have asked me, it's that you shouldn't ask me right as you're trying to force yourself on me, especially after me asking you to put a condom on twice,  AND already having discussed using condoms beforehand.

How can he talk like women's/reproductive rights are an area of interest to him and then do that shit to me. I've never had unprotected sex before, can you please let me choose when I have that experience instead of trying to steal that choice away from me?

Reported him on bumble and to the police.
I hope he never fucking does this shit again.

So disappointing that someone can come off like such a gem and then just disrespect your fucking heart and soul like that, just treating me like a fucking cavity to claim. Honesty, respect, empathy, is that so hard to give? I gave him more compassion even offering to just talk it over with him than that fucker even deserves with the way he responded to me.

"Anyone else can‚Äôt stand the dating process? It feels like a waste of time some days. I don‚Äôt even want to put the effort in anymore. I just want to go back to when I felt safe and satisfied. I hate that beginning/ middle stage when you start to get attached but then they start to get ominous. Maybe because they think they have you already so they start to act differently. Then eventually the ghosts start to come out the closet. And you think to yourself‚Ä¶ ehhh I‚Äôm good. Thanks for your time but I‚Äôm out. But then it‚Äôs awkward because you‚Äôve spent so much time together and with each others friends. You‚Äôre close enough to give an explanation but not close enough to feel obligated to elaborate. 

Idk its that phase when you start to get nervous because you‚Äôre moving into a more serious relationship but now everything they do or don‚Äôt do you hold to a higher standard. You get nervous you‚Äôre about to get hurt emotionally. Past relationship fears start creeping in. You start to not trust them and question more things because you care more now. You see parts he‚Äôs secretive about and instead of being direct and blunt about asking why you decide its better not to know and just cut ties. So you just begin to slowly disappear.

"I just want to be someone's priority... Hey hey! I've recently been thinking a lot about *why* I want to be in a relationship because I've always felt a sort of desperation behind it. I finally came to the conclusion that it's pretty much solely because I want to be prioritized.

I'm extremely extroverted and thus have a huge network of friends, many who I consider myself very close to. 90% of the time, I feel great and like I don't even need to date because I can always ask one of my friends to do fun date-like activities that I'd do with a bf/gf. Honestly, many of my friends *feel* like a significant other to me (minus like...sex lol) so it's great to have them around. But it's the rare times when I ask one of these close friends to make plans and they turn me down in order to do something with *their* significant other that send me straight to sad land. 

Like, I totally get it and they obviously should prioritize their partner, but it's just like damn...I'll always be #2 to everyone if I'm single. There's no one I can 100% outright rely on to be there for me. That thought makes me sad, then I get anxious, then I start frantically dating. 

Do any of the other singles out there feel this way? If so, is there a way to overcome it or a different way to think about it?",cloudboy37,7,1690772186.0,0.89,1289,245,1289
"I fantasized about my husband‚Äôs best friend, and my subconsciousness punished me I‚Äôm so sorry about my long post, but I just needed to put this out somewhere. My husband (27m), his best friend (26m) and myself (25f) have just returned home from a children‚Äôs summer camp, where we worked as volunteers. It was the first time I brought them to the camp (I‚Äôve been a volunteer at that camp since I was a teenager), and they both did amazing as volunteers. The best friend was so nice to me all week, since I had a bigger responsibility this year, and I was very nervous about it. My husband was also very supportive, but the best friend (let‚Äôs call him Tony) was even more. Every day he told me and the other volunteers how great I was doing, and how cool I was for doing it. He stayed up late with me every night to keep me company, when I was working on the tasks for the next day. He build stuff for me that I needed and was just very kind. Tony and I are also really close, and I actually see him as my best male friend too. 
And btw he is also our neighbor, so we live right next to each other. Like Tony lives on the other side of the wall with his girlfriend.
Well, the other volunteers from the camp all loved Tony since he was so hardworking, kind and fun, and they told me that over and over. 

On the last day of the camp, I cuddled up next to my husband, and I started fantasizing about being with Tony. I thought about us having sex. I LOVE my husband and I DON‚ÄôT wanna be with anyone else but him, but in that moment, it just crossed my mind. 
I fantasized for maybe ten minutes, and then I fell asleep. 

And then I started dreaming.. 
I dreamed that we agreed on switching partners, so that I would be with Tony and my husband would be with Tony‚Äôs girlfriend. My husband and the girlfriend left the camp early to go home. Tony and I left the next day, and when we came home, I missed my husband so bad. I sneaked into my old apartment, and nobody was home. I looked around, and noticed that ALL of my belongings were already gone, and the place looked totally different. It looked like her. I was shocked as to how fast my husband just ‚Äúgot rid of me‚Äù, and I went to the bedroom. It was still our old bed. On the bed was my husband‚Äôs phone. I took it and looked at the chat between my husband and the girlfriend. Right then my husband entered the room, and got down next to me on the bed. There was no emotion in his face, and he just encouraged me to look his phone through if I needed to. I looked through their conversation, and they were already so flirty and sexual. They seemed so happy together, and I could suddenly see that they‚Äôve had the best, most passionate sex over and over. 
I broke down crying, and I cried so loudly. My husband didn‚Äôt react or comfort me, but just looked at me and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it is now‚Äù. I all of the sudden knew, that in the moment I agreed to the switch of partners, I was dead to him. 

I woke up, because my husband shook me (because I apparently was crying in my sleep also). I continued to cry after I woke up and I felt devastated. My husband comforted me and held me, and he asked what I had dreamed. I told him about the dream (I didn‚Äôt tell him about my fantasy the night before), and he just said over and over, that he would never want to be with anyone but me, and that it was just a stupid dream.

I‚Äôve been feeling icky all day, and I feel so bad about the fantasizing. I feel like I cheated or something. My husband has experienced cheating in past relationships, and he is VERY touchy about it. He has been clear since day one, that if I ever cheated, that‚Äôs it. This is of course SO fair, and the right mindset to have,  but now I just feel so scared because of those thoughts and that dream.

At the same time I feel so depressed about the dream, because it felt so real, and I just keep seeing my husband‚Äôs ignorance towards me, the empty apartment, and the images of him and the girlfriend having wild sex. I struggle a lot with jealousy and retroactive jealousy, so it hits so hard on me - and I also feel heartbroken thinking about my husband and I splitting up..

I feel like I‚Äôm disgusting and a terrible person, but at the same time I feel like it‚Äôs natural to occasionally fantasize about others. But maybe it‚Äôs not?",sensano123,7,1690480118.0,0.68,4302,835,4302
"Hurt and confused This is decently long, but like the title says I'm really not doing too well and I really need some support. To anyone who read this. Thank you.

I haven't dated in around a year, by choice. I really liked who I became while being alone but recently I met someone. She's everything that I could ever imagine and more. And we've been dating for a short time but in the beginning she showed a lot of interest in me and wanting to be together as much as possible. And it was very nice, to be wanted just for who I was. We went slow all the way. Hugs to hand holding to kisses, to cuddling together till we fell asleep. I was falling in love fast. She really is special. Once we were talking about past relationships. She mentioned how someone asked her for a chance once he found out she was available, she said she wouldn't give him a chance and we kinda laughed. I asked her half joking if I had a chance. She said yes. Which made me very happy. 

Today we went to see a movie. While sitting I had a piece of candy on my lips that I wanted to share like those cheesy scenes in romances where you end up kissing. It was a playful thing but was I saw in her face was disgust. In that moment I just knew it was coming. 

We got back to her room and after some small talk she says there was something we needed to talk about.
She proceeds to tell me that while she likes to hang out and thinks I'm a cool guy, she's not ready to be anything serious. She tells me how she had been recently hurt and she doesn't know if she'll be ready for another serious relationship for a long time. It could be a year from now a week from now, she said. 
I told her I understood. 
She tells me that she hopes she wasn't leading me on and that she wants things to stay the same as in, cuddles and kisses. But nothing more serious than that. That she doesn't want to be in love and have to be thinking what that other person could be doing when they're apart. 
I told her that I understood, thanked her for her honesty. I said to her that I still wanted to be with her but I know understood where the line is.
We hugged and I left. 

I'm really really hurt. And I don't know how to deal with this. 
I'm writing this to ask about your experiences. To any women reading this, does it sound off? Is she lying to me? Is there a chance, and is it even worth it for me?
I know this was long and for anyone who read thank you.",Illustrious_Sale7532,7,1690677875.0,0.89,2415,482,2415
"Am I in the friendzone or what? I (25m) have had a crush on one girl (21f) from university. We barely knew eachother from class and this year I started to show some interest. A couple months ago I decided to start talking to insta dms and it didnt go well, she would answer after 4-5 days. Now, since classes are off and we are working in the same city I continued to show interest on meeting up and she finally agreed. We met up 2 weeks ago for the first time and it went well, she even showed me her appartment in the middle of the night, but nothing else. Three days later, which we barely spoke, she textes me asking if I would like to go party with her. I was blowm away by that offer and really happy and I said yes. So we went just the two of us and it went nice again. I didn't know what to expect from that night and since it was only our second date I didn't make a move, and neither did she.

"I feel lost, I was falsely accused almost 3 years and I‚Äôm just not the same person anymore. About three years ago when I was in my senior year of high school I started dating a junior, we dated for two years and I really loved her, she was my first proper relationship outside of flings and hookups.
Never cheated on her, never abused her in any way, worst thing I ever did to her was shout at the top of my lungs after she berated me in-front of one of my friends for an accusation that I was into her friend and jacked off to her‚Ä¶. whom funnily enough I fing hated but long story short that girl accused me of r***ing her 6 months after our relationship ended and on the day my father died, after consoling me and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be there for you and you can cry as much as you want‚Äù

I trusted her with things I had never told anyone about my family and my childhood, stuff that I never wanted people ever knowing about because of the impact it had on me and my family.
She dragged my mom and my entire family into the situation, she never went public with her lies but she made me look like the worst scum on this planet but my family and closest friends didn‚Äôt believe a single word because they knew the type of person I was morally. 
It really hurt to see my mother hear that because she was r***d when I was younger and it‚Äôs really impacted and dictated the way I treat women, it just sucks that she used my biggest weakness against me like that.
I‚Äôve not been able to trust and open my heart to a woman ever since, i feel heartless and I can‚Äôt even bring myself to tell them about it because I‚Äôm scared, not scared of them finding out but scared that history will repeat itself.

"Am I the only one who feels like today‚Äôs society diminishes the value of relationships?   Recently I went through a hard breakup in a long term relationship. We had dated for almost 3 years and she was my first love and my first girlfriend. As much as I still miss her, I can look back on that relationship and know it was a true, real, loving relationship. And when I think about what kind of person I want to be with and what kind of relationship I want to have moving forward I realize that it doesn‚Äôt line up with what society expects today. 

&amp;#x200B;

  For example, I don‚Äôt really want to be with a girl who has slept around with a bunch of people for fun. To clarify that‚Äôs something that I would never do either. I don‚Äôt really want a girlfriend who goes and gets blackout drunk at clubs and parties around the type of guys who only think about sex, which is simply increasing. Call me na√Øve but I feel like todays society decreases the value of relationships and lowers the amount of real relationships. Perhaps this is the reason why the marriage rate in the US has dropped nearly 60% in the last 50 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

  And while I know these standards are a good thing to have, I‚Äôm going to be going into college next year and with how prevalent all of this type of behavior is, I‚Äôm wondering how long it will be before I have the chance to find a real relationship again.

"I think that I was not my ex‚Äôs type We met online and he seemed like the man I have been looking for all my life. I was extremely hesitant about starting something long distance, but he convinced me that we were meant for each other and that finding a connection like ours was extremely rare. 

He repeatedly told me that I was his type. However, only 2-3 days after we had formally met in real life for the first time (and been intimate with each other), he commented on my body, saying that it was obvious that I did not work out and that I had bad posture (which is something I have never heard in my entire life), while simultaneously telling me that I needed to eat more to be healthier. I was by no means fat or heavy, I am just tall (not petite) and I did not go to the gym, so my body was not toned. He had very manipulative tendencies and would lie to me about the smallest things any chance he would get. He was so cold towards me when we were together. I blamed myself and thought that I was doing something wrong or that I was not good enough. At the same time, he was talking about how we were going to get married and telling me that he wanted me to move in with him and have his kids. Make it make sense. 

I have realised now that all his exes before me were petite brunettes and so is his current girlfriend, who was already moved in with him 7 months after I broke up with him. I am starting to think that I was never really his type and that he was not attracted to me, and that that is the real reason why he treated me the way he did. Why did he pursue me then? Why did he not end it himself earlier? Why did he introduce me to his family? Why did he try so hard to convince me that this would work? He should have left me alone. He is happy now with his gorgeous new girlfriend and here I am, still trying to process what even happened between us and going to therapy because of him. He was my first everything and I was so sure about him.

She did explain to me that she has been divorced in the past, so she told me she doesn‚Äôt want to label / define our relationship when I asked what are we.

"I'm (27F) Torn (40M)&amp;(30M) I dropped dating apps for this very reason, and yet it happens again... 2 great men fall into my circle at the same time.

I went on a date with P(40M) two weeks after my very toxic relationship ended. When he asked me out I was very honest and let him know what I went through, and that I wasn't ready for a serious or commited relationship. He wanted to try the date anyway, and it turns out, we got along really well. So we decided to keep seeing each other for fun.

2 months in, and he seems really serious now. Mentioned moving in... being against kids, but would have them if it was with me... I realize now we've gone too deep, despite my constant reminders that I'm not ready to be seriously involved.

In the meantime, about 1.5 months ago, I met M(30M) through a volleyball group. He was shy at first, so I didn't notice his interest, but now it's obvious. And honestly, I'd really like to date him too, just to get to know if he's a good partner or not. He does, however, belong to a religion that doesn't accept Atheists, and I know this will likely cause problems with his family.

I know I will have to have a conversation with P about this, and I plan on being fully transparent and honest. However, 1. He knows M, and 2. I could see P being a good life partner for me. I just haven't had time to get to know either well enough, but I feel P is so far along that it would seriously hurt him to hear this.

I'm not getting younger, and have never had a healthy or good relationship before P. I want to have children and be around for their grandkids, so it just ups the pressure to find the right partner right away. I don't want to lose the chance to be with either of them, but I know it's not right to not make a decision.

I know people who find themselves in these situations tend to be judged really harshly. It should be easy to just comit to one right away, right? I just wish it didn't have to be this way, and I just hope the right partner will be the person I chose in the end...

"If you date someone who's cheated before, don't be surprised. Learn from my mistakes you guys. About 6 months after beginning my relationship with my ex-fiance she revealed to me that she had cheated on a former boyfriend. I was super naive and told myself she never do that today because our love is real. (Feel free to roll your eyes) after being together for years we got engaged and everything seemed to be going well until her sex drive skyrocketing. I was working full-time where she was working from home, I had a significant amount of more physical stress on me and was really only in the mood between 1-3 times a week which was ""abnormally low"" according to her. I'm pretty sure you guys can guess what happened next. 

People who are prepared to cheat when a problem arises will always be setting something up for when their current thing fails instead of focusing their energy on fixing the current thing. It's a vicious cycle.",throwaaaay_7483882,9,1690907857.0,1.0,938,167,938
"My boyfriend downloaded hinge when drunk My new boyfriend (35) downloaded Hinge when he was drunk.

My single friend saw his profile and showed me at 7am. I called and confronted him straight away.

He admitted it and got defensive saying that he did it because he was confused about us.

I broke up with him then.

But - after some reflection he wanted to meet up. He was distraught/ embarrassed/ disgusted with himself and seemed genuinely remorseful.

We met up and he said that he has been feeling scared and insecure about our relationship but he feels the idea of losing me has made him want to be better for me.

He has called a therapist to discuss his insecurities.

I want to give him a second chance as I was once given a second chance at it meant the world to me and gave me a chance to prove myself.

But on the other side, my family and friends will think I‚Äôm an idiot for giving him a chance.

I have a kind heart and believe people make mistakes but I‚Äôm struggling a bit.

I do feel in my gut that he is genuinely sorry and wants to make it up to me.

"Confused with my relationship with my friend?? So when I was 21 (F)  I had a massive crush on my guy friend and I asked him out. He rejected me saying that he was in university and wanted to focus on his studies.

I didn't take that personal and we stayed friends but I kept my distance, as I still had feelings for him. 

Fast forward to 5 years which is now. He finished university and immediately asked if we can have coffee to catch up as I hadn't seen him for a long time. During the coffee catch up,  the impression I got was that he was flirting with me, he was acting all nervous and blushing hard.

The problem is , I no longer find him sexually attractive like he isn't my type anymore.  Yes I had a crush 5 years ago but I guess I got used to seeing him as a ""friend"" . He is really sweet , and I'm not sure if im being unreasonable especially because my parents really like him too.

"I‚Äôm not attracted to my type‚Äôs type I (23m) had a conversation with my friend (22f) recently and she brought up dating and I mentioned that I usually see a trend of most people who might be into me are not the sort of people I'm interested in, such as on dating apps or a little bit in real life. She said that if they like me, it means they're probably on my dating level.

What I didn't tell her is that I'm just not into these women. I'm not really attracted to their face, they're usually on the overweight side, which is fine and can be attractive since curves exist, but in my case, I usually don't find their body type attractive either since that's lacking in any capacity. They usually smoke weed and have some tattoos.

I don't know why that would be my dating level, since I don't smoke, I don't have tattoos, I'm thin, and not exactly exploring alternative types of lifestyle.

"Some women have removed their height requirements for good. ""It was the best decision I've ever made."" https://imgur.com/gallery/Mv1BAsw

""He needs to be my height or taller.""

""I only date guys 6 ft or taller.""

""I'm entitled to my preferences, and I'm never gonna date a short man!""

Sound familiar?

These are the sounds that men hear on a daily basis when trying to build connections with women.

However, some women have taken matters into their own hands. Some women, like popular Youtuber Abbie Herbert (The Herberts) have dropped her height requirements for men altogether. 

Earlier in her life, Abbie was absolutely adamant that she would NEVER, under no circumstances, date a man who is shorter than her.

Now, she's married to one.

Funny how love works, isn't it?

Even 6 foot 4 Youtuber Marie Temara has decided to give short guys a shot, and she's on record for saying that she's glad that she did.

Unfortunately for most women, they just don't want to budge on their height requirements.

"How to not be an asshole about this? So I(M 35) met a woman(F30) briefly, and later she added me on Facebook, and, while I normal don't do this, I somehow wrote and phoned a lot with her, while I was 3 weeks on a trip (that's why we wouldn't meet for real), when I came back for different reasons till now, one week later, we couldn't meet(she is working some nights and it's like 40km), anyway we spoke and wrote the whole time.

But just this weekend, I was bored at Friday and wanted to go out having a drink, and I played around with tinder, got a match, wrote a little bit, and somehow just asked her if we would have some drinks, she said yes and we went on our date, I really hadn't so huge expectations, but we have been head over heels somehow the last 3 days(she lives only 1 km from my place), I know this can lead to problems, but I am just feeling it right now.

So I don't really feel like meeting the other woman, but I somehow feel it's unfair, as I haven't given her the chance to meet in Real Life for a date, and I feel bad because we wrote so much, and exchanged a lot (I kind of told her that texting doesn't do much for me, though).

I also don't feel like, lying to one of the two. And the first woman also is making comments about me not answerig like before.

Is it a good idea to call her tonight, and just explain things to her, how would you do this without being an asshole, I don't want to host her either.

I kept insisting that I would pay and he said that he would pay for half then. We go to the restaurant and we're already late for the movie, so we had to rush and I already had the card ready so I just handed it to the waiter.

Now I feel like maybe I shouldn't have been so adamant about paying.

"WTF is it with guys coming off as interested and then putting in 0 effort to actually make something happened I‚Äôve experienced this before in the past but two different guys recently made me need to come here and rant about this. I (25f) have been ‚Äútalking‚Äù (by that I mean I‚Äôve been on one date with each and they flirt w/me on IG lol i just don‚Äôt know what else to call this) that have told me they want to hangout with me again and will always like my pictures, txt me and react to my stories with heart eyes but never actually make solid plans. They will message me saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out soon‚Äù or let me know they‚Äôre in town and want to make plans but then either cancel on me last minute/never follow through with making plans. WHY?! WTF is the point of reaching out to me and make it seem like they‚Äôre interested if they aren‚Äôt actually going to do anything about it. The last straw with one of them was when he texted ME first this weekend asking if I was in town for the weekend. I told him yes and asked if he was too. He said yes and asked how long I was staying. I told him how long and then asked how long he was staying. He goes on to say he‚Äôs planning on leaving Monday so it was probably the worst time for him to try to make plans. Like okay!? Why tf are you reaching out then. Anyway I was planning on just ignoring him but my friend persuaded me into giving him the benefit of the doubt on him just being a dumb guy and said I should just let him know I‚Äôm free today (Sunday) so if he was around we should do something. I figured it was worth one more shot. So I tell him and we plan to get dinner. I wanted to set a time because I usually spend the day with my family on sundays so I wanted to know when I should be free by, he says if it‚Äôs okay for him to text me in the afternoon once he‚Äôll know he‚Äôs free so I say that‚Äôs fine. Guess who got a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to hangout tonight :/‚Äú text! This clown ü§°. Im mostly mad that I gave this guy another shot after he‚Äôs repeatedly either left me on delivered mid convo or has fallen through with plans to meet up. 

Now I‚Äôm hesitant if I should even give guy #2 a shot beyond what I already have. We‚Äôve gone on one date and I thought it went great! He was even trying to ask me when I was going to let him teach me how to skateboard and saying ‚Äúoh we should go x‚Äù and spend the day in this town nearby. After the date I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a few days which I tried not to overthink it (even tho we had been texting almost every day before the date) an a few days later I hear from him. The problem is the convo was so dry and he took hours in between to respond that I didn‚Äôt even see his last text until the next morning and didn‚Äôt respond cause the convo was dead anyway. I was going to give up on trying further because I‚Äôll admit I tend to put up very high walls now when it comes to dating because of bad experiences in the past so now if someone isn‚Äôt meeting my standards or giving me the same energy I‚Äôm giving I move on. I told my therapist about this and she told me that when im in the ‚Äúgray area‚Äù of dating I can‚Äôt expect someone to give me 100% and be head over heels over me. To give them some grace. So anyway he ends up swiping up on one of my stories saying we should hangout soon. I tell him when I‚Äôll be back in town and he says okay to txt him and let him know. So once I‚Äôm back I txt him and we chat for bit and eventually i say ‚Äúbtw I‚Äôm back in town if you‚Äôre around we should hangout!‚Äù He responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely down to hang, I‚Äôm kinda busy the next few days but I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll link before you go back‚Äú. ??? I get him being busy but I would think that he would at least TRY to solidify some plans for sometime while I‚Äôm here? Am I being crazy in thinking this seems like he‚Äôs actually not very interested at all and just dropping this.

Dating someone with avoidant attachment style This is my first experience dating someone with this attachment style. She's really great but sometimes I struggle with the infrequent commincation. Normally when I date someone we can't keep our hands off each other and want to be around each other all the time. This feels so distant and at arms length. She brought it up in conversation and so I researched it and spoke to her more about it. I know you shouldn't press someone with this and give them space so that's what I'm doing. It just leaves me feeling somewhat lonely even though I know she cares and expresses it differently. Has anyone else dated someone like this?

"How to move on after ex (22f) broke up with me (23m) after proposing to me and making me travel across the world to be with her I (23m) dated my now-ex girlfriend (22f) for 2 years, and we had a wonderful relationship in my eyes filled with love, partnership and we really cared for each other, our only weak point was communication, but we were working on it steadly and improvements were showing.

after a while together, I moved countries for her, leaving behind my friends and family. I had also found a job and started working hard, I came from poverty but managed to save 100k ‚Ç¨ to eventually buy a house for us. I honestly saw myself in the long term future having a life with her and she always motivated me to be better.

don't get me wrong, i was far from perfect, i'm not the tidiest guy around, and stress sometimes turned me into a grumpy moster, but i was working on improving my shit.

my communication improved a lot since the beginning of the relationship, as well as my ability to talk about my feelings, which I had never been able to do before and i was seeing really good improvement.

the first time she broke up with me was 6 months ago, after which she went wild on tinder while I fell into a deep depression and was the worse i've ever been before specially since i was left alone in a country i had no one ( this made a bit harder for me to take her back due to the pain she caused me but i ended up forgiving her ).

a couple weeks after the first breakup, she moved in with a friend of hers who had a crush on her and said she realized she had made a mistake and wanted to give us another chance.

i took her back and we were having an awesome time after getting back together, and I tried my best to fix the problems that caused her to leave, but it is stuff that takes time, and I again was honestly seeing a lot of improvements on my end.

within 2 months of us getting back together, she proposed to me and I accepted, we got engaged, i started working harder to build the future i saw with her.

two months after she proposed to me, she went to visit her parents in Singapore and invited me (almost begged) for me to come.

the trip was really not ideal, i knew it would be a bit stressful cause work was piling up, but I wanted to be there for her specially since it was something she valued (her past). i sacrificed my plans and work. but as soon as i got there it was totally different than what she said, it was tense, and we barely had any time together.

we only spent 7 days out of the 13 days I was there together, which was a bummer for me since she was begging me to be with her. Towards the end of the trip, she broke up with me, saying she wanted to move back with her parents (I assume she enjoyed being a child again instead of having responsibilities). (she mentioned she liked having stuff made for her such as her parents making her dentist appointments and stuff like that).

on top of that she blamed me for everything, not cleaning the house, working a lot, not listening to her and being toxic, and she said i wasnt worth it.

i need some help seeing if i'm really that horrible, i indeed got angry with her from time to time and we had some heated arguments in topics we didn't see eye to eye and could've done a better job cleaning the house but that was it and it was stuff i was working on.

i just got a 6 figures job offer with relocation to switzerland but I know I can't accept it, i don't want to move to another country and be lonely and even more depressed, I even had to quit the projects i'm currently working on.  


i completely hate myself right now and blame myself for everything wrong that has happened, i haven't been able to live lately and can't stop thinking about her, how do i just forget all of this and move on specially after all i wanted in the future was this woman and building a life with her.",JohnnyCampello,12,1690293054.0,1.0,3881,755,3881
"Am I wrong for expecting to not go home hungry after I was asked on a date that included food? Didn't get any food for the entirety of the first date he planned? Went home hungry lmao

For context this is someone I met in public. I'm 25 and hes 39.From the start,the excessive over complimenting,future faking,and just extremely intense need to express his attraction towards me and constantly asking my thoughts on him and if I feel the same overwhelmed me a bit. I had to tell him to slow down,I've started my only 2 relationships very fast and I don't want to rush. 

He asks me to a movie and burgers afterward. In our convo in the parking lot,I mention if he likes movie snacks. He says no but asks about me. I say I enjoy nachos,but if I plan on getting food after I'm fine with a soda. Upon entering the theater,we see how insane the concession stand is,and although we had 30+ mins till the movie,he bypassed it and took me to the theater. I have my own money,so 5 mins into previews I tell him I'm getting up to get my drink. That is until a preview caught my attention,and another and another (ADHD),until next thing I knew the movie was starting. I was chewing gum and I just accepted that id be hungry for a bit. But movie was 2.5 hours lmao. I was starving afterwards but to my disappointment we got in his car and drove me home. He asks me what I plan to do for food on the drive (that confused me since I expected us to get something) so I mention me probably ordering something since the food places in my area are closed. Later in that conversation we're discussing diets/eating habits and I mention not having eaten all day (my fault,something I do).

"Should I date other men after a failed relationship? 
Hello everyone,

I (23F) have been broken up with a month ago, after a 3 months relationship. As it was my first ever relationship, and I had put a lot of value into ¬´¬†preserving¬†¬ª myself for the right person, I‚Äôve been feeling heartbroken for the past weeks. I know, especially given some exterior circumstances, that we will never talk to each other again. I will have to see him in college in September, but we will definitely ignore each other, there is absolutely no doubt about that. 

Even though I did have feelings for him, I thus know it is over and I will never get back with him. So I feel like I can reasonably start to date other people, and I will make sure that those people will not get hurt emotionally. I‚Äôm a very loyal person, and this failed relationship has made me realize I need to share and receive love. I do grieve the person I was with, but what hurts me the most is to feel that with him gone, the possibility of love and companionship is gone too. Which shouldn‚Äôt be the case.

However, even though I do want to start dating, I just don‚Äôt know how to. The only time I‚Äôve accepted to go on a date was with my ex, and it was extremely stressful to take the leap for me. I made so much efforts to make it work and to be available, and I fear I might be even colder now that I fear getting hurt.
I would happily welcome advice on how to take things lightly and to actually start a dating life. The only things I‚Äôm confident about right now are my appearance and mind, which is really good, but it‚Äôs so new for me that I‚Äôm scared nevertheless. And I don‚Äôt even know how to do it - for sure, there are those guys I randomly meet outside, but wouldn‚Äôt dating apps be a better way to get to know the person a little more and to select people who I‚Äôm actually interested in?

"When do you find it acceptable to have sex with someone you are dating? Do you wait for exclusivity? Hi, 

I (21F) am trying to work out how long I should wait before I have sex with a guy (24M) I have been seeing for the past few weeks. There is a lot of sexual chemistry between us both, but I have seen some people say you should wait until 5th date, or until exclusivity has been established, to sleep with someone you are dating. I'm really worried that if I sleep with him too soon, he might lose interest in me.

I have previously slept with partners on the 2nd date, and on the 7th date - and in each case, this had very little to do with why we were incompatible/ why the dating ended. It goes without saying, of course, that in lieu of exclusivity - I would be practising safe sex.

"Being a ""slow"" man...and wanting to fix it. I'm writing this after breaking up from a longer relationship and almost two years of being sort of miserably single: I'm not gonna lie. I should not have a problem meeting women. And I don't. I meet lots of women. I'm a tall, above average looking dude who owns a successful business in a creative field (32M). I have good fashion sense, I'm fit and like the outdoors, surfing, skiing, sailing, etc. I play in a band, I have a masters degree, a nice apartment in the centre of my city and have a lot of friends. Me writing this opening might piss some people off but it's relevant to discuss my situation I think. I live a happy life in almost every aspect, business is good, exciting creative projects are happening, but my love life is miserable. So what's the problem?

Women get frustrated with me. Or confused. They think I'm slow. I grew up with a lot of female friends so hanging out talking to girls come natural to me. Maybe too natural. I meet women, either through friends, social events, work or they just come up and strike a conversation at a caf√© or a bar or whatnot. And I respond. I like people so it's almost always a good time. The point of confusion happens after a while... contrary to what my bragging opening paragraph might signal I'm naturally a quite polite and humble person. I feel comfortable around women but I don't naturally code them as sexual partners. They might be a new friend. Or a new business partner. Even when I meet someone that I find attractive and might give me signals of interest my brain is slow when it comes to get into the mindset to make a flirty move and take the conversation from friendly to intimate or flirty/sexual. I typically want to hang out with someone two or three times before I'm there. I've come to understood that women get frustrated (several women I've had relationships say so, *""yeesh, lucky for us I was patient, I didn't know if you even wanted me"" ‚Äì my ex*) because I'm so slow. My experiences this past year is that the women I meet seem to except something else. Something quicker. Faster. Maybe it's my background that might lead them to expect a more aggressive behaviour. I'm not slow in business. I'm successfull in leading big projects with difficult people and I'm not a pushover. But something is different when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. That's another side of me.

I was just crushed because a beautiful girl with similar interests and a great mind that I like a lot ghosted me after our first real date. We've known eachother for 6 months through a working project where she came in and consulted. We had a strong connection and from the moment we met I understood she liked me. She would look deep into my eyes with the prettiest smile and come around and say hi when she didn't have to. It was clear that there was undertones of sexual interest. However, because we worked together and had a great collaboration going I didn't want to f\*ck that up and be unprofessional, so I waited until when the project was over before I asked her out. We had a great time and hung out for a whole day until late night, just winging it, doing various fun summery things around town and talking about life, ending up with a dinner and wine. When the time was late I called it a night, followed her to the subway and got that long hug where I felt that she wanted me to do a move. She did not want to let go. But I wasn't there. I wasn't ready. I asked her out again after a couple of days and I was sad to realize she's been ghosting me since. It frustrates me. It hurts me. I really like her and I feel like i dissapointed her. She's progressive but I know she likes conservative gender roles and I think she might've wanted someone more aggressive. She might've thought that I was someone else. Someone more like I am at work. I mean it might be something completely different, she might be in love with someone else or whatnot, she might've just used me for business reasons and wanted to see if I was down to f\*ck, but this happens over and over again so it's not just one case. I've met so many women after my break-up that I like and my brain picks up might be open to something more but by the time I'm there and am ready to explore it more they've already lost interest or misinterpreted me as not interested back. She's not the only one, there's been many other situations similar like this but she was extra special to me.

I don't have a straight question here but rather wanted to share my frustration and hear what you guys have to say, women and men. I guess there are bigger questions here as well about whats expected from men and women and gender roles in society and flirting. Do you have to be the one who makes the aggressive first move as a guy? I don't think ever a girl has kissed me first. I might point out that I live in a Scandinavian country so flirting is a bit more lowkey here than in some other places. It also might be that I hang out with too many women who have a certain view of successful men and how they ""should"" behave...they might be attracted to power or status and associate other character traits when it comes to flirting than I have. I'm open for critique and to hear that I'm all wrong:) I'm afraid that I will miss out on romance in life if I don't change and pick up on things faster. I want to fall in love with a nice person and have kids. What do you think? I'm considering trying to brake my pattern and force myself to try and be flirty quicker than what I would usually feel is ok when I feel it's wanted from the other person...but I think it will feel really unnatural to me. We'll see. Hit me with your thoughts.",mrcsrnne,12,1690745095.0,0.88,5701,1070,5701
"I (23F) had sex with (26 M) and now am unsure of where we stand I (23F) have started dating Jack (26 M) for a few weeks. This has been the first time I have clicked with someone since my last relationship ended. Jack has been great and we talked for 5 hrs on our first date and seemed to both be into each other. At the end of this date we discussed what we were seeking, both of us agreed we‚Äôre wanting someone to have fun with but open to a relationship but wanting to not rush into one. We recently had sex for the first time which was great. It wasn‚Äôt something that ended abruptly either, we spent the whole day together with him cooking for me and us watching movies and cuddling afterwards. Jack even kissed my forehead (ifyky), and was overall very sweet and had intimate moments. I know we aren‚Äôt exclusive and can date as he pleases. Personally I‚Äôm not great at talking to more than one person so as of now I‚Äôm only seeing him. However, after I saw him within an hour after seeing me, he had updated his dating profile. It made me feel like I did something wrong however, he has continued to talk to me since and we are supposed to see each other in a little over a week. I‚Äôm unsure how to feel or what to do.

"Correct me if I'm wrong On Relationships and Truth

We were sitting in the office canteen just chit chatting when I overheard someone saying do you know they're in a relationship and the conversation went on as follows,
Oh really ? For how long?
Last two years dude, started in the third year at the college fest 
Let's see how long they stick to each other 
-- why do you say so...?
Because I heard he is seeing another girl..she is in his team

I casually turned to see , they were a bunch of freshers enjoying the gossip
I started thinking why people think 'relationship ' as physical relationship between opposite gender?
Don't we have relation with our parents, children,spouse,friends, neighbours , colleagues?
The current generation or generation z as we call them have become so casual about relationships.
It's very important that we realize that superficial does not last long
We should maintain a certain level of respect for all relationship 
Sadhguru says 
""If you truly want the relationship to work 
Constantly remind yourself that the other is more significant than you"" 

If we are able to practice this I think not only will we be happy but also we would make world a better place by making people around us happy",Milletomania,13,1690555757.0,0.67,1231,214,1231
"Blocked less than an hour before hooking up‚Ä¶? *EDIT FOR CLARITY: I was trying to casually hookup with this man and there were zero expectations of anything more than a purely physical and temporary hookup situation.*

I have no idea what I did wrong or even just what happened??

I‚Äôve been talking to this guy (30 and I‚Äôm 28F) for a couple of weeks, we had met up twice prior, had a brief date the first time and made out for a while the second time. 

He continued messaging me and flirting with me, usually he‚Äôd message me first. I‚Äôd tried to get the hookup going once or twice but there were scheduling conflicts and once he cancelled on me rather suddenly but hey, it‚Äôs casual and nbd right?

Then yesterday he‚Äôs chatting with me and sweet talking to me, cool. Like I said this is a casual thing, he‚Äôs only visiting my town, so a purely physical relationship is what I anticipated. Just to be clear on my ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù here. 

He asks if I want him to come over last night around 11, I say yes. Literally 20 minutes later, after he said he was getting in the car, he messaged me saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt come sorry‚Äù and then he blocked me on messenger????

I am so confused. I didn‚Äôt invite him over, he asked ME, so I have no clue why he‚Äôd ghost me or block if he was interested? I would legit understand it more if we‚Äôd already hooked up, like oh I guess he got what he wanted‚Äîbut he literally blocked me BEFORE he got what he wanted? All he got out of me was the making out and then one slightly racy photo, not even a nude. 

Anyone have insight??? I am absolutely thrown rn.",cinnamonspiderr,13,1690294389.0,0.75,1575,300,1575
"My ex (18m) and I (18f) broke up but I am having second thoughts and I know I shouldn‚Äôt. My ex and I broke up after 3 years of dating. When we dated it started off from sending inappropriate pictures. Our relationship was very centered around sexual contact. Of course he loved me and I loved him I have no doubt about that as him and I didn‚Äôt only have sex but also had hung out and played games together quite often. We texted everyday and called one another everyday. We went to school together and would make time to always see one another between classes as we had none together. All around we seemed pretty great together from the outside perspective. We were considered the power couple of the school. Unfortunately during this all, we had fought and broken up several times. Our parents broke us up multiple times too as they saw we had been sending inappropriate pictures to one another when we are 15-17. We stopped sending and only had in person sexual contact. 

Here‚Äôs where the problem is, him and I both have mental health issues that we both need to work on and I know that he won‚Äôt work on his unless we aren‚Äôt together cause he always just considered me his ‚Äútherapist‚Äù or atleast I considered me his with how he said that he didn‚Äôt need one because he had me. But I always referred him to the idea of one saying that it‚Äôs great for anyone and everyone. He says he doesn‚Äôt need one. I know he‚Äôs insecure and an over thinker and I think the idea of needing a therapist and hearing it from his girlfriend made him insecure and upset. Anytime I mention the idea of one he would get mad at me. We also have had a lot of issues regarding me being sexually abused multiple times during our dating, not by him but by a family member and someone who I had considered a friend. This damaged our relationship a lot as he made me feel the assault by my friend was my fault. His dad sort of convinced him of this also saying that I ‚Äúhad to have been flirty with him‚Äù which is untrue. He doesn‚Äôt blame me for the family member one as It was when I was in the ages 8-10 years old during that period of time it was occurring. 

I have left him multiple times in the past but I had always came back to him. He has always made me smile and happy. There is more to the story of why we broke up recently but the just of it was that I moved to a different area and I started to realize that I had relied so heavily on him that I now know I didn‚Äôt need him as much as I made myself think I did. I can now make friends and find y own person as he was very protective and obsessive over me which I never minded until it came to where he accused me of cheating on him with anyone I talked to. 

Sorry if this is so jumbled I am very stress as I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I should probably just take a break from dating all around and try and work on what and who I want as a person but I am scared to officaillay commit to that because I don‚Äôt want to lose him. He has his flaws but I really do love him and care for him. 

Please help I don‚Äôt know what to do I don‚Äôt want to fully lose him and I also don‚Äôt want to be treated the way I was. What do I do?",Additional_Ad8577,13,1690398465.0,0.93,3153,630,3153
"My boyfriend was abused by his ex-girlfriend for over a year My (23F) boyfriend (24M) dated this girl he went to high school with for at least a year. He told me that she would throw things at him, punch him, charge at him, etc. There was emotional/verbal abuse involved too‚Äînot just physical. Sometimes it got to be so bad that he had to sneak out of his ex-girlfriend‚Äôs house and run away.

When we first started dating, he would flinch a lot (which I totally get, especially since he was abused) whenever I would go to kiss his cheek or touch his face. Sometimes, I would unconsciously throw things to him instead of handing them to him (ex. if he wanted a roll of paper towels, I‚Äôd toss them and he‚Äôd shield himself‚Äîyes, I was stupidly inconsiderateü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I felt bad). Randomly hugging him from behind would startle him at times too. I would feel so bad when he would get startled, because I know he has PTSD from his previous relationship, even though I never would hurt him. 

Recently, after 6 months, I‚Äôve been noticing he never flinches anymore. It‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt necessarily point out to him, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed, and I‚Äôve been super happy about it! :) I‚Äôm still kind of learning how to get him to trust me physically (I‚Äôve never dated a guy who has been abused before), so if anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated. I would probably think that the best way to get him to trust me physically is by continuing to treat him gently, which I naturally do anyway!",notacheesygirl,13,1690794093.0,0.89,1494,272,1494
"How do I make my wife love me again like she once did?part 2 First off, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commended on my first post and who gave me advice, I really appreciate it. It has only been a few hours since I posted but I thought I‚Äôd like to clarify a few things. I was considering couples therapy a lot and I did phone one of our local councillors who has a good reputation for situations like mine but unfortunately the prices that was put in place was way too much.

How do ppl just casually date and not get their heart broken? I was talking to this guy for a week and I know its gonna sound insane like I have menatl issues but he was special ok the only one I ever connected to on an app like that...and he said the same to me. We talked all day everyday about everything including trauma and family issues which obvisley made us feel close as well normal things. Maybe I wasnt in love but I think i was starting to fall for him. But he ghosted me and it shattered my heart he disnt even say I'm not interested anymore. Tbh he had a fair reason.....I just ended my past situationship 2 days to matching with him and I told him I wanted to get tested for stds first just to make sure before meeting him.....I thought I was being responsible but the thought that I might have something turned him off so much he ghosted me. He was special I dont talk to  others on the app like that the convo is more surfacey. But regardless it seems most or alot of ppl just jump into a new realtionship every few months and idk how ppl can do that without having their heart ripped out. Maybe it's me but I dont feel safe with anyone so I only let a select few even know me for real I guesse so when things end (even by my choice) it hurts so much.  I dony understand ppl who date 20 or 30 ppl? Like do u not open ur heart just hang as friends and hook up then walk away?

So I am 34 year old virgin that part don't really bother me has I am a Christian and I think sex should come with love and with love should come marriage but what does bother me is that I have never had a gf or even went on a date or had a kiss. I have trouble with social anxiety and it's worse around woman because I just naturally care more about what woman think about me than men. I guess that is because I don't really even have female friends even. I only have a few friends and it's just other guys no female friends. So I am not used to being around woman.

 I have also had a few bad experiences that has convinced me that I can't be my self around woman that I only creep them out and I feel like woman hate me. If I even where to start to see someone I know I would question everything has I am terrified of coming of to needy and scaring them away. I naturally have low self esteem and have had 2 different woman that only killed my self esteem even more and that will always haunt me while untill I have some sort of level of success that is so I can know it's possible for me to not creep a woman out and for a woman to actually be into me has I have a hard time imagining a woman actually likely me.",Zeldabotw2017,17,1690270955.0,0.7,1275,265,1275
"When I put ""looking for relationship"" on dating apps I have different experiences. Opinions? I'm curious Hello! this is a throwaway account but anyway, I'm looking for opinions and experiences to understand a phenomena. I would like to see men and women points. I'm completely aware that what I'm sharing has my personal biases and also my ego manifesting.

To give you some context, I have no issues ""getting"" women offline, mostly on bars and clubs, but online things are a bit different. Offline usually I hook up with younger attractive women (let's say  (15,10) years younger than me) that are able to give me an immediate validation as a man either by sticking around or sometimes having sex right away.  Online I tend do attract some good looking women, usually closer to my age (I would say on average 5 years younger) and with most things happen in a pace I can feel the woman really desires me. Feeling desired as a man it is really important to me.

I'm actually looking for a relationship and realistically I would prefer a woman closer to my age, so  most of my real dating (not hookup) prospects come from dating apps.

The problem is that whenever I put that I'm looking for a relationship on apps, and this is not something I always do, I tend to attract some women that I think are a good fit but I often have the impression they treat me differently.

I started to realize that some of them, because they know I want a relationship, they change their behavior in order to look more ""relationship material"" (I hate social stereotypes but they still exist) and at the end they fail completely to fulfill my need to feel desired as a man by taking the physical things really slow. To me it looks like they are either more interested in the idea of a relationship than being with me or they are purposefully withholding sex to make me to invest even more but I can tell from conversations this is not their default sexual behavior (example: usually they sleep with a man much faster but now they want to take things slow) which I think it is very manipulative.

I'm thinking now that I can't just put ""looking for a relationship"" because whenever I do this thing will eventually happen. I happened to me to be in a relationship, much younger, that after a while I realized I was not truly desired but an emotional support only and I would not like to be in this situation again. 

I understand that dating should have no comparisons but many men assess women's genuine interest based on how (fast) physical things happen. I know many women might say when they really like a guy they want to make sure the connection is real but what many men hear is simply: ""this other guy is worth of sex without commitment but you are not"". And to clarify, I'm not comparing 1 date with 3 (small difference with many contributing factors to why things happened differently) but rather 2-3 months of difference in time where there were many dating opportunities and time to get physical.

My final conclusion is that is is better, in my case, to always start dating interactions saying ""I don't want anything serious"", because then I see the woman true behavior, and let it build from there.

Yes and I know men, even though a woman might say she wants something serious, they can still lead her on to get sex, which is a bad behavior. I'm not playing a hypocrite here but I'm curious about what men have to say. Women feel free to share thoughts as well.

"is something wrong with me? im virgin at 23 Hello. Im 23 years old female. I never had boyfriend, never kissed anyone and I'm still a virgin. I feel like my body needs intimacy. I want to have sex but with right person, someone whom i'll love and who will love me back. I hate the idea of losing my virginity to completely stranger. I want to feel loved but somehow no one likes me. sometimes I even think I'll never find anyone and i'll die virgin. I feel im not attractive enough, earlier I thought i was pretty but now not anymore. lately I started having acne, and whenever I go outside I feel eyes on me In  negative way, as if they are judging me for having acne. When i see relatives whom I havent seen in a long time first thing they ask me is about my acne, that it looks bad and why it happened. I even went to the doctor but its not going anywhere. I feel like crying and screaming to let all of my emotions go so I could be completely empty. Not only acne but I also get more and more irritated at times, more stress and mood swings, could it be that im sexualy frustrated? what should i do?

"Went on a really weird date Yesterday I (24 F) matched with a guy (23 M) on bumble. He invited me over almost immediately. I said no but that I was free today. We agreed on coffee and then maybe going to my place. Usually I'd wait longer to go out with someone I met online but I was feeling spontaneous. I did tell him I don't sleep with guys on the first date and he respected that. 

We exchanged numbers. I texted him but didn't save his contact (I was going to if the date went well). He was overly friendly through text and acted like he knew we'd be dating for awhile. I politely told him to slow it down a little bit didn't cancel the date. 

On the actual date we kept a conversation flowing but he was extremely unemotional. It looked like he attempted to smile once or twice but couldn't figure out how to. I picked most of the conversation topics which is fine but it would've been nice if he had brought up at least one. Eventually he went to the bathroom, came back and said ""I appreciate you coming out but I don't think we're clicking. See you later."" I just said ""okay bye"" and hungout at the cafe for awhile. I had a feeling we wouldn't keep dating but it was still weird. Usually when a guy doesn't want to see me anymore (or vice versa) the discussion happens after the date.

"What‚Äôs the deal with the high maintenance look a lot of women go for? This is purely just my opinion. 

I dont understand the desire for a lot of women to put on a huge amount of makeup, get excessive lip fillers, huge fake eyelashes, wear designer clothing/handbags in every photo, post their expensive meals on their story, hair almost always curled like they just got it done for a wedding or event, wear weird dystopian outfits like a kardashian. Am I weird for wondering this? 

Lately I cant get away from these women. They hit on me, I try to flirt back, but all I see is their layered makeup, lips, eyelashes, huge done up hair, louis V handbag and I lose complete attraction forever. A lot of them are really really pretty but still put on a shit load of makeup and it just looks weird to me. Like I cant date someone that wants me to take her to the most expensive restaurant in town. I dont want to live in the city or near one. Thats all these girls want after I get to know them a little better. After asking what they do for a living its 7 times out of 10 ‚ÄúI do social media‚Äù. Like okay nevermind. 

Its that high maintenance look i just cant stand. I just need to look in different places. I need to get out of the city ASAP.

"My generation just adopted the dumbest behavior in dating I hate how in my (27M) generation it became normalized and accepted to leave someone hanging in the middle of the conversation for day(s).

I am talking with 5 different women and all reply after a day. I am honestly starting to lose interest in people like them and see it as a red flag. It usually goes in two ways:

1. They remain ""interested"" and even if we have a date my expectations are on the floor. We cover super basic questions which we could have covered in text or usually on my profile, I leave after 30 mins. just to receive texts about when could we meet again. The first impression you made was that I am last on your priorities list and then didn't bother to look up 1 thing about me on my profile. Like hell no.
2. Even worse if they are not interested anymore but I still am. Then they just disappear leaving me to figure out if I said smth wrong, if they are busy, if I should text them again, etc. I did nothing wrong to them, why do people think leaving the other in this limbo is okay? If you cannot copy and paste a text of ""I am not feeling it"" then just unmatch ffs.

I am not joking, I have never been rejected in my life, well I have never been rejected properly!

I am done listening to this bs of ""they don't owe me anything"". Well, it seems like they did owe me a whole day of frustration in the end, which I didn't deserve, so what's up with that?

Before anyone says I shouldn't get attached to them, I get it, truly. However, as a guy, 99% of the time I put in all the effort to find things I like about them to ask interesting questions and guess what...I start liking them!

I truly don't get why they put the long-term relationship flair if their mentality is ""we will see how it is going"" and not the ""I want to get to know this guy to see if it would work or not""?

"girlfriend(22f) seems fond of my friend (21m) and friend seems interested in my gf lol I (22m) went to a chill house party with my girlfriend(22f) and my friend(21m) from uni. girlfriend met him for the first time. my girlfriend found him funny. she told me multiple times throughout the night that he is very funny. which I know, otherwise I wouldn't be his friend innit. I'm not trying to be a hater but she even laughed at jokes that weren't funny. a proper laugh too not a ""oh let's give a polite laugh to not make it awkward"" we went to get McDonald's cos we we're hungry. I was waiting for mine and my gfs order and she went to go sit down w my friend. they sat across from eachother and spoke about whatever I'm not sure. we were eating and we spoke career and taxes and being there for our kids vs working away from home and not seeing the kids for some months. (we both don't have kids it was just a hypothetical topic for when we have kids in the future). we spoke a bunch but my gf cut me off a few times while I was adding to the conversation. usually when she does this she at least comes back to me and apologizes and asks what I had said. but this time she was  blatant abt it . and just carried on the convo w my friend. I also recall my friend saying something abt me only having 2 friends (not sure how it got there, but it lowkey seemed like he tried putting me down now that I think of it) then my gf added to it by saying ""yeh the only two friends are sitting at this table"". I found  it funny but saw it as a v weird remark at the same time from both, my gf esp. they both laughed ofc. I could be overthinking it bcs it was a low blow and it probably was just banter but I didn't make fun of anyone at the table I was chilling. I didn't think too much of all of it. but I definitely took note. 

later at the place I recall him saying something along the lines of ""don't let me steal your girl away"" not those words exactly but it had a similar 'oomf'. was very weird I just looked and ignored what he said.  my gf was right next to me too so I'm sure she heard it too but she said nothing abt it. didn't expect her to in that moment, but I kinda expected her to bring it up the next day. but ig she didn't find that as weird as I did.

I wasn't phased by it that night, cos I couldn't care less. ik where my gf stands w me. even if I caught my friend looking at my gf every now and then lol.

But td out the blue my gf asks me
 ""what does 'friends name' think of me?""
I reply ""why do you care lol""
""nah I don't care""
""then why are you thinking abt it?""
""i meant to say, 'what does he think of me for you?'""
""idk"" 
she went to sleep after my reply 

this part is probably not much to think of but it's what made me make this post to see what you experts think of this situation.

Do u think it wise to bring this up to my girlfriend or will it make me seem insecure?

is this normal on relationships? it's it something you just have to get over?

"Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place? I‚Äôm confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don‚Äôt do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I‚Äôve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I‚Äôm confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

She is now back with her ex.

What makes this worse is how I found out. She posted on her Facebook story that they are at the airport, all loved up, going on holiday together. 

I know it‚Äôs her life, and she can see who she chooses, but I would have appreciated a heads up, rather than it making me choke on my toast this morning. 

I‚Äôm just venting. I needed the outlet.

Edit: The lie is that she told me her ex was out of the picture. Also, we didn‚Äôt sleep together.",ElJayEm80,27,1690350918.0,0.84,621,126,621
"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly. Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He‚Äôs very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He‚Äôs also balding, I definitely don‚Äôt care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it‚Äôs not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he‚Äôs very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he‚Äôs okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he‚Äôs with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don‚Äôt talk about men who don‚Äôt make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he‚Äôs very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I‚Äôm not. 

Like damn, I‚Äôm not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

Am I wrong for breaking things off? Do all men watch porn? Am I looking for a unicorn in this day in age?",figuringitoutthx,27,1690488326.0,0.59,2443,497,2443
"My ex date is threatening me 31F Hey everyone! Im in a really weird situation right now. I started seeing this woman who is 31F and im 25M it lasted for 2 weeks. We had sex couple of times always protected. She took morning after pill for the first night. Nothing suspicious happened but we wanted to be sure. A day later she texted me i found condom inside my vagina. First day we were drunk so i said maybe it did slip away but im pretty sure that i did not ejaculate on that day. And a day later she took another pill.

Then she started acting horribly to me in an abusive manner. Told me that i should be paying for her doctor appointment, bacterial tests, hcg test and everything. And sent me her iban and i should send her money. Of course I didn‚Äôt cause it was so suspicious for me. She did a pharmacy test 2 days later since our sexual intercourse and it was negative i did show it to 7 different woman they all said its negative. She claims that it is positive‚Ä¶


So i offered her to split the doctor bills and she claimed that i should be paying for all. If not she will go to the police. I don‚Äôt even know if i did something wrong or illegal. Well i took her an appointment for 10 days later since our intercourse. The day of the appointment arrived and she said i should be cancelling the appointment cause she had her period. 

3 days later she texted me her period lasted for 2 days and i should be getting an another appointment. And she claims that she started vomiting. (Its been 3 weeks since we had intercourse, every woman i asked said that she is bullshitting since it doesn‚Äôt start that early).  I asked her if she can do another pharmacy test so we can have an idea if she is pregnant or not and she rejected it and called me idiot and said that they are not reliable at all. And if im not paying her doctor bills that she would go to the police.

So i asked women around me and they all told me to block her cause she makes no sense. Im completely lost like why would she reject to do a pharmacy test before an hospital test if they are suspicious of pregnancy‚Ä¶ 

Thank you all in advance i hope i will get some point of views.",Zuccos,29,1690376482.0,0.84,2151,420,2151

"UPDATE: She asked to be exclusive, I agreed. Then she changed her mind a week later. Big date coming up, and I want an answer so I don‚Äôt waste my time. Hey All!

So posted a few weeks back about a girl I met on Bumble and how she flipped-flopped on wanting to be exclusive.
I appreciate all the advice you guys gave!

We ended up going to the concert/festival together and had a pretty great time.
But - something very important came up that made me change my mind about the whole thing. 

I learned she is still in communication with her ex and clearly not over him. She talked to me a few times on previous dates about how she is still upset with him for cheating on her, but I just took those conversations as her opening up to me. However, at the show she made an effort to tell me that her ex was texting her during the show and again talked about how she is angry at him and really hopes ""karma teaches him a lesson."" 

This was the main deal breaker for me. I know some people get over their exes by jumping back into dating, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. At this point I realized that she's probably just dating around and looking for a distraction. The day after the show I asked for some space and took about a week off from talking to her so I could think things over. That Friday I made the call to end things since she wasn't ready for what I was looking for. 

Thankfully, she was understanding about it and things ended OK. I chose to remove all contact on phone/social media etc. 

I'm still bummed that I gotta start over as I really liked her, but I know that it was best for me to call it there and move on.",AnOrangePenguin,29,1690476361.0,0.98,1644,320,1644
"I've noticed my mood depends on guys behaviours. I've been noticing my mood depends on guys lately.

Before all this, I was doing quite good. I didn't had any guys or contact and was quite doing mentally okay.  
I have history of having really up and down periods. I also got some help from professionals with it. Because I got certain 'autism' that makes me feel 'emotions' very intense. Also gained some PTSS because of some really bad experience with an ex boyfriend that was a narcistisc that completely changed my life.

So my mood can be just up and down. Before this it was doing quite good. I distanced myself with guys, didn't have my old life anymore that depended on FWB, going out, and one night stands. And really went better mentally.

Until you meet someone unexpectedly when the first guy came with interest in me in my life. I made myself the promise I only meet up with guys if there a real potential to it, and say that to them also very clearly. So only serious dates. Nothing less.

So the first guy ive met, and also met up with, was quite fun. He told me after that, he wanted to date for real, and see where it goes. Unfortnaly we didn't live very close to each other (4 hour drive) but the contact was fun at first. But ive noticed his way of staying in contact wasn't the way I wanted it, His way of staying in contact online (whatsapp etc) made me trigger my PTSD somehow.

But what I'm noticing, when everything goes well in between us, my mood was so perfect.  
But when there was a slight change (or thinking there was, good in overthinkgin) my mood was downhill.  Like really downhill.  
Even at some point that I couldn't even do my job at that time when is was at the office. My mood really depends on how he was reacting to me.

I was feeling very down again, like almost at the tip of being depressed. Because my mood depended on him and how he was reacting to me.

I had several nights crying but the next day my mood was perfect again because it was okay again.

At some point I made to decision to stop dating this guy because our way of staying in contact wasn't matching for me. It was really hard for me to do that, but I couldn't handle it anymore.

Still noticed myself checking out his location something, because I was afraid that he was already seeing someone for example or Idunno, I just kinda secretly wanted to stay in contact, even I knew that wasn't a good thing to do.

Then I met suddenly someone else. Ive noticed I kinda forgot about the first guy real easy, so that was a relief kinda.

But now, with the new guy, ive notice I get in to deep with my emotions, that I know that if this gonna be fucked up (that it is kinda getting.. im afraid) im really afraid that I well be downhill again mentally.

I don't know what to do. I'm gonna be starting a new job in sept, and I just don't want such thing a distraction anymore..

It's just so not fun that me emotions can be everywhere depending on such things..

"My ex-GF(34F) refuses to tell her male roomie that I(25M) am in a relationship with her. Was I wrong for breaking up? The girl I've been dating long-distance for a couple of months refuses to tell her male roomie that we are together, and I decided to break up over it. Was I wrong?

  
This all started months ago when she told me the story about him. A couple of years ago, after a breakup, she decided to move in with a guy she knew was interested and she hoped it could work out. He turned out to be very weird and she didn't want to start a relationship with him after all, but she had to keep living with him because she couldn't find a new place to stay. Either it was really shitty or super expensive. They've been living together for 3 years. I accepted it and thought nothing of it. She has told me he is an incredibly jealous person who becomes angry over the smallest things, thus she could not tell him we were together. She said she would find a new place to stay, and then tell him.  


  
We are dating long distance, and this week she had planned to go on a trip with him to my country. This was planned before we got together.We only see each other once a month, and I thought it would be nice to be able to see each other. I suggest we could meetup, but she said it would be impossible to meet without the guy. He described him as so dependent that he would follow her everywhere. She couldn't even go for an evening walk without him joining. I then suggested we meet with the guy and just pretend to be friends, so that I could get to atleast see her. She said that was a cute idea and I went along with.

  
Until the date came closer and I started feeling really shitty about it.... why do I have to pretend to a random roomie that we are not together? How angry can he possibly become so as to hide our relationship from him, but at the same time she goes on holiday with him for multiple weeks?

  
A couple days before we would meet I told her I feel frustrated about the situation and I have no idea why this has to happen. She said she is frustrated too, and that it feels weird from the outside, but now it is too late. She has lied to him about where we had met, and lied to him continuously in the past when she went on trips to my place. She would for example say that she was visiting family in her home country, and then fly over to my country instead.

  
The date came and I started telling my friends about the situation. Everyone around me has described this as a massive red flag. When she landed I told her we have to talk, and I asked her if she is together with the guy or what is going on. I got a crying voice message in response where she told me I had basically ruined her whole holiday in a matter of seconds. She had always been honest with me about him, and she couldn't believe I accused her of cheating and lying. I said my question was never intended to hurt her, but this whole situation is extremely weird and I can't comprehend it. I need clarification.

  
She said that this is my issue, not hers. That I have issues and my insecurities are messing with my mind. Suddenly confronting her and ""exploding"" on her was exactly what she grew up with and she can't be with someone who triggers all her trauma like that. I again said that it was never my intention to be mean, but my mind changed about pretending we were friends, and the whole thing felt crappy.

  
I started talking more and more to people around me, and everyone keeps saying I am borderline being manipulated and that these are huge red flags over and over. My mind feels like mud. I have no idea if I am at fault or if I did anything wrong.  


  
After some thinking, I decided to end things. I told her that even if she was together with the guy or not, to be called an insecure, problematic person she can't help by bringing up such a question is extremely over the line and I will not allow someone to treat me that way. I blocked her on social media and said she could reach out to me by mail.  


  
After I blocked her I got a super long message from her best friend trying to explain the situation. She said that the guy is an incredibly jealous person, who she has gone on holiday with multiple times and known for several years. He would become jealous over the smallest of things, and if my ex upset her, he would be impossible to live with. The best-friend told me it was not fair to treat my ex this way.

  
My mind feels so incredibly torn over this. On the one hand, I think most people would find this situation extremely weird. Traveling on a mulitple week holiday with an ""emotional tyrant"" who cannot know about us, and who is hell to live with. On the other hand, I can see how I shouldn't have confronted her so directly right before meeting me, but was it really such a harsh question to ask?",ThrowRA_RoomieDoomie,31,1690894646.0,0.85,4837,931,4837
"Asked a guy for his number whilst he was working at (UK) supermarket This morning I asked a guy for his number whilst he was working, it was early so there wasn't anyone around to hear but he said ""sorry I can't give my number out"", I said no worries and have a nice day.. I think it caught him proper off guard as he wasn't expecting it - so just wanted to ask what is the best way to navigate this kind of situation if they can't give their number at work, but you find them attractive?

The other thing I have been thinking about is he didn't actually say no. It was the first time in my life I had ever asked for a guys number and I was SUPER nervous! Im 29M and he is a male, so it was a big deal for me as I've always been too anxious to even think about asking for another mans number in person, I've always relied on apps.

"I really like this guy at work that's 35 years old, but he said he's never had a girlfriend. There's a guy at work that I really like and has himself together. He's told me that he bought a house 5 years ago and moved in his mother and two younger sisters. I asked him why and he said so they would have the opportunity to save money since his mother and sister were always broke growing up. One of his sisters is also 11 years old from a different father and said one of the reasons he moved them in was so that his 11 year old sister could have her own room. I asked him what about dating and girlfriends and he says that he's never had a girlfriend. When I asked why, he said he was always more stressed about being poor growing up, but when he started making good money in his late 20's and bought his house at 31, he is a lot more open to a girlfriend, but now he's trying to buy a house for his mother.  

His sister however is a strange case because he said she's only a couple of years younger than he is and even though she gives him money for rent (He says he doesn't charge his mother rent), she doesn't have a job and hasn't worked in years. He did say she is doing coding classes from home but says she has been doing that for years. I know I was wrong to ask, but I asked him if she was disabled and he said she is not and is just a normal girl.  
So what's the deal with this guy? He's very sweet and respectful and keeps to himself for the most part.

Not a sexist rant or post. I respect women, I was raised to do it. Women deserve every right and opportunity that a man has. Feminism is still important in many parts of the world, and we should strive for a better world for women everyday. Not arguing against that in any way.

However, I (18M) feel like I‚Äôm cursed by a biological imperative. I don‚Äôt want to be attracted to women. Fundamentally, it‚Äôs just something that feels imposed on me, and I have no control over it. I‚Äôve been very disgustingly ugly for most of my life.

I was so ugly and forgettable before, but now I‚Äôm not. Women are so kind now. Why are they like that now? I don‚Äôt like it when women are nice to me, or smile at me, or ask me out. I wish every woman just hated me blatantly, like spit on my face or something, because then I would be comfortable due to the familiarity. Instead I have to navigate this new reality where women aren‚Äôt repulsed by me.

So I've been seeing this seemingly great guy for for the last week - we've been meeting up every day and he's stayed over twice. But he doesn't clean up his own dishes or even move them to the sink when he's eaten at my place. He leaves the dishes and glasses he's been using on the table and waits for me to clean up while he remains seated. Is it normal for me to expect him to help out? Or at least to offer to do so?

To be clear - it wasn't pre-planned that he would come over. He's just wound up here after a few dates.",InformationGreat9855,45,1690885432.0,0.87,608,125,608
"Shower thought: I'm finally old enough to date the men I actually want This is my secret controversial opinion lol. Getting to my mid-20s has finally allowed me to date late 20s-early 30s guys. My partner now is in that age range and I absolutely love it. I've always been annoyed by the lack of maturity of the younger guys who surrounded me. I've secretly liked older guys the most for many years now but, obviously, I couldn't date them before. And they wouldn't date me, either. But now I have finally found the mature, stable, sexy (silver foxes rule ;) ) partner I've always dreamt of. And he likes me back!! Life is nice.

Edit: wow, seems like my opinion really is controversial haha. Some of you commented that age does not equal maturity and I agree with that. However, there really is a huge difference between a 20 yo and a 30 yo. Surely, we can agree on that? As for why I couldn't date them before - unbalanced power dynamics give me the ick. As a 20 yo, I had no business dating men 10 years my senior. I was a na√Øve a child by comparison and I knew that, so I purposely didn't pursue them. Lastly, the silver fox comment seems to have impressed some of you lol - some people go gray very early in life. Such is the case with my partner and a few other people his age that I know.

"Has there been a rise in Incels and femcels? A buddy of mine just showed me a text from a woman he rejected and it was fucking insane. She wrote a whole ass novel on how much of a piece of shit my friend was. They literally had 1 date and it was terrible. My friend said that she showed up late and smelled like weed. He stated in his profile that he didn't want to be with someone that smoked weed, so he thought it was rude for her to show up smelling like weed. The woman was texting him that he was going to die alone and that he was a LVM because he only made 70K a year and drove a 2021 Toyota. She also made fun of his height, even though he's literally 6 feet tall lmaoo. 

My sister showed me texts from a guy that found her dating profile. She has never even met the guy irl and the guy was already calling her names and trying to make her feel bad. Like the dude sent her 10 texts and was calling her names and telling her that she was a LVW

I can't go to a lot of places typical for dates and have to plan everything in advance and make sure where we go would be accessible. I'm also worried that they might find it to hard emotionally to be with someone in a wheelchair with the comments and everything.
 I really want to be able to date them and we plan to go out to do archery tmr but I'm still very nervous.

UPDATE: we went out it went amazingly. Went home with them after (omg do they have a nice house single story with basement!!!

"Welp he finally told the truth I knew it but somehow I‚Äôm still devastated like I didn‚Äôt. Me and this guy started talking the beginning of this month.

I hoped we could still continue to be cool with one another but he started to fall back. Texts got shorter his effort wasn‚Äôt there like mine. It got to the point that I was basically talking to my self and he was okay with it. I decided not to give up until he did. So everyday I tried talking to him. For a bit he played along. Last night I didn‚Äôt reach out anymore I was tired of feeling so rejected. That‚Äôs when he called me. We talked about a bunch of nothing but he kept hanging up telling me to hold on. Till finally he hung up told me to hold on then never ever called back. Today I reached out to see if I can get a response. I texted ‚Äúdtf‚Äù what do u know suddenly he was great at responding and said ya he was down. I  pointed this out to him. I think it triggered him.

"As a real Demisexual..... Dating apps are completely useless After a lot of therapy and working on myself and pointedly waiting to start trying to date again after my divorce. Dateing apps are completely useless. 

It's so weird for me. I am not attracted to physical features at all. If anything pictures are a complete turn off. I want to know what your dreams are, what your goals and aspirations are. Who is your favorite person, where do you want to be when you grow old. 

I find that, literally all men in the dating apps that I sometimes match with, are all looking for just that one thing. Don't get me wrong. When I finally grow attracted to someone I turn into a succubus that only can think about one thing. However if I am not attracted to you, it's like you have zero sexual identity on my radar. 

I use to be able to force myself to do casual encounters, but those were not anything fulfilling or memorable in the slightest. Now I just can't. The idea of casual anything makes me want to throw up.

1) I feel like socia media ruined it. 

2) I feel like pureness and dating to marry is not a thing anymore. 

3) I also feel like everything is just about sex.
People don't want to get to know each other anymore, as it's straight to sex. I know sex is important but i'll never understand people that does it without feelings. Respectfully, not hating on it. I just don't get it how. I prefer intimacy with someone special that loves me as well.

4) I also feel like people don't  try to fix problems in a relationship anymore, they go straight to cheating when things don't go their way.

5) I have barelt met gentleman guys.

"Cultural Differences in Dating: Need Advice from U.S. Locals Hi everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl from Europe who recently came to the U.S. as an au pair. It's been a really exciting journey so far, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how boys here interact compared to back home.  
In my home country, it seems like boys are quite direct and straightforward when they're interested in someone. However, here in the U.S., I've noticed that their approach can be quite different, sometimes more nuanced or indirect.  
I find it somewhat challenging to interpret their actions and intentions. Are they just being friendly or are they interested in something more? I don't want to misinterpret any signals or make any assumptions that could lead to awkward situations.  
I guess what I'm asking is: could anyone give me some insights or advice on how to navigate these cultural differences? What signs should I look out for that might indicate a boy is interested in more than just friendship? I'd really appreciate any input, especially from those who have grown up here and understand the dating culture better.

I just need time to deal with this fact that‚Äôs all!!! I love him unconditionally!



I‚Äôm madly in love with my current boyfriend just to state that. 
The story is that, we often joke about having sex in public where everyone can see us, we both know that wont happen in the middle of the day in crowded place, so it was fine until he asked me if I had ever had public sex. I was in shock bc he asked me that but I guess it‚Äôs fine, so i told him I didn‚Äôt (which is true), anyways he was like ‚Äúnoo jokeeess, really??‚Äù, and I was quite surprised. Firstly, I don‚Äôt have much experience with men in general, not to talk about some adventurous activities like that, so i asked him (which I deeply regret) did he had it with some of his exs, and he told me he had it in H&amp;M and in the park. I was stunned. My jaw literally dropped. I was too shocked to talk. 
Just to state, i have nothing against public sex and people who like that kind of stuff, BUT, from my angle, that kind of thing should be done with someone you are in a long relationship (like 3-4 or 5 yrs or more) or with someone you firmly know you gonna stay with. That‚Äôs just how i see things. His longest relationship is with me (3 months now). From what he told me, all his relationships would fall apart after a week or 2 (in the best case) because he was neither serious about them, neither were they. 
So the problem now is, after he told me that, when i look in his eyes, all I see is him, with someone else, in H&amp;M cabin. Last night, and tonight, I can‚Äôt fall asleep without having sex scene in my head where he is with some other girl in H&amp;M. 
Now, people will tell me to talk about this with him, but to be completely honest, I can‚Äôt bare to listen any more about his past experiences with any of his ex girlfriends. I told him that today that I don‚Äôt want to know anymore more about them and if he wants to tell me something about them like a funny story or whatever, to think twice before telling me and if he thinks it‚Äôs the best, just to lie to me. I was, and I am crying myself to sleep.

"I(22m) have been seeing This girl(19f)for a few weeks now. I think she wants me to be her boyfriend. She's a virgin and 'desperately' wants to have sex, but I'm conflicted. 

We have been going on dates (5 in total) since last the last week of june. I think so far so good in terms of the time we've spent together overall. 

But last Saturday. I showed her my apartment for the first time. We shared a few bottles of wine. I played my guitar riff for her. All seemed normal. 

Then she asks if I want to have sex with her. Like just like that. Quite randomly and brazenly. She seemed a bit drunk so I laughed nervously. Obviously she told me she was a virgin in one of the early dates so It kinda shocked me how casually she was talking about sex given she's a virgin. Also I didn't want to sleep with someone who was very likey drunk too. Doesn't seem right.

So I  just keep playing my guitar and she starts semi taking her dress on and off. Danceing with a combustion of laughter. Honestly it felt so uncomfortable. You laugh yourself to hide the awkmoment. 

She then starts cuddleing me on the sofa I was sat on(with my guitarüé∏). She then shortly falls asleep on my left shoulder. 

I then decide to go to sleep. Except I decide to pick her up. Put her in my bed while I sleep on the sofa. Out of respect I suppose. 

We then wake up we talk for a while about random things going on in the world. I tell her how funny was she was last night and she just laughs and before she leaves tells me 'we need to hangout more' and I should 'come to hers and meet her parents' I tell her I'd be open to that. 

Then literally just before she leaves my apartment door.  She says jokingly or in jest says 'her bed is big enough for us to fuck'. 

I'm just so so headfucked by her. Does this mean she sees me as a boyfriend by how she acting and talking(about seeing her parents)? I've never knew a girl like this. 

And is OK for Me to have sex with her given she doesn't seem the most mentally stable at times. I wouldn't want to hurt her little sweet soul in any way.",Formal-Crab-181,96,1690569569.0,0.89,2063,403,2063
"My best friend got together with my ex and hid it from me for 7 months. I dont know if this is the right place to post this and im sorry if it isnt.




I have been friends with this girl for 7 years. We have a great friendship, i opened up to her, we went on vacantions together, shared personal information and so on.   

I had a long distance relationship with a guy which she knew of, it was a healthy relationship id say but we broke up because life got in the way. After a few months, he messaged my best friend asking for support which i found weird as hell. I did tell her i wasnt comfortable with her offering him support and i respectfully asked her not to talk to him (bear in mind that i didnt force her, i only communicated how it made me feel) because he has friends he can go to for support and his family. I thought it was weird to ask for support from my best friend but okay. She did end up replying to him and she told me she felt bad for him but she told me she wasnt going to talk to him anymore in order to respect me. Fast forward to today, she confessed to me that she kept talking to him and that they got close and then got together (on the 1st of january). At the time when she started speaking to him, she was in a relationship and she lied to me saying that she broke up with her ex-boyfriend in february when they actually split in early december.

I want to add the fact that i do not have any feelings for my ex and it has nothing to do with him, but with her. I am in no shape or form jealous but i feel disgusted by what she did.

It‚Äôs made very clear that I‚Äôm not invited when this happens.

"I went with my gut and ended it ‚Äì but did I overreact? So I‚Äôve (24M) been talking to this girl (23F) for about 3-4 weeks now and decided to cut things off..here are the things I noticed along the way:

‚Ä¢I initially tried to set up a date for us by getting an idea of her availability and she just never gave a straight answer. However, she did let me know that she would go out for pickup soccer and would invite me out to play. And these invitations were kinda like ‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôll be if you want to come,‚Äù not like a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this together‚Äù invitation. 

‚Ä¢we went to the mall to pick out an outfit for her to wear to a concert (I did not pay, btw). By the time we were finished, I said that I was hungry and was gonna head to a restaurant to grab some food. She followed me there and we got our food. When we got outside, I found some tables for us and she said ‚ÄúOh, you wanted to eat?‚Äù This was confusing to me. I figured if you came all the way and got food with me that we‚Äôd eat together. After we sat down, she was glued to her phone, the communication was dry, and she hardly touched her food. She eventually apologized for being so distracted and mentioned that she was thinking of a guy she had previously ended things with who was moving away. I came to the conclusion that I was the rebound and stood up to leave. She stopped me, saying that‚Äôs not the case and that she wants a relationship, but she needs time. I held onto my skepticism and still decided to see how it went.

‚Ä¢From there, nothing really changed. I initiated most of our conversations. I found myself double-texting. Sometimes I‚Äôd get responses the next day like I wasn‚Äôt just ghosted the day before.

She went on a trip recently and hadn‚Äôt said anything to me the whole time. I just brushed it off as her wanting to focus on her vacay. I did speak to her once she got back and it was more of the same. Dry, one-word responses.

I finally said enough is enough and called it off, explaining that it felt like things were one-sided in both effort and communication. She said I was quick to judge and I told her she wasn‚Äôt quick to show me otherwise. Did I overreact? Did I not give things enough time?

"We finally kissed after 5 dates. Am I being hasty if I walk away after she said she‚Äôs processing things? I (M23) have been seeing this girl (F22) for a few weeks now (met on Bumble), and we‚Äôve been on 5 dates. Chemistry was there instantly, but she wanted to take things slow on date 2. I was okay with this. On date 3, I asked her what going slow looked like, which spiraled into her saying she‚Äôs not 100% if she‚Äôs ready for a relationship, but that she is dating to see. 

Fast forward to date 5, I asked her if she still liked the pace we were going at, which spurred another conversation about dating goals. We talked for hours about what we want. Suffice to say, we both agree we want to continue seeing each other, but she feels like she‚Äôd be leading me on if she‚Äôs not 100% sure what her long-term goal is. She says she could very well see a relationship come out of this, however. She admitted she‚Äôd been on a few other dates, none of which made it past date 1. She reassured me that there is a reason I made it to date 5 and no other guys made it to date 2. But she even said she‚Äôd be okay if I went on other dates. 

After we had that talk, we kept talking and returned to our normal conversations. Things got intimate, we started holding hands, and then we kissed. She admitted that was the first time she kissed someone in almost 3 years (and again I‚Äôm the first guys she‚Äôs been on several dates with in that same time). I feel like the kiss has complicated her feelings further. She texted me that she‚Äôs still processing everything, and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it.

"My friends are dissing on me (42m) for rejecting a woman (45f) because I'm a virgin who never had a relationship. No matter how I write the title, it still reads weird to me. 

Anyway, 

I had a lot of trouble younger. Between my head that wasn't in a right place, dropping out of school, and a slew of other problems. Others were dating and so on, I was trying to stay alive. Over the years, I managed to get myself on the right track again. I got my head in a healthy place, I got back into university and managed to land a job that allows me to travel after years of not really knowing what I was doing in life. I put some money to the side and bought a house with a garden for myself in a small village.

However, it took me nearly 40 years to get to a place where I felt good, and it took pretty much all my daily time. I did try to date during it, because even other dudes who faced the same issues as I did managed to do so. Online, real life, show confidence, the usual.

I managed a lot of things in life, starting from a bad place. I'm proud of that, but I never got anywhere in dating. After 40, I gave up on it.

My friends know and don't mind. When their families leave them some time, we get to spend some together, and for a few of them the kids are starting to be grown-ups so I get to see them more often now.

They introduced me to one of their friends, who happened to also be single and share a number of hobbies with me. In short, we spend some time together, and down the line she asked me out, I said no. 

I'm over 40, and don't feel like starting to learn now how being with someone actually works, I'm twenty years late for that and she wants an adult, not an 18 year old kid. As far as I'm concerned, that ship has sailed. 

I didn't tell her that, I only said she's cool but I wasn't interested in her like that. 

Of course, my friends learned about me not going for it. They've been asking me endlessly why I haven't tried something, if just for the sake of experience. In a few days they will forget about it and drop it, I hope.

"I am deeply regretting telling her the truth. How do I make her calm down?! I just started dating a girl and told her that I had a thing going on with someone else while we met, but after the first week together with her I broke up with a previous girl. Our energy just did not match and I feel alot better with a current girl... 

Now she is going crazy and thinks that she might have caught some kind of STI from me (I am 99% sure me previous girl was clean and before her I did a test) and worried that I might dump her like I did with the previous woman after I met her. What do you guys suggest I do? How do I make her calm down?

I was just telling the truth when she asked me if I am also sleeping with someone else. Now I am deeply regretting telling her.


Edit: People keep saying I was in a relationship or exclusive and was cheating. I had nothing official going on before and felt sour with the previous girl already on our last two dates.  The new girl who I had real connection with just made it clearer

When I say current girl was going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù it was just a expression. Trust me I have dealt with crazy and she is not like that.

Thank you everyone who has some brains and actually gave me some positive feedback this is highly appreciated. Big thanks to your help we are getting together tomorrow and fixing things:)

For the one‚Äôs who say I get what I deserve for sleeping around, you probably do not understand what dating is like in your 20s so it is better to not say anything if it‚Äôs negative‚Ä¶",ittask,204,1690375457.0,0.78,1517,298,1517

** ORIGINAL POST **



I need a little clarity on how I should be feeling and act in this situation. 

TL;DR: I fainted after losing a lot of blood during sex. The guy reacted weirdly and is ignoring me. What should I do?

I (21F) had been seeing this guy (24M) for a few weeks and I decided last night to be intimate with him, completely consensually. 

It was all great at that point and it was really fun; afterwards we cuddled and he did talk about the future/ seeing me again. 

However, in the morning when we had sex, we were a bit too rough and I think I tore something internally a little. I bled bright blood (not my period - this was different) everywhere and he was horrified. 

I apologised profusely and got up to clean myself up in the bathroom, but fainted, covered in blood, on his floor. 

We acted like it was really normal after - I stayed on the floor a while, got up, ate what I felt like I could (though I physically felt really sick and had ringing in my ears still) and I washed his ruined sheets for him. 

He looked so freaked the entire time, if not disgusted by the blood, and more or less refused to acknowledge it. 

He drove me home but said he ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt sure‚Äô if he wanted to see me again as he was now too busy. 

I fainted when I walked in my flat, and ended up having to go to the emergency room as I did not stop bleeding for a number of hours after. I lost about a pint of blood in all (it‚Äôs under investigation). 

The guy messaged to thank me for the night, and I replied saying the same and asking how he was, but he has not replied in hours and had left me on read. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken and so ashamed that I messed up his sheets, and that as a result of the episode it seems like he wants nothing to do with me now. 

I also think he acted really strangely about it, what do you think about this whole situation?",anonacc1754,208,1690647734.0,0.93,2762,539,2762
"He wants a bj on the first date and wants me to provide condoms for him is it even worth going? He wants a blowjob on the first date. I‚Äôm not sure if I want that . Then he wants me to provide condoms and every chance he can get he never goes to get any . Should I even do this ? He‚Äôs like can you stop and get some and then he wants a specific kind. Then why not get them yourself? He‚Äôs like I wanna show you off he‚Äôs 40 and I‚Äôm 21. He says he doesn‚Äôt look at age but is really proud to show me off to all his friends and people he plays golf with. He‚Äôs like he and his ex wife never used condoms but since I‚Äôm not on birth control I told him it was a must that we use them. He agreed because he said he didn‚Äôt want to make any babies right now. He wants the ones that are thin and feel like you‚Äôre wearing nothing their like almost 10 bucks at the store so you could at least buy them. He makes it seem like he wants to treat me good. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because he actually does or if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm young that he wants to show me off to his friends.

The thing is we‚Äôre finally meeting first time we were supposed to meet he wanted me to come over at 11pm. I set boundaries and told him I wouldn‚Äôt be coming over because coming to his house is extremely intimate. But a blowjob is even more intimate. He told me basically his wife cheated on him. They‚Äôve been divorced for 2 years . During the 2 years of them not being together he claims to haven‚Äôt had sex . Even if that is true I find it hard to believe with how high his sex drive seems to be. He‚Äôs told me he wants a relationship with me and he really likes me. He said he only wants to have sex with me. At first he said he‚Äôd buy them and we could leave a pack in his car just in case we have sex.  Then all of sudden he was on the road seeing his parents in his hometown and didn‚Äôt think to stop. Now it‚Äôs left up to me to get them. Which I told him I‚Äôd rather him get them because I‚Äôm not sure what kind he likes he sent me the ones he likes saying he wants it to feel like he‚Äôs wearing nothing because he doesn‚Äôt want to wear a condom at all.

"Girl I dated for almost a year wanted to take things slow, and now with her new guy within a few months she's engaged I'm feeling really confused, the girl I dated for almost year always took things slow. We only had sex for the first time and went exclusive after 3 months, we took our first vacation as a couple after 8 months, and she never wanted that we move in together in a flat that I offered to pay for (rent) 100%.

In general, she always gave me the feeling like she was a very busy and independent girl that prioritize her career over anything. So I thought it was the main reason.

But then we broke up, and within a month she was dating a new guy, within 2-3 months they moved in together, and just a few months later got engaged.

I have gone a couple of dates with this guy I'm seeing, and overall he seems nice we have some common interests but he seems to think a lot with his dick and is shitty at communication. Case in point, we were fooling around and he wanted to go further, I said ok as long as there was no penetration of any kind, he agreed and fun times were had.

He always buys me clothes and its obviously old people clothes and gets mad when i dont wear them. theres a lovely old woman called angelina (fake name) shes 72 and she really likes him hes been working there since he was 16 and her family never visits so hes grown quote close with her and he always brushes her hair and buys her loads of things and he took her hairbrush home and goes absolutely mental when i touch it and takes it everywhere with him and it‚Äôs absolutely berserk. when he gets home from work hell call her andd talk to her for hours then go on the bathroom for about  1-2 hours everyday after work and then never wants to have sex but hell have sex with me on the weekend when he doesnt work i dont want to assume things but I think he‚Äôs touching himself to her or thinking about her while doing it I‚Äôm not sure and I just feel like either something is going on with oth them. it was her birthday and he literally spent nearly all of his wage on birthday presents for her and when it was my birthday he barely spent ¬£50 which is fine but why would you spend almost 1500 on an old woman And it‚Äôs just strange like he has things to pay and he‚Äôs spending his whole months wage woman and not on necessities.

"""Goes to therapy"" is an absurd prerequisite for dating On dating apps, I come across a lot of people who write that they're only looking for matches with people who go to therapy. This is absurd to me.They're assuming that everyone is like them: that they were messed up and confused until they went to therapy, and now they're better. 

But some people aren't any more messed up without therapy than other people are with therapy. For some people, therapy (or at least whatever therapy they have access to) isn't helpful.

"Guy didn't look like his pictures. Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great. 

Seriously, if they don't look like their pictures, just run. If they've been deceptive before you've even met them, of course it's not going to go well! üòÇ",Difficult_Web404,302,1690807063.0,0.93,2260,447,2260
"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that? I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it.""

"Why do girls like a little belly on their man??? Not trying to brag here, but by many accounts I'm quite a fit, good-lookin' dude. However I'm not Olympic athlete level fit. I have a little bit of a belly and love-handles. I've always been a little self-conscious about it and I'm working on losing that last little bit of fat.

HOWEVER every girl I've ever been with, including my current gf, have all either indirectly or directly said they love my belly/love handles. They tell me I'm so hot even though I don't have those chizzled abs that models and famous actors do. Whenever I talk about wanting to lose weight and get rid of the belly/love handles they are always genuinely distressed and say things like ""nooo! I love your little belly!"" Or ""I don't want you to lose too much weight."" and etc.

I really want to understand this. How/why do girls find this attractive? What is it about a little bit of belly on a guy that girls find so attractive? And wouldn't any girl be happy to see their bf work on himself and get more and more fit? I have heard of the notion of the bf being super fit triggering self-confidence issues and such. I can understand that somewhat - Sometimes I look at my gf who is just so hot and it makes me wonder could someone so attractive really chose me? - But is there more to it?

Edit: This has been really informative and helpful. I think I might finally be able to feel more comfy in my own skin (or body as it were), finally being able to rest in the notion that there's more than one type of body that women find attractive.

I dont want to be pushy and ask again for sex so I eventually stop making out because I think its probably too soon for her.

Anyway we hang out for another hour or so on the couch just talking and getting to know each other better and cuddling a bit. Anyway she went home and now its been about 1 week and she hasnt responded to my messages.Was I too pushy for the sex? Did my eagerness turn her off?

Would this be a deal breaker or would you not give a darn?",cheesomacitis,424,1690204408.0,0.96,716,144,716
"I'm tired of being sexually unattractive Dating for the past few years have been pretty difficult for me. I'm always told that I'm nice to talk to or I'm sweet, but there's never any sexual attraction to me. The last woman I was dealing with was really enthusiastic about me at first, but then later down the line she eventually just admitted she's not sexually attracted to me. Its like I always have to ignore the fact that I have a sex drive because I know that I'm just not the kind of guy that woman would be intimate with for some reason. I'm not fat, I'm in good shape, I take my hygiene seriously, but for some reason I just don't have any sex appeal. 

After this last situation I'm not even sure if I want to continue dating anymore. I know there's more to relationships than sex, but it really does make me feel like crap to be told ""Hey you're cool, I just wouldn't ever think of touching you though."" basically. When I was younger, like in my early 20s ( I'm 32 now) I didn't really have this issue to this extent. I dealt with a few people who wanted to be intimate with me. After 25 though I don't know what happened. I just feel like a loser.",Beyond_TooWeird,443,1690296646.0,0.95,1158,223,1158
"Bf says he ""earned"" a bj and ""needs"" it, but doesn't respect my disgust towards it. **thanks for all the advice** I sat down with him and talked for hours, even continued the conversation to days. It really went amazing and he seemed understanding until he hit me with ""i liked you better when you were 17 and more open"". Immediately broke up with him and found out from his family he's seeing someone new already who is 17 which made them kick him out. I have no further update. I just know they haven't seen him since and i changed the locks on my home and blocked him.
---
My bf (23) and i (21) have been dating for 4 years. In those 4 years he's done ALOT for me and had to deal with my mental health issues. Everytime he did something (small like buy me candy or big like gift me earrings), he ALWAYS says ""i deserve head"" or ""i really earned head"". I came forward and explained my disgust towards giving head and he just hits me with ""it's clean. I haven't peed. I can shower."" or whatever.
Sometimes went so far and said ""but i give u head? how's that fair?"" which i told him, he does because he wants it. Not because i asked/begged for it. I'm at the point where i refuse to let him give me head because he's gonna ask for himself afterwards.
My opinion isn't gonna change on it. It's gross to me and what's worse is, that his ""thing"" smells really f-ing disgusting all the time+he's a cigarette smoker. Just imagine the bad diet.
This begging has turned me off so much that there's no sexual activities going on at all since a few months, which makes him even more aggressive and triggered. He mentioned once that if this isn't gonna change, he can't continue this relationship because he ""needs"" it in his life.
Sometimes he just shoves ""it"" in my face and like i mentioned, it stinks. Happened before in my sleep as well. I don't know what to do anymore. I gotta admit, i myself have no real interest in touching it. Yes, I'm 100% straight. Just no high sex drive and more of a cuddly person.
The relationship overall is amazing. I truly think he's my soulmate and apart from this issue, we match with everything. No serious fights, no disrespect...he cheated 3 times over his phone, but i forgave him, because it was pretty early into the relationship.
Since i can't talk about this with my family or friends, I'm asking strangers on Reddit for advice.",miiinxy,580,1690199633.0,0.78,2364,441,2364
"I dated a guy for a month and someone reached out to me saying she was his girlfriend. I have been talking with a guy for about a month now, and we just became official a few weeks ago. Unfortunately he lost his job, which was tied to his housing, so he had to move out and moved in with me for the time being. 

About a week and a half after, a random person reached out to me and said she was his girlfriend and they've been dating for 5 months. SHe said she's been out of town for work since he was fired, so he couldn't stay with her. She doesn't want to talk on the phone, and is so angry at him and just done with it. She said he told her I was just a friend who is letting him rent my second bedroom. She said he couldnt live with her anyways because he has a dog, and he place doesn't allow dogs. 

He says they are just friends and she's crazy now.

"First date was a disaster So I (29) went on a first date Friday night with a man (31) that I‚Äôve been talking to for a little over 2 months we‚Äôve never met because he lives 2hrs away and he had lagged on the 3 previous attempts to hang out‚Ä¶ it was always bs excuses (I‚Äôm sick, my eye is red, I‚Äôm scared to meet you because I‚Äôm not social) but somehow I was dumb enough to look pass it. He finally made plans to visit me on his day off and decided to book a room suggesting we have dinner and meet for breakfast the next morning‚Ä¶but red flags were starting to appear before he even got to my city for example when I asked for his eta so I can ‚Äúget ready‚Äù he replied with a snarky ‚Äúwhy would you need to get ready? I told you I always look like a bum. Don‚Äôt dress too nicely it‚Äôll just make me feel awkward.‚Äù I thought it was weird but I decided to just reassure him despite the uneasiness. So we make plans to meet up(refused to pick me up) at the restaurant of my choosing (he told me to choose) I told him where and he happily agreed.
I got to the restaurant maybe 5-8 minutes after him, greeted him warmly and I all got was a cold ‚Äúdid you see what I texted you? It‚Äôs a 40 minute wait.‚Äù So I said ‚Äúoh ok should we go walk?‚Äù Meanwhile he‚Äôs sulking and obviously annoyed he gets up ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù then I suggest we sit at an empty table so we could talk and he got even more visibly annoyed. We sit down and he tells me ‚Äúthis is annoying why would you pick this place knowing I don‚Äôt like crowds I feel like you did this maliciously and on purpose to take shots at me‚Äù I was in shock! I again tried to reassure him that I would never do such a thing and even asked him if he wanted to go somewhere else. He declined saying ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point I already put my name down‚Äù 
He gets the text stating our table was ready, so we get seated and while we‚Äôre looking at the menu I mention I might just get something small BUT HE EVEN GOT ANNOYED AT THAT. at this point getting up and walking out was running through my head. He ordered hot sake shots, took the first one without me lol. told me to taste his cocktail I took 2 sips and he said ‚Äúmight as well keep it since you‚Äôre drinking it all.‚Äù Ffw to the end of the night‚Ä¶. He pays the bill and we walk outside. He offers to walk me to my car, half way there I stop him and we exchange a few words gave him a side hug and dipped . When I got home I texted ‚Äúthanks for dinner‚Äù he instantly responded ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome. I‚Äôm sorry for taking your time.‚Äù GUYS WTF

"First date was a disaster So I (29) went on a first date Friday night with a man (31) that I‚Äôve been talking to for a little over 2 months. We met through mutuals, he added me on IG and it kinda just went from there. There was no actual intent on dating the first month of chatting‚Äîthere was friendship and it naturally grew into more. We texted everyday and FT. We didn‚Äôt meet up as quickly because he lives 2hrs away and he had lagged on the 3 previous attempts to hang out‚Ä¶ (yes I know how that looks) it was always bs excuses (I‚Äôm sick, my eye is red, I‚Äôm scared to meet you because I‚Äôm not social) but somehow I was dumb enough to look past it. I knew he was extremely shy. 

He finally made plans to visit me on his day off and decided to book a room suggesting we have dinner and meet for breakfast the next morning‚Ä¶but red flags were starting to appear before he even got to my city for example when I asked for his eta so I can ‚Äúget ready‚Äù he replied with a snarky ‚Äúwhy would you need to get ready? I told you I always look like a bum. Don‚Äôt dress too nicely it‚Äôll just make me feel awkward.‚Äù I thought it was weird but I decided to reassure him (like I always had to do) despite the uneasiness knowing he had self esteem issues due the constant self deprecating remarks he made about himself to me.

So he makes it to the hotel, tells me he doesn‚Äôt want to pick me up because he‚Äôs driving an old car and that he needed to ‚Äúreset before meeting me.‚Äù So I was like sure that‚Äôs fine. I thought maybe he just wanted to lay down for a bit or something.

He tells me when to head out. I got to the restaurant approximately 5-8 minutes after him, greeted him warmly and I all got was a cold ‚Äúdid you see what I texted you? It‚Äôs a 40 minute wait.‚Äù I said ‚Äúoh ok should we go walk?‚Äù (We were in a market place setting) Meanwhile he‚Äôs sulking and obviously annoyed he gets up ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù then I suggest we sit at an empty table so we could comfortably talk and he got even more irritated. We sit down, he tells me ‚Äúthis is annoying why would you pick this place knowing I don‚Äôt like crowds I feel like you did this maliciously and on purpose to take shots at me‚Äù he told me in a previous conversation that he doesn‚Äôt like crowds but in no way did I think to this extent‚Ä¶ I was in shock! I again tried to reassure him that I would never do such a thing, even asking him if he wanted to go somewhere else. He declined ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point I already put my name down‚Äù 

He gets the ‚Äútable is ready‚Äù text so we get seated and while we‚Äôre looking at the menu I mention I might just get something small BUT HE EVEN GOT ANNOYED AT THAT. ‚ÄúWhy would you pick this place knowing you were just going to get an appetizer. It‚Äôs awkward that I‚Äôm going to be eating and you‚Äôre not.‚Äù Uhhh??? at this point getting up and walking out was running through my head. He ordered hot sake shots, took the first one without me lol. Told me to taste his cocktail so I took 2 sips and he said ‚Äúmight as well keep it, since you‚Äôre drinking it all.‚Äù 

Fast forward to the end of the night‚Ä¶. He pays the bill and we walk outside. He offers to walk me to my car &amp; asks me ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd you park at?‚Äù  I tell him I parked behind the theater. He replies ‚Äúlike I know where the hell that‚Äôs at‚Äù 
Not even half way there I stop him and we exchange a few words gave him a side hug and dipped. When I got home I texted ‚Äúthanks for dinner‚Äù he instantly responded ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome.

"Just deleted all dating apps I'm not giving up on dating, I'm just sick of the toxic culture that online dating seems to perpetuate between all sexes and genders. It makes me sick to see how we date now, I was getting matches and nothing of substance was ever talked about, on top of that you have fake accounts that constantly hit me (I'm male) to buy nudes, to get on only fans, to add an insta account, or some sugar daddy bullshit that just makes me physically gag.

Then when you do match with someone legit, it's like talking to a brick wall. For fucks sake I've had better conversations with bots. I'm not saying these people aren't wonderful people looking for something good in their lives but the online dating scene is a sick puppy and doesn't really condone good conversation or getting to know each other. It's a meat grinder for both parties for different reasons.

Almost all my relationships have been found actually talking to someone, not texting or looking at a profile that doesn't allow barely any sort of information regarding the person. Instead it's quick one liners and tags. None of which really builds up to anything remotely needed to decide if I like the person or not.

It's toxic as fuck, and I'm over it. I'd rather wait it out and find someone I mesh well with doing something worth my time and not being detrimental to my opinion of other human beings.",The_Fluffness,1218,1665118491.0,0.96,1386,250,1386
"A Girl called me fat phobic for rejecting her Yesterday, after I got off work I hit the gym like I usually do. I was basically done for the day, all I had left to do was to hit the leg press machine. While I was in the middle of my workout this girl walked over and started up a conversation with me. This girl was about 5‚Äù5 and 195 or 200 lbs She eventually asked if she could get my number or instagram. I told her that I wasn‚Äôt down for that and in the most gentle way I could I said no.

She then asked why I said no, but I didn‚Äôt want to give her my real reason so I said that I just wasn‚Äôt interested in giving out my number or social. After that she got pretty aggressive and said that wasn‚Äôt a real  answer and continued asking why. I was going to get up and just leave but she got really rude. I eventually told her that it was because she was really overweight and I couldn‚Äôt date a girl like that . She then said I was  shaming her and that i was basically being fat phobic. She cursed me out and left, but I‚Äôve been thinking was  I rude about the situation ?",Jesh__4,1420,1690441727.0,0.92,1070,220,1070
