"I've seen many youtube cooks use microplanes. Are they really that much better than regular graters? Specifically wondering about this for grating (frozen) ginger, garlic, and cheese. Right now I am eying the microplane rasp premium, but we do already have a regular grater at home and I don't cook that often. When I do, though, the recipes often include ginger and garlic. Grating works fine, but it seems as if the youtube cooks grate the ginger especially in no time, and for me it takes quite some minutes (cause its frozen and I keep adjusting my grip to not freeze my fingers off, and then sometimes its not quite the right angle so barely anything gets grated off).

My dad isn't really educated on it either. Only up size is that it costs the same as all the other beef there. 

Now I'm stuck. My family(including myself) is averse to any meat that's not medium well to well done. The color and texture puts us off. I think it's an immigrant thing.

"Finding culinary birch oil I'm trying to make semi-historically accurate US sarsaparilla, which historically used something called ""birch oil"" (to clarify: not I'm not interested in birch *syrup*).  However, I'm having a very hard time finding birch oil that is meant to be ingested: I see a lot of essential oils that are ""birch oil"", but from what I understand, essentially oils are not meant to be ingested and have no guarantees of being food-safe.

The only place I could find birch oil that is clearly meant to be consumed is [from a large scale manufacturer](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/Food/Detail/16153/433410/Birch-Oil--Sweet) that I imagine wouldn't fill super tiny orders. 

**My question is this: does anyone know where I can get birch oil that is safe to consume?**  I know that birch oil contains some methyl salicylate, and am not bothered by that. If there are certain essential oil forms of birch oil that are safe to ingest (ie diluted with carbonated water to the point where it doesn't taste bad), I'm also fine with that.

"Cooking fresh-frozen-tawed chicken vs frozen-tawed chicken Hey!

So I’ve been cooking chicken for as long as I can remember by just cutting a breast in half and putting both pieces on a preheated frying pan with around 3 swishes of olive oil. Usually, I bought fresh chicken and froze it at home, but last week I bought frozen chicken for the first time and I thawed them the same way, on the microwave. 

Now, with fresh-frozen-thawed chicken, I can get it browned and crusty on the outside consistently and juicy on the inside. For some reason tho, I can’t seem to get the frozen-thawed chicken to cook like the one I used to buy. It gets delicious, but sort of burned on the outside and more juicy on the inside, but no crust is formed.

Why would chicken cook differently like this? Is the second chicken supposed to cook on a lower heat setup? If so, why would chicken cook differently if both are frozen, the only difference being I bought one fresh?

"Are there guidelines I should follow at the grocery store when buying alliums (garlic, onions, etc) to avoid specimens that are already sprouting? Hi All, 

I've tried googling this and so far I haven't found any tips that actually seem to work. 

Yesterday I went to my closest grocery store (Albertsons/Safeway) and bought a head of garlic. It was intact, not a ton of loose paper on it, firm, white (no purple or discoloration), over all it looked like a good normal bulb of garlic. 

The recipe I was using it in called for the whole bulb to be split along the equator to and then tossed into some stock. I cut the bulb in half and sure enough like have the cloves had the little green dot indicating it was about to sprout. 

Now, I don't really care (I've heard the sprouts can be bitter but haven't personally noticed it that much) but I'd also like to be able to buy/store garlic for a little while (I don't go through a full head per week)  without having it sprout. 

Are there any tips you can suggest when buying garlic to try and get a head that isn't already about to sprout? Any tips on storing it (I know a cool dark spot is recommended but especially in the summer my house rarely drops below 72 degrees and we don't really have a ""cool"" spot I can put it in a cupboard low to the ground but that's probably the best I can do).

"Question regarding Wagyu tallow and making my own ground beef burgers. So, to start, I know that in America, Wagyu isn't a protected term, and it could refer to any number of crossbred cattle with some percentage of Wagyu lineage. I know that the ""Real deal"" comes from Japan only (though Australia has a decent grading system in place, too).


That said - I know that getting wagyu *tallow* is somewhat easier to do. I have also heard that Wagyu fat has some unique properties (such as a lower melting point and a unique flavor). I *also* know that fat is where most of the beefy flavor we perceive comes from - this is why Filet Mignon is often less beefy than, say, a strip steak.


So that all said - would it be possible to make faux wagyu burgers by buying and freezing some wagyu tallow, mincing it into a pebbly consistency, and then finally mixing that into some 99% lean american ground beef? 

Obviously it's possible in the sense that I could literally do it, but would the resulting burger have the beefy wagyu flavor without having to literally get real ground wagyu? Or is there something more at play preventing this strategy from working?

I ask because it seems like an obvious way to make some real banger burgers, but the fact that it isn't being done regularly already makes me think there's some reason it wouldn't work - I just can't for the life of me think of why.",BeyondElectricDreams,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/15bc0li/question_regarding_wagyu_tallow_and_making_my_own/,1690488533.0,0.57

"Flooded with cucumbers and need ideas I just really overdid the cucumber plants this year. Have a lot of Boston pickling cucumbers and Korean long cucumbers. Hoping for ideas for some preservation of them, but I’m already packed with some things.  Here’s what I’ve made

1. A few gallons of fermented kosher style pickles. Dill, garlic, coriander. Fridge is full for the year. 

2. Bread and butter pickles. Love these.  I make them a little less sweet than normal and with hot pepper. Everything spicy. 

3.  Freezer pickles. Paper thin sliced and in a sugar dill vinegar syrup put in the freezer. Sounds weird, but it’s pickled candy and delicious. 

4. Sweet relish. Traditional hot dog stuff. Cans easily. 

I also tried lime pickles - using pickling lime, not the citrus. Was curious what it did to texture. Really crispy but in a bad way. Didn’t like them texture wise. 

I make Korean kimchi cucumbers often. Vinegar, soy, garlic, gochugaru.  

Koji cucumber pickles were interesting.

Chinese smashed cucumbers were good. Had Szechuan peppercorn and soy sauce. Smashing is now my approach to the long cucumbers because I like the irregular pieces and texture. 

Did summer salads (cucumber, tomato, onion) and sour cream cucumbers. Not my favorites, but OK. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any other ideas. Preferably something I can can or store in the fridge for a while.",PlutoniumNiborg,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/15akrw8/flooded_with_cucumbers_and_need_ideas/,1690412603.0,0.87
"Tahdig/Dutch oven durability question Evening everyone,

I have a tahdig recipe I love but it has me put the dutch oven directly from the stovetop into 1 inch of cold water in my sink. The step is ""so the tahdig will release more easily."" I'm worried for my dutch oven's durability because of the rapid temperature change.

It's a Lodge enamel-covered cast iron dutch oven, had it about 10 years. It's green.

Because the step isn't for the quality of the recipe, just the ease of release of the tahdig, which I am fine with being in pieces, should I skip that step? Or can my dutch oven take the punishment once a week?

"Substitute for paneer cheese? I want to start trying to make Indian food at home, specifically Saag Paneer, but I live in a small Latin American country and I can't find paneer cheese for the life of me! We have loads of Indian &amp; Asian ingredients and spices available, but no paneer. There are a bunch of Indian restaurants here too so unless they're substituting for another cheese, they've got to be getting it somewhere?

What we do have is abundant queso panela, which I absolutely love grilled or fried, and it's on basically every list I've found of paneer substitutes. I'm skeptical of those lists though, because feta and ricotta are also frequently named and, while obviously delicious, those cheeses are just not even in the same hemisphere as paneer as far as flavor profiles. 

So in asking anyone who might have tried it, is panela actually a good substitute or do I need to buy a cow and make my own?

ETA: To everyone saying to make my own, and that the Indian restaurants around here are probably making their own, I think you may be right! I've just confirmed with the owner of one of the better known Indian spots close to me that they do in fact make their own.

"How to Create the Perfect Spanish Potato Tortilla Hey everyone

I've been on a quest to master the art of making an authentic Spanish Potato Tortilla (Tortilla Española) 

I've tried a few recipes, but I'm looking to take my potato tortilla to the next level. Does anyone have some pro tips and secrets to achieving the best flavor and texture?  
  
Here's what I have so far:  
  
Ingredients:  
  
Potatoes (Yukon Gold works great, right?)  
Eggs (should I go for 4 or 5?)  
Onion (Red or Yellow?)  
Olive Oil (Is extra-virgin necessary?)  
Salt &amp; Pepper (Any other seasoning recommendations?)

  
Cooking Method:  
  
Slicing vs. Dicing the potatoes?  
Pre-frying the potatoes before adding to the eggs?  
How do I get that perfectly creamy center without overcooking?  
I'd also love to know your thoughts on additional ingredients like garlic, cheese, or even chorizo. Are they welcome in a traditional Spanish Potato Tortilla?  
  
Any tips on flipping the tortilla without making a mess would be GREATLY appreciated!

"Why does this ganache recipe keep separating on me? I make this for a bon bon filling, and I would say half the time it splits on me. 

60ml Absinthe,
220g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids or higher),
15g unsalted butter,
120ml heavy cream,
pinch of sea salt

So, I put the chocolate, butter, and salt in a bowl, pour over the hot cream, let it sit a minute, mix with a small whisk until smooth, then I add in the absinthe little by little.

I've noticed this recipe calls for a lot of chocolate compared to a lot of my other ganaches and I have trouble getting it melted down fully. Many times I need to put it back on some heat to get the callets fully melted. The absinthe addition seems to give me the most problems though. Every ganache recipe I've done with an alcohol component I add that in after the fact, and this is the only one that ever separates. The others I use often have more ingredients and use white or milk chocolate. Do I need to add the absinthe slower? Or am I giving up too soon on my mixing?

However, my fiancee got called into work this evening, so I was wondering if it will be ok to let the seasoned chicken sit another day in the fridge, and we could roast it for dinner tomorrow night instead (48hrs of seasoning)? Should I cover it up? Go ahead and roast it tonight already?

Placed on a bed of veggies in the roasting pan, oven at 400. Here is the 'before' picture: https://imgur.com/a/GSlKmPo

"Herb compound butter technique question I am making an herb compound butter from scratch, i.e. churning cream into butter using a food processor. I've made it the conventional way, just mixing in finely minced herbs at the end, which works but you get small pieces of herbs throughout which alters the mouthfeel. I have a vision in my head of fully incorporating the herbs into the butter, so that it is entirely smooth with the flavor/color of herbs but without the noticeable herb pieces - or at least getting them as small as possible.

Are there any recommendations for achieving this? I could try adding the herbs to the cream in the very beginning, to give them more time to puree in the processor. Alternatively I thought about creating an herb puree in a high-powered Vitamix and then incorporating this into the butter, but I would need to add water or oil to make the puree smooth and this would of course affect the composition of the butter when incorporated - maybe for the worse(?).

"Lemon Raspberry Tart--What went wrong with this crust? This is the [recipe I used.](https://zestfulkitchen.com/wprm_print/33107)

Fillings came out well, but the crust is not structurally sound. It cracked while initial backing a little bit, and after baking with the curd and letting set in the fridge, it essentially fell apart while cutting and won't fully release from the bottom of the tart pan. Tastes okay, like a super crumbly sugar cookie. 

Places where it might have gone wrong:

1. I (very lightly) greased the tart pan even though it didn't say to. 
2. It says the crust can be made up to 4 days ahead, so I made it the day before. It was fully hard out of the fridge so it was at least half an hour softening before I rolled it. While rolling it was coming a part a bit so I had to pinch together and reroll in a few places.
3. After forming in the pan, it was in the freezer for more than the prescribed 30 minutes, but not more than an hour.
4. During baking, it seemed like it needed more time so I probably added 10-15 minutes to baking time. The edges were getting golden, but the center was very blonde. When done baking, the center was set and firm, but still blondish-white.

The butter was definitely chilled when it went in to the batter. The initial putting together of the batter seemed to work perfectly. ",37Thrash42,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/159qp7h/lemon_raspberry_tartwhat_went_wrong_with_this/,1690332333.0,0.67

"Alternate way to incorporate pineapple into this al pastor recipe [I'm working with this tacos al pastor recipe by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/tacos-al-pastor-recipe)

Made this recipe once before without pineapple and it was great aside from missing the sweetness of the pineapple. The reason it was left out is my wife and I both don't like the texture of large chunks of fruit, so I'm looking for a different way to incorporate it.

My initial thought was to add pineapple juice to the marinade however I'm concerned the enzymes might break down the meat too much during it's rest in the fridge.

I also am considering adding diced pineapple to the loaf as this would mimic how my favourite taco place serves theirs, but once again, I worry about the enzyme.

My other two thoughts are making a reduction of straight pineapple juice to drizzle on the meat while on the griddle or just simply adding diced pineapple to griddle while cooking.

"spatchcock chicken temp and time I have been making a lot of spatchcock chicken recently at 375 for approx 1 hr and 10 min. 

I have read other recipes that say it’s better to cook at a higher temperature (425-475) and shorter time.

Assuming I pull the chicken when the internal temperature is the same, I am wondering how altering the cooking temp/time impacts the chicken. It makes sense to me that higher temp means crispier skin but what does increasing temp and decreasing time do to the juiciness of the breast meat? eg 375 for 1 hr and 10 min vs 425 for 45 min w an internal temp of 155/160.

"Microwave vs parboil mushrooms before sauté revisited This question has been asked before but no one seemed to have tried it. Many suspected that it will change the texture of the mushrooms, and many suggested that it will take a very long time (e.g. 10 min in microwave) if you want to achieve the same result as parboil.

I have tried it with some lions mane in the microwave for 44 - 66 sec before sautéing and it seemed fine, but idk if it is just a one off, or if the lions mane, having a different structure than most other mushrooms, works differently to other mushrooms.

So has anyone else tried it? How did it go? I have the following concerns:

\- The theory being that microwave is a more energy efficient way to heat up food due to less heat loss, and also the fact that it superheats certain parts that contains water and organic compound, it will collapse the cell walls more quickly and directly, but it might also remove the buffering effect of evaporating water that can't go pass the boiling point at 1ATM, so that the mushroom might go higher than 100C/212F and evanescent compounds might breakdown more in the microwave.

\- The concern of parboiling that, since you have to make ""mushroom broth"" before cooking the water off completely, you either 1.) leave some of the broth in before you add the oil in the saute process, so that you do lose the fond, but you are adding oil to aqueous broth, so it just splatters and still won't saute, or 2.) dry all the moisture in the pan, lose the fond altogether, or otherwise have to deliberately make a pan sauce out of the fond after cooking by removing the mushroom and oil, add water/wine and butter and scrape the bottom, which seems counter productive.

Has anyone tried either way?",ianng555,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/159c1hp/microwave_vs_parboil_mushrooms_before_sauté/,1690299657.0,0.25

"When to use onion in pasta sauces? I've been following some different pasta sauce recipes to try and improve my pasta game beyond huge batches of bolognese. I'm really enjoying the pan sauce framework idea that Ethan Chlebowski did a video on. Brown your meat in fat, cook your aromatics in the remaining fat, deglaze with liquid (eg. tomatoes, alcohol, stock). For pasta dishes, at this point I reduce as neccesary and stir in al dente pasta before serving.

I've always been the type to put onion in almost everything but I'm struggling to understand when not to use it.

My usual method is to pour the hot liquid over raw, thinly sliced veggies.

"Sushi rice troubleshooting Hello! I recently bought a 15-pound sack of short grain rice for sushi and onigiri, but I've been having some trouble getting it just right. It tends to be a little too mushy and also sticks to the bottom of my rice cooker. I've had my rice cooker for years and use it several times a week, and I've never had this trouble with any other types of rice. Does anyone have any tips?

Some info on how I'm making the rice:

- I rinse it until clear
- I soak it for at least 15 minutes
- I use a rice cooker
- I plop the cooked rice onto a shallow pan and gently fold in my sushi vinegar and/or seasonings while it's still steaming hot

Here are my general questions:

- Should I try using less water in my rice cooker? (I've been using the same rice:water proportions as with other types of rice in this same cooker.)
- Is it normal to have a layer of short grain/sushi rice stick to the bottom of your rice cooker?
- Should I be able to discern individual rice grains once cooked? (As it is, they tend to mush together.)

"Best substitute for apple juice in a soup? I'm looking to tweak a recipe, and wanted some advice on what to use in place of apple juice. In this recipe:

2 cups water  
2 cups apple juice  
1 tsp dried oregano  
1 6oz can tomato paste (or 2 Tbsp)  
1 tsp ground cumin  
1 tsp cayenne (or to taste)  
1 large onion, diced (yellow or vidalia)  
2 4oz cans chilis  
3 15oz cans black beans, drained and rinsed  
1 medium red bell pepper, diced  
fresh cilantro  
shredded cheddar cheese

Heat a splash of olive oil in a large pot on medium-high heat.  
Cook onion and chilies until onion is softened and the chilies' liquid is absorbed.  
Add water, apple juice, oregano, tomato paste, cumin, and cayenne. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes.  
Stir in beans and bell pepper. Cover and simmer 15 minutes.  
Serve, and garnish with cilantro and cheddar.

&amp;#x200B;

I find the recipe a little too sweet, with a slight syrupy quality. Trying to google the issue got recommendations of other fruit juices, which wouldn't solve my problem, or white wine, which I worry might be too dry.

"Icecream: Why do you need to make a custard base and not just stir egg yolks in? So, I’ve been a bit on an ice cream adventure and I’ve finally tried to dive deep into different ingredients and such.
And I’m really confused about the heating of the mixture.

Let’s say the ingredients are.
Milk 
Cream 
Sugar
Egg

I’ve been told that you heat it, both to make a custard, melt excess sugar and to remove some of the water from it.

I’ve also seen some other recipes where they only use cream instead.
But some of them stir the cream in a bowl*. Stir sugar their eggs yolks in another and then fold them together.
Whereas others heat it, just with the cream instead of milk of course.
But I can’t figure out the difference, other than it may be thicker?

My own recipe’s base is 
Cream
Eggs
Condensized milk

But I’ve been trying around with it a bit and thought about making it more thin with milk. Which is why I’ve thought of making a low sugar custard base and then add the cream and condensized milk.
But I don’t have enough money this month to test it. 
Which is one reason why I thought it was a good idea to make my own post.
The other is I stooped upon a 10 year old post in here with my question, but it didn’t answer exactly what I wanted to know.
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1h13we/i_made_ice_cream_why_do_you_need_to_cookheat_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1

So my questions are:
1. What’s the difference between deciding to heat the egg yolks to make custard and just blending them in?

2. If you only do it with cream. Can you just skip making a custard(still with eggs in the base) and still have mostly the same taste?

3. Anyone have some specific icecream recipes they love? =).                         (Not sure if this is against the rules. I’ll remove it, if it is)

Some people make a custard base to their icecream and some people don’t, yet still have egg yolks in.

I'm vegetarian, so I bought papain powder (another enzyme) instead and am working with that.

"Boil the milk before making a crème anglaise for an ice cream? Lauroose vs The Perfect Scoop I've been researching ice cream recipes, but I received two contradictory opinions. The first recipe is the vanilla ice cream recipe from ""The Perfect Scoop"" by David Lebovitz. 

It states, ""Warm the milk, sugar, 1 cup (250ml) of the cream blablabla..."" But on the other hand, Larousse Gastronomie suggests, ""Boil 500 ml (17 fl oz, 2 cups) of milk flavored with vanilla blablabla....""  
  
Note: I understand that these are entirely different recipes, and Larousse's recipe is the only one that actually makes a crème anglaise, while ""The Perfect Scoop"" claims to always use a crème anglaise for its ice cream recipes, but not in this particular case, at least not in a normal way..  
  
The confusing part is why Lauroose boils the milk beforehand while ""The Perfect Scoop"" instructs to cover and steep the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes, without boiling. 

 I'm curious if these two methods are meant to achieve similar results.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Perfect Scoop**

Warm the milk, sugar, 1 cup (250ml) of the cream, and the salt in a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the warm milk and add the bean as well. Cover, remove from the heat, and let steep at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
Pour the remaining 1 cup (250ml) cream into a large bowl and set a mesh strainer on top. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed egg yolks into the saucepan. Stir the mixture constantly with a heatproof spatula over medium heat, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula.

&amp;#x200B;

**Larousse** 

vanilla ice cream

Prepare a crème anglaise with 100 ml (4 fl oz, 7 tablespoons) milk and a vanilla pod (bean) cut in two, 5 or 6 egg yolks, 150 g (5 oz, ⅔ cup) caster (superfine) sugar and 400 ml (14 fl oz, 1¾ cups) double (heavy) cream.

**Larousse** 

crème anglaise

Blend 250 g (9 oz, 1 cup) caster (superfine) sugar, a pinch of salt and 8 egg yolks in a saucepan using a whisk. Boil 500 ml (17 fl oz, 2 cups) milk flavoured with vanilla or the zest of either a lemon or an orange. When the sugar-egg yolk mixture forms ribbons, gradually add the warm (not boiling) milk.

"""Once open, use within X days""? So I've noticed a lot of brined products like olives or sun-dried tomatoes -- and even some lacto-fermented products like ""raw"" Sauerkraut from the chilled section of the supermarket -- will be dated months or even a year+ out, but will stipulate you consume them within a few days of opening. 

But my understanding is that lacto-ferments and brined/pickled foods don't just go ""off"" once you unseal the lid. The kitchen I work at orders in those big commercial sized tubs of brined olives, and they seem to last basically indefinitely. As do capers and pickled cucumbers and whatnot. I guess lacto-ferments like Sauerkraut, Kimchi etc probably start to degrade after weeks or months rather than years like certain jarred/canned goods. But why is it that, say, the olives buy from the supermarket insist on using within days of opening, yet the olives at work come with no such stipulation?

Is the ""use within x days of opening"" just some legalese on the manufacturer's end so they have plausible deniability if, say, someone opens a jar of Kimchi and then just leaves it behind a radiator for weeks and then gets sick from it? Or is there some actual food chemistry related reason to always consume such products within the time frame provided? I just find I end up with a lot of food waste, because I might have a hankering for olives or kimchi or pickled gherkins in one meal, but then not want to use up the rest for some weeks, at which point they end up in the bin because the label said to use within 3 days.",tom_oakley,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/155nrph/once_open_use_within_x_days/,1689945369.0,0.99

"Is there a sort of rule of thumb to calculate the actual, usable capacity of a pot? Hi everyone!

I was checking out some pots and I got a bit of a question, although it might be a stupid one.

When buying a pot, you see the size of the pot in a volumetric capacity (Liters or Quarts). But what I don't know is if those said volumes are the capacity if it would be completely filled up to the rim, or if it's an actually usable volume.

If that were the case, say I need a pot where I can cook 3,8 litres of liquid (or 4 quarts), then a 3,8L pot would be too small. So is there any sort of ""standard"" rule of thumb that I can use to estimate the max amount of liquid that I can cook in a top, or which size of a top do I need to cook a certain amount of liquid?

"Using wild ducks in duck bolognese Hi, cooks. I was gifted five wild ducks by a friend who hunts. I've been given some before, and they are small and definitely gamey, more so than the farmed ones in restaurants. I also found them hard to butcher last time and my final dish was a mess.

So with this batch, I thought I'd do bolognese. However, I'm not sure if an all-wild-duck sauce would be too much, and if so, what would I cut it with to make it more appealing. In most good traditional recipes, it is made with a combination of meats (beef, pork, veal). And any recipe for duck bolognese is probably for commercially-raised ducks and not what I have, and I sort of don't want to screw this up.

I have a meat grinder attachment for my KA so that's taken care of. I have access to any ingredients I want. Ground veal can be hard to come by, but not impossible.

"Pectin Substitution Issue Hello,

I was following [this](https://lilluna.com/jalapeno-jelly/) recipe for some Jalapeno Jelly and subbed powdered pectin in place of the liquid called for in the recipe as that was what I had on hand.

"Can you ferment yogurt in multiple stages? I've been toying with making my own yogurt recently, and I've figured out that leaving the jar in the hot Texas summer sun keeps it at an optimal 110°F from ~12-8 or so. But I've been struggling with how to finish off the rest of the 24 hours. The 'leaving the light on in the oven' trick didn't work. I tried nestling it in an open slow cooker which got too hot. Nothing has come close to the consistency and ease of the afternoon sun.

My research has taught me that when the milk gets too hot the bacteria dies, and when it gets too cold it goes dormant. Dormant doesn't sound too bad. Death is final, but you can wake up from dormant, right?

So I'm thinking, would it be feasible to let the yogurt go cold over night and then set it back out when the sun's back out doing it's thing? Will the bacteria perk up and go back to work? Or even if so, are there other concerns to doing this? Would it be best to just leave it outside (night temps in the 80s), or refrigerate over night? If I remember correctly, I think the yogurt dropped down into the 90s using the oven light, but maybe that's preferable to 80s or fridge? 

If somebody has other tricks to try for holding the yogurt at an optimal temp, I'd love to hear those too.

"Substitute for Venison Stock? So I stumbled onto some Venison Medallions a couple weeks ago (frozen, in one of those plastic-ish trays, so not saying it's ""fresh off the hoof"" or gourmet), and was poking around the bookshelf and my finger fell onto my copy of *Hunter, Gather, Cook* and the Venison w Morels and Garlic and Horseradish-Beet Puree recipe. Recipe calls for Venison Stock, and I recall that More Than Gourmet makes it, and of course, Amazon is 86'ed on that at the moment!

Not a crisis, but I figure this is a good foodie question: what direction is best here?

I am presuming that any poultry or seafood stocks are out the window, but maybe a Mushroom Stock? 

&amp;#x200B;

My mind meld sans insight:

\-Veal jumps in first as rich enough, but with a certain....subtlety that beef lacks so as to ensure the Venison shines

\-Beef obviously has the edge in *strength* of flavor over veal, but I also wonder if it will subsume the subtler notes of Venison so as to make it one of those ""great dish, but no idea it was venison until you told me"" dishes

\-Duck perhaps? Checks the ""gamey-ish"" box, rich and strong *enough*, but not overpowering (or maybe brash?) like the Beef might be in my thinking

\-Mushroom stock as a dark horse? Seems like the flavor profile is a natural fit, but no idea about other aspects

"Trying to make queso with homemade sodium citrate, feel like I'm losing my mind in the process. So I'm using a recipe I got from Adam Ragusea as a jumping off point. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but his recipe calls for around 1/3rd of a cup of lime juice for the citric acid, and half a teaspoon of baking soda for the sodium. Combine, stir until the foaming stops, supposedly you have sodium citrate at that point, or at least a close approximation of it. 80ml of evaporated milk, which is like 1/3rd of a 12oz can, and 200 grams of cheese, he used Monterey Jack, so I did too. Because I didn't want most of a can of evaporated milk sitting around the house, I tripled the recipe, but it just isn't holding, even if I do a smaller batch.

It seems fine at first, but no matter how long I wait for the cheese to melt (he puts his in all at once, so I did too, but I also tried doing handfuls at a time), and no matter how low I have my heat on my stove, as soon as I stir in the spices, fat gushes up onto the surface and around the sides, and the sauce is grainy. It seems like the cheese isn't melting all the way, to be honest, because I notice these little sand sized granules of cheese on my spoon as I'm stirring. I'm just completely lost here. He used fresh squeezed lime juice, and I'm using store bought, pre-bottled stuff. My baking soda is also a few months old, so I dunno if maybe that could be it?

I’m looking to recreate it but there doesn’t seem to be much info in regards to people making fried chicken with wet batters. 

Okay so from what I’ve looked at I’m the video they season heavily with cayenne and other stuff and then pour a pancake like batter. As far as similar recipes it seems to be like a Korean fried chicken and British fish and chips style. I’m more looking at the batter to get that crust like Willy Mae’s. So I’ve added all the ingredients I think would be in it. The only thing is I don’t know know the science behind it all. 

1. Corn Starch - lots of recipes I’ve seen have used a type of starch to get it crispy I reckon Willy maes uses either a starch or rice flour. Corn starch is also used by Kenji in his Korean fried chicken recipe 
2. Rice Flour- I’ve seen rice flour mentioned in a couple recipes but not as much as starches. In a reddit thread I saw someone mention that Willy Maes uses rice flour. Rice flour is also used in Hestons fish and chips recipe. 
3. AP Flour or 50/50 Blend using above. Hestons fish and chips recipe uses a 50/50 blend of AP flour and rice flour. 

NOW. What do you guys think would be the best thing to use here?

Other ingredients…..
4. Baking Powder. Used by Kenji in in his Korean fried chicken recipe 
5. Eggs - Have no idea if there’s eggs or not in the batter 
6. Water/Vodka. I get why Heston would use it in fish and chips and his restaurant but I don’t see a fried chicken joint using that much vodka. Another thing is that a similar place in LA. Honey Pots fried chicken uses water. So it’s def something in the flour.

"Advice on substituting chicken thighs with tofu in chicken tikka masala I want my tofu to have a distinct fatty flavor that contrasts somewhat with the curry. While I plan to freeze the tofu, unfreeze, squeeze out all of the water, and then marinade with fat and flavoring, but I want to basically seal up the tofu so that it doesn't absorb *too* much of the curry when inserted in. The last time I made curry with tofu, the tofu just seemed to soak up most of the curry and that ended up tasting weird as there was so little curry for my rice and there wasn't the mild contrast you would like. 

How should I try to seal up the tofu? Is covering the pieces with bread crumbs the only viable solution or is there a way without bread crumbs (as they seem like they would get very soggy in the curry and that could be weird)?

"Ways to elevate the seafood flavor in the portuguese seafood rice? Hi hi! First time poster here so I hope I'm using the flair right / posting right. 
So I recently went to a Portuguese restaurant and one of the course was a seafood rice dish with very intense seafood flavor. I fell in love with that dish immediately and have been trying to replicate at home. 

(also sorry if seafood flavor is too vague, I'm not entirely sure how to describe it but it's definitely super umami and stroke a balance with the tomato base)

I followed this recipe: https://fedbysab.com/seafood-rice/

My first attempt came out alright, delicious for sure, but I can't really taste the seafood flavor. Then for the second time, I tried to make some shrimp-infused oil and used that oil as the base. Still, it came out great, but not so much seafood flavor in the rice. The rice tastes mostly like tomato for sure.

My hypothesis is that the seafood I used might matter. I just got the frozen seafood medley from whole foods so it's probably not the best candidate to add flavor. However, I wonder if there are other tips or ways to add seafood flavor other than breaking the bank buying all the fresh seafood.

"Slicer / Dicer / gadget to cut vegetables into small cubes I am currently following a modified paleo diet focused on incorporating a variety of vegetables into every meal, comprising more than 50% of my plate. The vegetables I frequently use include potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, garlic, onions, tomatoes, eggplants, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, zucchini, and bell peppers.

Although my family isn't particularly fond of the taste of vegetables, I have discovered ways to enhance their flavor over the past 1-2 years. By cutting them into small cubes of around 5mm and combining them with meat, eggs, fungi, various spices and cooked in a pan with olive oil. (steamed is absolut no go)

Preparing small cubes of vegetables for 4-6 people (each person consuming 2 large-sized plates) typically takes me around half an hour. While I admit that I am not particularly fast with a knife, I have already explored videos on improving my cutting speed without much success.

I have purchased a device few years ago, the Bosch MaxoMixx blender full set, for this purpose, but it has consistently experienced damage. Additionally, we have access to a large commercial machine, which was obtained from my uncle who used it in a motel. While it performs well, it requires more time and effort to clean, and it is cumbersome and heavy to carry into the kitchen.

Therefore, I am seeking recommendations for a reliable, robust, easy-to-clean, safe (preferably not a mandoline slicer), and reasonably sized vegetable slicer or device that can efficiently cut vegetables into cubes measuring approximately 5mm to 10mm.

"Heating 400 frozen pierogi in bulk in home kitchen for private event Hi all, I'm catering an event for 80-100 this summer and the hosts want to do pierogi / varenyky (they're Ukrainian). They have a local vendor I am going to buy frozen varenyky from a local vendor. It'll be 400-500 of the little guys.

I'm totally stuck on how best to heat &amp; serve these in a home kitchen. I can bring in some equipment where needed. This is a bit out of my comfort zone on this and I'm really worried about them sticking together. The pierogi are a bit thicker-skinned, but still seems like they'd stick together if not managed right.

Here are the two options I had considered so far:

Option 1: Outdoor boil in massive pot

* Bring an outdoor, portable burner (like you'd do for frying a turkey or outdoor wok cooking, not a tool we regularly use but the hosts are OK with the added expense). I visited the site and just don't trust their home stove for a large enough pot of water.
* Boil varenyky in batches, remove with a spider, then move to serving pans with lots of melted butter.
* Toss in butter and cover pan with foil
* Hold warm in oven for 1-2 hours before serving (will be a buffet, so we'd prep several pans and hold them in the oven and replenish the chafing dishes while serving)

Option 2: 'steam' in sealed pans in oven (based on a prior AC thread)

* Thaw pierogi in walk-in uncovered so exterior dries slightly
* Toss pierogi in melted butter
* Place in serving pan and cover tight with foil
* Warm in oven for an hour or two around 120C / 250F
* Transfer to chafing dishes as needed, same as in option 1

Is Option 2 even viable? If so, do I need to keep them in a single layer, or is it possible to go 2-3 deep in a home oven?

I'm going to test either option out in advance, but the thermodynamics are going to be so different on event day and I can't test at a meaningful volume.

A few hundred bucks in extra equipment is fine, but we're just going to have 4 folks doing the on-site prep &amp; service so can't be too operationally painful (having somebody man an outdoor burner is fine, the rest of the food is really easy).

Are there other approaches to consider here? If Option 1 is the way, anybody have any tips on how to batch the cooking, size of pot, and how long they could hold in the oven without falling apart?

Thanks so much for any tips, it's for a wedding celebration and want to help the hosts celebrate their Ukrainian culture on the big day.",nalnalnalnalnal,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1512gc3/heating_400_frozen_pierogi_in_bulk_in_home/,1689501919.0,0.75

"Why did my ghee boil over? I was making ghee today, same as I have before with the same stove, por, butter, etc. It was boiling gently and still had a little ways to go, so I stepped away from the kitchen for a moment (yes, in hindsight I recognize this was not the wisest choice and next time I will be more attentive). I came back and found the ghee boiled over and completely covered the stove with an oily mess. The milk solids which hadn’t started to brown yet were suddenly crispy dark brown, close to black, and the ghee is also a dark brown color.

I cleaned up the best I could and as far as I can tell the ghee didn’t actually burn. It’s very dark but it has a nutty taste, not burnt, and the solids tasted also nutty and not burnt. But I’ve never had ghee spill over that way before. I’m wondering what happened exactly? And how I can prevent it from boiling over again.

Also if anyone has tips on how to make ghee (not clarified butter, I’m looking for that nuttiness of ghee) more easily with consistently good results that would be appreciated.

"How can naan recipes vary so much and where did I go wrong? I always thought baking was pretty rigid, as far as following recipes was concerned. But then I saw two naan recipes(one from Kenji and one from King Arthur flour) using vastly different proportions of ingredients. The yeast, salt, sugar, and water are pretty similar but the ratio of flour and yogurt varies a ton.

https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/naan-recipe (uses ~2 cups of a mix of bread/ap flour and 5 tbsp of yogurt)
https://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-naan-recipe (4 cups of just bread flour and 1 3/4 cup of yogurt)

This gave me the unearned confidence to try and split the difference and my naan turned out more like focaccia bread. The dough doubled in size but didn't seem like the right consistency and I had to use a lot of extra flour to make sure it wasn't sticking everywhere. I don't think I kneaded enough or correctly and I don't have a stand mixer, so that could've been where I went wrong instead of the recipe.

I was just kind of winging it and I've also never baked any kind of bread, so I'm not surprised at the result. It actually tastes good and all I was gonna do was dip it in the hummus I made and it works fine for that, so a relative success.

- Tiny bit of fresh mint


Creaminess &amp; funk from feta, freshness &amp; sourness from mint &amp; apple, sweet &amp; earthy from carrot, tartness/bite &amp; crunch from jicama and red onion, anise &amp; crunch from fennel, walnuts give it a fatty overlay, the champagne dressing highlights the sweet and sour notes while giving it tang and a tiny bit of heat from hot paprika.

The cores I am making can have different flavors:

\- Milk chocolate  
\- White chocolate  
\- Pistachio cream  
\- Nutella  
\- Peanut butter

and others.  


At the moment I am experiementing with ganache, the problem is that if I move far from dark chocolate, then I cannot freeze the ganache into a ball, to then put it into a cookie.

I tried using white chocolate for Peanut butter ganache in a ratio 2:1 and it does not freeze very well, it remains sort of liquid.

Now, I am also looking into Cremeux but I don't know if it's the right choice. I am also thinking about using cocoa butter directly for Nutella, Peanut butter etc.

Why I am doing this? Because I do not like the mouth feel of plain Nutella, Peanut butter and other spredables, they are too thick and when you chew them they dry your mouth. So I am diluting them by creating a ganache, in order to have their flavor but also give a smooth and creamy texture.

"Help with dinner progression and ideas I’m planning a dinner for 5-7 people. I’m shooting for 5 courses. There is no set theme, but I plan to start with a trompe l’oeil dessert amuse bouche and end with a trompe l’oeil breakfast dessert.

1 bite: cupcake or dessert

The easiest and most boring idea is a smoked salmon mousse on top of a fast pickled cucumber slice topped with salmon eggs made to look like a mini cupcake. The more adventurous idea would be a savory French macaron with a Gruyère duxelles.

App: pork adobo or salmon skin ochazuke

Filipino pork adobo. Pork belly if I want to get fancy, but more than likely it will be carnitas cuts that I’ll simmer or pressure cook. I have my recipe for this where I’ll traditional caramelize the onions and then add it in with browned pork and then slow simmer or let the onions disintegrate in the pressure cooker. Then I’ll take pickled eggplants and have it on the side.

For the ochazuke I’ve made a hondashi genmaicha that goes well for ochazuke. The salmon skin will have a thin layer of meat left on. I’ll pan fry skin side til crisp. When it’s added to the porridge the oils should mix well. Playing with the idea of zesting a calamnsi instead of wasabi.

Salad/cleanser: tomato and arugula salad

Oven roasted/dried cherry tomatoes and arugula with a calamansi &amp; bagoong(fermented shrimp paste) dressing.

Main: steak

Tomahawk ribeye either reverse seared or sous vide(butter finish). Wasabi sour cream. Baked Tajin dusted maitake mushrooms. Baked asparagus.

Dessert: egg toast

Salt and white pepper sponge cake with a coconut pudding and lemon or calamnsi curd. Made to look like a quail egg on toast. My original idea was a play on honey toast, but I think it’s too much sweet so I’m changing the base to savory sponge.

How does my progression look? Cupcake &amp; adobo vs macaron &amp; ochazuke, salad, steak, toast.

Prep and cook looks manageable alone. Macarons shells, cake, pudding, and curd can be made ahead. Not much fine knife work needed. Only things touching the stove are duxelles/ochazuke or pork adobo and steak depending on cook. Oven is just veg for mains.

Does my steak need a sauce? If so I can make a miso, soy, mirin reduction and scrap the wasabi sour cream. I don’t know how it will play with the tajin, but it shouldn’t clash.",guamsdchico,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14z55kf/help_with_dinner_progression_and_ideas/,1689305530.0,0.57
"Chocolate sticking to 1 mold, but not the other?? I started making bon bons a couple weeks ago and have a lot of success with it (with the occasional bump).

My problem is when frying the marinade forms this fond on the bottom of the pan which is impossible to scrape off unless I boil water in it and start scraping. This layer of fond forming means the beef doesn’t brown.

"Attempting chinese crispy pork belly tomorrow and need some pointers. Growing up i have always known the chinese crispy pork belly. So yesterday i ordered some pork belly with skin through work and got almost 10 kg of pork belly....

So im going to make chinese crispy pork belly tomorrow. The process in a broad sense is:

- Boil in water to soften skin  
- poke holes in skin
- Dry skin with salt overnight (ill probably not going to wait overnight, just a couple hours)  
- Season the meat  
- Wrap skin part only in aluminium foil and leave skin exposed  
- Use some vinegar on skin  
- Roast in oven  
- Rest the meat and done  

But i went to thailand and followed a thai cooking course for 1 week where we made MOO KROB, this looks EXACTLY like the chinese roasted pork apart from the seasoning. But the technique seems more fool proof. Which is after partially cooking in the oven they deep fry it, skin first and then drop the entire piece of meat. 

The result was amazing but it has been 2 years since ive done it and the last time i did this at home it wasnt as crispy and the skin was too gelatine like and sticking to your teeth. 

So the difference i see is that the thai style moo krob deep fries it while the chinese recipe only uses the oven. I feel like i should deep fry it and kinda want to do it this way. But last attempt didnt go to well. 

So im going to try it again the same way and probably test a couple different batches since ive got so much pork belly anyway. But do you guys have any pointers or tips i can use or mistakes i can spot? 

Ps. For the oven version only i saw chinese cooking demystified used baking soda on the skin to make it more crispy so i will try that too. But i also read that actually adding some moister back into the skin will make it more crispy, this actually makes sense to me (with the other methods i feel you make the skin hard which is mistaken for crunchy).

"Is there an easy way to use all the tiny cloves that come with my garlic? My local garlic bulbs are about 30% tiny cloves, maybe less than half what you'd expect a regular clove to be.

"How to get more Thai Tea flavor in this flan? Hi there, I used this recipe I found on YT and was pretty underwhelmed with the actual thai tea flavor in the end product. I even used 4 thai tea bags instead of the recommended 1-2. The texture of the flan came out perfectly but bc the recipe didn't call for sugar in the custard, I thought that the bitter caramel didn't really balance well with the custard(custard wasn't very sweet at all.) 


I want a stronger thai tea flavor and I was wondering if I could use thai tea in making the caramel (it calls to use hot water to finish the caramel) or add thai tea (cooled) in while whisking the eggs to get a stronger tea flavor. Does anyone have any advice? 


Thank you!



Thai Milk Tea Crème Caramel


What you’ll need


* Caramel
* 80g sugar
* 2 tbsp room temp water
* 2 tbsp hot water

Pudding


* 2 large eggs (approx 50g-52g each without shell), room temp
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 400g full fat milk
* 130g evaporated milk
* 76g condensed milk
* 40g hot water
* 2 Thai milk tea packets (or more)



Making it


* The Caramel Heat sugar and room temp water on medium low heat in a pot until dark amber. Swirl the pot occasionally to ensure the sugar heats evenly. 
* Turn off the flame and add the hot water once the caramel has reached your desired colour. Take care to add the water gently and to stay at a safe distance because it will splutter. 
* Immediately distribute the caramel amongst the 4 ramekins and let sit until caramel sets is no longer soft like a liquid. (See note above if you caramel hardens before you portion it) Whilst the caramel cools, prepare the custard mixture. 


The Custard Mixture 


* Preheat your oven to 150C convection mode. 
* Whisk the eggs and vanilla together in a big bowl until smooth and set aside. 
* Add 2 Thai milk tea bags to your pot and add the hot water. Set aside to steep for a few minutes. 
* Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk and milk to the pot with the tea bags and heat on medium low until bubbles form around the edges. Do not bring it to a boil. 
* Occasionally press the tea bag against the sides of the pot to extract the tea from the bags. Turn off heat once you start to see small bubbles or steam and remove the tea bags.
* Slowly pour the milk tea mixture to the eggs whilst whisking to tempter the eggs and bring the temperature of the eggs up. Start slow to ensure you do not scramble the eggs. 
* Sieve pudding mixture into your measuring cup or and cup with a lip to ensure easy pouring. 
* Divide the mixture into your ramekins and let sit for 10mins to allow bubbles to rise to the surface. Use a toothpick to pop any bigger bubbles (optional). 
* Cover the ramekins tightly with some aluminium foil and place them into a larger tray with a tall rim (I use a 8″x8″ baking tin). Add boiling water until it comes to being slightly halfway up the ramekin. Bake at 150C for 35-40 mins until just set around the edges. 
* When ready you should be able to see a really fluid wobble but it shouldn’t be liquid. (refer to the video for a guide) Remove from the tray of water. Cool on a wire rack on your counter for 30 mins before refrigerating overnight. 
* To serve, simple loosen the edges with the tip of a knife, place a plate on top and flip it upside down. Spin the plate to get it to release. Alternatively, run a knife all the way down the sides of the ramekin to loosen it fully.",CapedBaldyman,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14vjezy/how_to_get_more_thai_tea_flavor_in_this_flan/,1688962567.0,0.71

"Are these issues with the wok induction hob I bought worth returning it over? I bought an induction hob specifically for woks and there's a few things about it I'm not enjoying, I wanted to check with people who reguarly use a wok if this is a me problem or a problem with the cooker.

1. Heats a hollow ring / donut at the bottom of the wok instead of the centre, the very centre of the wok is not that hot. When I seasoned my wok the centre of the wok did not get hot enough unless I rotated the wok so it was in the donut shaped hot zone. The wok does fit the groove. There's a cool zone of diamater approx 2 inches at the centre of the wok. I can literally touch the centre of the pan while the hot zone is hot enough for the leidenfrost effect to kick in when water gets on it.
2. On lower power outputs the hob cycles on and off instead of outputting a smooth ammount of low power heat
3. There's no way to turn off the ""temperature control"" feature where it prevents the pan going above a certain temperature on each power setting. What I wanted was a continous output like a gas hob where I can just pull the pan away / turn it down if there's an issue.

I just wanted to check that these things are actually undesirable and not an issue with the way I'm cooking before I make a complaint. From what I understood it was a critical component of stir frying that the heat be concentrated in the very centre of the wok?

"My chicken melted my aluminium foil??? Did a simple chicken brine (4kg chicken, added 50ml light soy, 50ml dark soy, 50ml honey, 200ml water) in a large metal bowl and covered it with aluminium foil since I ran out of cling wrap. Placed it in the fridge overnight thinking all will be good since I've done this countless times.

Morning comes, I pull the bowl out to mix the meat up and holy cow, the foil that sagged to the point of being in contact with the chickenn flesh ""melted"" away and became perforated. The part of the chicken that ""melted"" the foil was crusty and darkened - I sliced it off and dumped the browned bits.

I'm so confused as to what happened, it's the first time I encountered this. Was there some displacement of iron ions with aluminium ions? Is something else happening?

"Sauerkraut lost liquid whole fermenting - good to continue? I am in the process of making a batch of sauerkraut following Brad Leone’s recipe from Bon Appetit. The cabbage did not release much liquid after salting/massaging during the initial packing stage so I used a 2% brine to cover the cabbage. 

I checked it today after 2 weeks in the fermenter and there did not appear to be much liquid at all in there. It did not smell off or have any mold or rottenness that I can tell. It did have some fermenty and funky smell and a slight sauerkraut taste, so I think it’s generally working. 

I added more 2% brine to completely submerge all the cabbage this time. Are there any worries or red flags you see about it having not been totally in liquid for some amount of time?

Hello! I would like to learn about how powdered food flavors, specifically the artificial fruit flavors found in pre-workouts supplements and products like Kool-aid and Tang are made.

"Best method with cold fermentation for 85% 48hr hydration dough Hello there! This is my second time making pinsa, I’m using [this recipe/tutorial by babish &amp; ethan](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/protein-pizza), however it is not very clear in terms of what to do if you’re using cold fermentation, my plan is to bump the hydration to 85% instead, and I have a food processor if that makes the process easier. 

However, my question is:

1. Since I’m already doing cold ferment, should I use food processor for autolyse? Or is that unnecessary since it will be cold fermented anyway? 

2. Is there a benefit about using stretch and folds + cold foil AND cold fermentation or is it redundant because again, it will be refrigerated for at least 48 hrs? 

I saw a recipe that does all of the methods above, [autolyse, stretch and folds, cold foil AND cold ferment overnight (he also cut the dough with scissors too?)](https://youtu.be/lF9FKKjPKPg)

So my question is, if there is any significant difference between each method, which one(s) are necessary and which aren’t, and when do one over the other, or both.

However, it takes me a long time (especially with my bad back and having to go outside to cut stuff on my recycling bin) to chop garlic – and also, I pretty much triple the amount of garlic any recipe calls for, anyway. So for example the other day I made four cans of San Marzano tomatoes into a pasta sauce and ended up using fuor garlic bulbs and even that wasn’t strong enough for me! Lol!


So basically garlic is cheap as doodles! but with the amount of time that it takes (at least me), the simple amount of labor that it takes to chop/peel garlic is so time-consuming that the amount of **labor** that you put into chopping it is worth over quadruple (imo) than what the garlic even costs itself. 

That being said, even if you were to use a whole bulb of garlic while simmering marinara sauce, yeah sure maybe not all the flavors will come out of it as much, but that can simply be fixed by simply buying more garlic – and garlic like I said, it’s cheap as ditzly-doodles. I’d rather spend double the amount of money on garlic and not have to chop anything than anything else.

But my main concern here is will the skin and peels break off into the marinara sauce if you just throw whole bulbs in there.  OR what if you take the big papery skin off the outside of the general-bulb, and just throw the unpeeled cloves in, worst case scenario?

"Is it worth doing a Wellington with the head of the fillet? I am a vegetarian of 10+ years so I'm not really familiar with the various cuts of meat.
I'll be cooking a Wellington this weekend for my mum's birthday. At my local butcher I asked for a 1kg steak fillet (I'm in the EU) and specifically said it was for a beef Wellington. When I got it home I soon realised I'd been given the head portion, and it had a lot of silverskin and connective tissue as well. 

I gave a stab at prepping it for the Wellington with my limited experience with meat, I got all the silverskin off anyway and I've ended up with a fairly cylindrical peice of meat when it's tied but it does have that gap at one end where the top of the fillet ends.


Anyway, has anyone had success doing a Wellington with this cut of meat? Or should I really try and get a tenderloin centre cut/chateubriand tomorrow? 
I'm mainly worried about any tough connective tissue at the head end I might've missed. I'm not too worried about the Wellington cooking at different rates as I'll have different people who will want different done-ness on their slice anyway - I'll aim for medium rare at the centre.

"Understanding what works in a salad Hi y'all,

I've been tossing all the veggies that I like in a bowl and adding salad dressing to it. But today I realized that maybe certain ingredients are likely making my salad taste kinda bland. So I have some questions as I'm trying to learn how to cook better:

1. Does adding too much salad dressing (I use store bought dressing) cause the salad to lose flavour? I thought I underdressed my salad after I tasted it, but when I added more dressing, it seemed to have decreased the flavour.
2. Are there certain ingredients that overpower or take flavour away?
3. Can you suggest some veggie combinations and dressing types?
4. Perhaps troubleshoot what I did wrong in my recipe below:

For context, I made a salad that had:

* spring mix
* a tiny bit more spinach
* little bit of broccoli
* almost a full red peppers
* 1/4 of a large cucumber
* 1 medium sized carrot
* and a few cut mushrooms

I used **Kraft Sun-Dried Tomato &amp; Oregano** dressing , and then topped with a bit of sunflower seeds and half a sliced apple.

I'm thinking maybe the dressing itself isn't very good and bland, seems to have flavour sometimes and sometimes kinda bland. Also thinking that adjusting certain ingredients to have more or less might be what I need to learn.

"Sodium citrate cheese sauce &amp; temperature Hello all, first post here. 

I've been trying out making cheese sauces with sodium citrate recently, I just started experimenting. One thing I've noticed is that the sauce thickens &amp; even slightly separates quickly as it cools. The last time I made mac &amp; cheese with it, it began to become clumpy on the plate, which isn't ideal. I don't know if it's a ratio issue or a technique issue, but I'd hope it would stay emulsified at least long enough to eat it without rushing.

I used a ratio of 100% sharp cheddar, 85% liquid (water, milk, or a blend), 4% sodium citrate. I used a whisk to mix everything, not an stick blender. The mac &amp; cheese in question was served from the pot, and did not sit &amp; cool down before serving.

"Advice on a greek meal course to not overdo things When I was young I never really really cared about food presentation, courses and stuff like that. From where I came from we always put everything on the same plate and each to its own liking. I had some experience with ""menu plates"" as my father worked traveling and often we have this experience when abroad.

I'm not an experienced cook but I can find my way around a kitchen and recently I started caring more about cooking and presentation. I decided to make something special for my SO, a greek homemade dinner with several plates, I don't know if it qualifies as 3-course, 4-course, full-course.

My problem is that I think it's too much varieties on the same meal and I want an opinion of more experienced chefs, here's what I'm planning for food:

* *Spanakopita*, A spinach pie, small, in triangles, as an entree
* *Greek salad*, A very light hearted salad with tomato, cucumber, onion, feta cheese with some slices of bread
* *Lamb chops* with a side of *Horta Vrasta*, Green leafs boiled, kinda like boiled spinach. I think this will be a good combination between the lamb and the earthiness of the herbs
* *Moussaka*, A lasagna replacement, made with eggplant, potato, ground meat and bechamel
* *Souvlaki*, Pork skewers with a side of Fries, Tzatziki (Garlic sauce) and Pitas (bread)
* *Lentil soup* with a couple of vine leaves stuffed with rice and meat

For deserts:

* *Baklava*, A layered pastry with nuts and honey
* *Loukoumades*, fluffy sweet honey balls, deep fried

And finally to drink:

* *Ouzo*, An anise-flavored liquor produced from grape must, probably as an aperitif before the meal
* *Lemonade*
* *Red wine*
* *Frappe*, Cold coffee, with the deserts

On paper it sounds like a good idea, all dishes are going to be small, we have two types salad, a pasta replacement, two different meats (plus the ground beef in the moussaka) and a soup. But I'm afraid it is too much and the flavors would not work together.

"macarons cracked So, I've made macarons a total of three times now. The first time was horrible, as expected; they were blown up and cracked. Second time, I did everything the same way, except I tapped the hell out of the trays and used toothpicks. Came out way better, no cracking, but the feet were smaller than I would've liked; I believe I overmixed it just a little bit. Third time, my batter had that perfect lava, flowing ribbon consistency, and I thought they would come out amazing, but I got the same results as the first time. Blown up, cracked, huge air bubbles, and absolutely no feet. I used preppy kitchen's macaron recipe: [https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons/#recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons/#recipe) 

any ideas what I could've done wrong?? also, i feel like the unbaked macarons had an abnormal amount of air bubbles, and the tapping wasn't doing much, but I could just be paranoid from my failures lol.

"Cream Based Soups Hello, All! 

I work in the kitchen at a casual seafood restaurant, we make cream of crab soup weekly, and up until recently I've had no issues with roux or thickening the soup. For the last 3 weeks or so, the soup has become thinner than usual during the initial cooking process and then goes on to become a thin liquid when it is reheated. 

The ingredients have stayed the same. Time and attention spent cooking has varied from ""take your time"" all the way to ""oh shit were out and we need more in under and hour"" then anywhere in between; and still no issue with thickening. 

Method of warming changed months ago from stirring constantly on the range then into the soup warmer on low...
to warmed in the soup warmer on high for an hour then turned down to low with no issue. 

Now, for the last few weeks I've had issues with the soup only sort of thickening during initial cooking, then thinning out completely when reheated. 

The most noticeable thing that has changed, is the overall temperature of the kitchen, just because summer has started, it's been a hell of a lot hotter behind the line where we cook the soups. 

I'm concerned because we always have a consistent end product that our customers love and expect (of course) and this is just not it.

"Question regarding a pizza dough recipe... Hi everyone, I plan to try making [Kenji’s Foolproof Pan Pizza recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe) in the next few days but there’s one concern – I live in the Philippines, so I’ll have to adjust the recipe in light of our higher temperature and humidity.  
  
Based on Google, on average, room temperature in the Philippines is 27 C or 81 F (in the US average room temperature is 22 C or 72 F). And on average, the humidity rate in the Philippines is 82% compared to the humidity rate in the US which is 40%.  
  
Given these facts and based on some research, my plan is account for the higher temperature and humidity in the Philippines by 1) going for a finished dough temperature of around 21 C or 70 F (using cold water and measuring via an instant read thermometer) and 2) increasing the salt percentage of the dough recipe by 1%.  
  
Do you guys have any comments on these adjustments or have suggestions of your own on how I can best adjust the recipe to match the hotter and more humid Philippine setting? Would lowering my yeast be a good idea? If so, by how much should I lower the yeast?

"Having a flavor issue with Xantham Gum in frozen beverages? So I've been making homemade frozen beverages for a while now. Typically of the matcha variety, more recently have started making a hot chocolate one. For the matcha one, I use milk, matcha powder, ice, brown sugar, and xantham gum, which was included in many recipes I found online to help mimic the thickness of Starbucks' 'Matcha Frappuccino' (I have a bit of an obsession and not enough money to support said obsession).

My issue is whenever I use the xantham gum (Bob's Red Mill brand), all I taste in the matcha drink is this strange licorice-esque flavor. I've tried all different kinds of matcha powders and the taste is still there. In drinks that don't use the xantham gum, the matcha tastes perfectly fine, so I can only deduce that the xantham gum is causing the weird taste.

Even in the hot chocolate freeze (which uses the same ingredients as the matcha drink, except swapping matcha powder for the hot chocolate powder and skipping the brown sugar) there's still that strange underlying taste that can only be coming from the xantham gum.

From what I've seen online, xantham gum is supposed to be flavorless. So why am I somehow tasting it in the drinks I'm making? Is it reacting with the other flavors to create the strange taste? Is there any way to counter it so I don't taste the xantham gum?

"How to make pork chops insanely tender? Last week, I went to a southern food restaurant and had smothered pork chops (covered in gravy) that I fell in love with and decided to try and replicate.

The flavor was easy to match but i'm having trouble with the texture. I could pretty much cut them with just my fork, nearly as easily as a ground beef patty. They were either thin cut or pounded thin (maybe slightly less than a centimeter). 

My first thought was a slow braise. So with my first attempt, I stewed some thin cut chops in gravy for 3 hours (after a quick sear). The texture was pretty much there, but they were dried out. After some research, I learned that lean cuts don't do well in a braise. 

For my second attempt, I decided to brine them for 4 hours and pound the shit out of them with a waffle mallet, then cook them normally. This was slightly less tender than the braised chops, and nearly as dry since I slightly over-seared them. But I was confident that even if I hadn't overcooked them, it wouldn't have been as tender as the braise. 

I even threw some baking soda into one of my brine batches to see if that would tenderize it more, but it didn't seem to make a difference.

"Soup-only menu Hi! I read about the time Mario Batali did a soup tasting menu for Jim Gaffigan’s wife who could not eat solids, and find myself in a similar situation. My wife is going through some medical treatment that makes solid food difficult and I’d love to make her a dinner for her birthday. I’m an above average home cook (no industry experience) who regularly makes stocks, stews, consommés, etc. 

So for all you menu-creating geniuses, how would you construct a soup only menu? 3-4 courses-ish following app/entree/dessert path.

"Killing yeast by letting air in/securing container ? I tried my hand at cold fermenting pizza dough recently, and had a batch almost overflow out of the container (it separated the lid enough for air to enter, but not enough for dough to come out of the tupperware) on day 4. When I saw this, I secured the lid harder without touching/punching down the dough. In the evening, it was totally deflated, and stayed the same for several days (no rising). I baked it today and it seemed like the dough hadn't risen even though the taste was clearly that of fermented dough, I could still see some compact dough without any bubbles.

  
For context, I used a 70% hydration dough with 2% salt, 2% instant yeast and 6% olive oil. I did an initial bulk rise before dividing in different containers and refrigerating. I bake on a pizza stone at 250°C/480°F, I baked the portions of dough on day 1, day 3 and for the one that I had problems with, day 8. The other doughs were perfect.

"How to convert a 9"" cheesecake recipe to a 7"" cheesecake Hi, i went ahead to buy 3 blocks of cheese per this [recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/cheesecake-recipe/) until I realised I needed a 9"" springform pan. 

The thing is I have a small kitchen. So I am very practical about my tools. I don't wish to buy a 9"" pan specially for this recipe. 

Would you have tips on how to modify to suit a 7"" pan? 😅

Alternatively if I google for 7"" cheesecake recipes, I realise I've bought one extra bar of cheese. Hence I'm not sure how to use that up..

This is the recipe from preppy kitchen:
Ingredients
For the Crust:
▢1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs (180g)
▢¼ cup unsalted butter melted
▢2 tablespoons granulated sugar
For the Filling:
▢3 (8-ounce/227g) blocks cream cheese room temperature
▢1 cup granulated sugar (200g)
▢¼ teaspoon salt
▢2 teaspoons vanilla extract (10mL)
▢3 large eggs room temperature
▢½ cup sour cream room temperature (120g)

1. Combine the cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Stir together until the mixture feels like wet sand. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan using the bottom of a glass or measuring cup. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool while making the filling.

2. Place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until creamy and smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is well combined and completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the bowl a few times during mixing.


4. Stop and scrape down the bowl between additions.

5. Once the eggs are well combined, mix in the sour cream until well incorporated.

6. Bake for 15 minutes before reducing the oven temperature and continue baking for another 30 to 35 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door closed for 1 hour. Remove the cheesecake and let cool at room temperature for another hour, then chill for at least 6 hours or up to 3 days before serving.",Sweet_Cost306,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14nvo61/how_to_convert_a_9_cheesecake_recipe_to_a_7/,1688219497.0,0.83
"Vegan mayo with soy lecithin granules instead of soy milk? Hey everybody,

I love making mayo, and have used whole eggs for a long time before I went vegan. Since then I tried to make it work with aquafaba and soy milk, which generally went great - however, both these ingredients pose a practical problem for me.If I want to use aquafaba I have to either use up a whole can of chickpeas everytime I want to make mayo (or at least use it up at a reasonable time after opening it). Health wise that would probably be an advantage, kind of forcing me to incorporate more legumes into my diet, but its just kind of impractical. The other option would be to get separated aquafaba at a store, but even then I'm not sure about how long I could store that in the fridge.The soy milk option gives me better results. Unfortunately I prefer oat milk for any other situations (e.g. in coffee), so I can't effectively use up a whole carton of soy milk unless I make tons of mayo.

Since there is no pulverized soy milk available yet (like with oat milk), I thought about using soy lecithin granules from the drug store, so I could just take the amount I need for a batch of mayo and then easily store the rest. However, with these granules I've had nothing but failures yet.My recipe so far was mostly about a Tbsp of lemon juice, a Tbsp of mustard, somewhere between 3 and 5 g of soy lecithin granules, salt and pepper and about 200 ml of granola oil. Mixing up all ingredients except for the oil first, then adding the oil and blending it with an immersion blender (sticking it right down a narrow beaker, then going full blast and slowly lifting it up).

The results so far reminded me of how regular egg yolk mayo breaks when you pull up the immersion blender too quickly (or if using a whisk: adding oil too quickly). Its just a greasy mess, with air bubbles quickly emerging from the liquid.

Have any of you tried making vegan mayo with soy lecithin granules instead of soy milk/aquafaba? Is there something like a conversion chart for X g soy lecithin granules equals one regular egg yolk for example?  


Edit: I have looked for what seemed like an eternity for me so find info on this on google, but so far the only recipe even mentioning soy lecithin I could find was from [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-vegan-mayo-aquafaba-recipe-vegan-experience), and he just mentioned some sprinkles to help an already prepared vegan mayo to keep its shape/consistency. I don't know if he is using granules or a more pure powder, though.

"How did I go wrong? I got this
https://postimg.cc/B8DQfmF7
But I was attempting to make something like this: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8ea39GQ/
vegan friendly.

I used a regular full sized watermelon, scooped it out, pureed the meat and filtered out the pulp, added a little mint, 4 tbsp of sugar,  and 4 cups of lemon juice, brought the mixture to a low boil and stirred in the agar agar. 

The instructions on the bottle said to use 1/2 teaspoon of agar powder to 1/2 cup liquid. There were 18 cups of liquid and I used the whole bottle of 19 tsp of powder (because it sounded like the lemon juice might need more gel power due to it's acidity).

The agar agar powder was challenging to incorporate so I stirred it in slowly, to prevent clumping, then let it simmer for only 2 minutes instead of the 5 as directed.

Poured the mixture into the watermelon, added about 2 cups of rum to return the mixture to the full 18 cups as some had boiled off I guess, stirred and sweet in fridge overnight.

I woke up to a mold that had set, but it looked like marbled meat almost, with a ton of fat. The flavor isn't great, very bland, and the texture is rubbery, and the worst part is it looks disgusting.

"Question about pizza making from a pizza newb Hi everyone, so I'm about to have my first go at making pizza in a few days. I just bought the ingredients and I'm waiting for them to come at the moment.  
  
I was wondering though, is making a larger pizza simply a matter of using more dough? So for example, if a recipe says that it can yield two twelve inch pizzas, can I simply use more dough so that I can make a 16 inch pizza using my Ooni oven (and the quality of the larger 16 inch remains the same)? Is making a larger pizza just a matter of using more dough using the same dough recipe? Or is a recipe fixed to produce a certain size (i.e. if it says it produces two twelve inch pizzas, you can't add more dough to turn it into a 16 inch pizza while retaining the same quality, you need to stick to what the recipe says -- if it says 12 inches do 12 inches).

"Why are my cutting boards warping? I bought 2 nice cutting boards to replace my REALLY old splitting wood boards and plastic boards.  

One 15""x20""x1.5"" teak board and one 18x24x0.75"" maple board.  

I cleaned them and oiled them twice for 24 hours before use.  They live on my counter and I clean them like my counter tops.  Wipe down with a soapy sponge and dry very well with a rag.  Somehow the maple board is super warped after its second use.  I can rock it side to side.  

How is this possible?  It wasn't warped 45 minutes ago before I started cooking.  All I did was cut 2 onions and a bundle of scallions...

"Question about salt and marinading So I have started reading Salt fat acid heat (SFAH) and have found it amazing so far! Yet, when I try to search up certain points made in the book for further reading I am met by contradicting statements.

For example, reading an article about marinating it states that 'salt may draw out the moisture of the meat' and not to salt too much when marinating and rather salt while or after cooking. 

Both these points are in direct contrast to what I am currently reading in the book. 

In SFAH Samin Nosrat writes ""Because salt also iniatiates osmosis, and visibly draws out water out of nearly any ingridient it touches, many people believe that salt dries and toughens food. But with time, salt will dissolve protein strands into a gel, allowing them to absorb and retain water better as they cook. Water is moisture: its presence makes meat tender and juicy"" (SFAH, p.30)

So... Which is right? 


Also as a follow up question to what I actually wanted to find out; does marinating achieve the same effect as salting does? As in penetrating the meat, making it juicier?

Thanks!

"Question about Turkish Delight When is the best time to add the rose water? All of the recipes that I've seen add the rose water flavoring as the last step, and that makes sense in terms of preserving flavor, but most of the process is removing moisture from the syrup, so adding in liquid at the end feels a bit counterintuitive. Am I just overthinking this, or is the timing important?

Here is the recipe I am currently making for reference (and if it's bad, then please point me to a better one): https://www.thespruceeats.com/turkish-delight-lokum-2355454


4 1/4 cups water, divided
4 cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/4 cups cornstarch, divided
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 tablespoons rose water
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

1 1/2 cups of water mix with sugar and lemon juice. Boil until 240F. Remove from heat then make starch mixture with 2 3/4 cups of the water, the starch, and cream of tartar. Once that reaches glue like consistency then add sugar mix and stir rapidly for five minutes, then reduce heat to low and let simmer for an hour until golden brown, stirring frequently (I am using a double boiler for the simmering step this time). Add rose water into 9×9 pan and then pour into greased 9×9 pan (grease, wax paper, more grease). Then let set for a long time, cut into squares and toss in corn starch and powered sugar.

"Getting the texture right on red lentil vegetable stew I made lentil vegetable stew yesterday. The recipe essentially was:

1. Sweat butternut squash, onions, carrots, garlic, and ginger
2. Add tomato paste, lentils, stock, and spices
3. Cook for 60 to 90 minutes

When the lentils were done after an hour (overdone, actually; they were very mushy), there was still way too much liquid in the dutch oven. The recipe called for one cup lentils to four cups stock - my main question is, what would an appropriate ratio be? Four to one seems standard for lentils, and I'm wondering why it didn't work.

Two bonus questions:

1. If I wanted to use a summer squash instead, what changes would I make to the recipe? (I actually did use a yellow squash, but had no idea if that was a good idea or not).

"Are meat flavors volatile? James Peterson’s book on sauces describes that stocks loses the ""character, individuality, and freshness"" of meat during their creation. To get a liquid that preserves this natural character, Peterson says to make a jus by browning and deglazing until just barely dissolved. However, it is important to not reduce the liquid even further because it would be detrimental to the jus. 

Now, after reading a similar [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/4o2iil/james_peterson_and_pan_sauces/) regarding the order of how liquids in pan sauces should be reduced and seeing many users including Kenji Lopez-Alt disagreeing with Peterson's claim, I am confused about the whole topic. Peterson says that flavor is lost when pan sauces are reduced and that all deglazing liquids should be reduced before adding to the fond.

It has been documented by Kenji himself [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-do-i-really-need-to-reduce-w) that faster reduced stocks are flatter and less aromatic than slower-reduced stocks, which in turn implies that reducing stocks will always lose volatile aromatics. If this is the case, wouldn't Peterson's claim make sense that some of the meaty and vegetal aromatics in a pan sauce are lost if reduced?  I suppose the reduction time for pan sauces is not long enough to make a substantial difference, which is why many people disagree with Peterson's claims",5Pats,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14k6cvm/are_meat_flavors_volatile/,1687849757.0,0.78

"Chicken Choice Are there certain markers or criteria points in choosing a whole chicken? 

For example I chose a store brand whole chicken over purdue. Because the purdue sell by dates were for June 22 and June 30. Meanwhile, the dates for the store brand were July 03. Which, I feels means they are fresh. I also got to the market in the morning and saw the guy stocking the chicken shelves with new arrivals.

However, there were 4 chickens on-top and then four underneath them on a rack. I saw a chicken underneath for 10.17$ that looked larger. The other chicken I wanted was 10.13 and a little smaller. Then 8.09 and significantly smaller but it just looked good. 

Does a bigger size mean its better? Or does it actually just meatier and perhaps drier?

Can you feel into the chicken and if it is soft does that mean it has a better chance of being juicier? 

Is it better to use the chicken on top that doesn’t touch the rack? In terms of freshness and safety?


For example when I buy steaks I make sure that they have a bone in them, good marbling, good fat content, when they have a blue color on them that means they were just and fresher, I can also tell when a beef cut will be tender and juicy verses tough and meaty. 

I usually tenderize and salt my meats before baking them covered on different heats for a really juicy fall of the bone finish. 

I also really like meat fats. I mix them with breads and rice. I also make sauces with them. 

What are these markers for choosing the right whole chicken before the prepping//cooking process even starts?

Can you check for softness // tenderness by touching it? 
Are there more visual cues?
Are the smaller less expensive chickens actually better tasting? Or do they have a tendency to be dry? 
Making thicker looking skin is a good sign?

I want to start pre-making my meals, and I figure I might as well start learning from these mistakes now.

"Adding water to brownie or chocolate chip cookies to increase ""snap and chew""? Some time ago I had a little mishap when I was making my favourite brownie recipe, which starts with melting butter and chocolate in a water bath. When removing the top bowl with the melted ingredients, it slipped a bit and some of the water in the water bath came in.  I had no more chocolate to start again and was in a rush, so I just kept going and hoped for the best. Well, I thought the brownies came out more amazing than ever that time. Chewier, and the crispy top felt particularly crispy. I have always wondered whether the water may have made a difference, but I thought that was silly and I was imagining things.

Well, I was watching a video of Molly Baz's halva chocolate chip cookies today, and after she makes brown butter, she adds an ice cube, and says that it's ""so there is some water, to create snap and chew"" ([video](https://youtu.be/r_5wErKGHT0), it's at about 2:20). So maybe the water actually did help that time with the brownies?  

I'd really appreciate a) any insights into whether this technique actually works, and the science involved, and b) if it does work, any tips on how to use it. How much water? Should it be always added to the butter, or at any point in the mixing? And does adding the water in ice cube form make a difference, or does the temperature not have an influence? (I'm guessing Molly Baz was using ice because she wanted to cool down the brown butter a bit)

"Why roast chickpeas for hummus? One my favorite hummus recipes comes from Ori Manashe, an Israeli-American chef who has a cool restaurant in Los Angeles called Bavel.

I use the recipe from the Bavel cookbook, and a lot of it seems pretty standard: soak chickpeas overnight, cook them in water, blend and mix with tahini and other stuff.

There's always one step, though, that's sort of puzzled me: after soaking, he has you toss the soaked chickpeas in baking soda and roast them for about 8 minutes. Then they go into water to get cooked.

I've followed this recipe to the letter every time with great results. I'm just curious what the roasting accomplishes. Any ideas?",GothAlgar,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14ix57g/why_roast_chickpeas_for_hummus/,1687726765.0,0.81

"Need to make Gluten Free Mac and Cheese Hi.  My kid just got diagnosed with Celiacs, so I am figuring out how to modify his favorite mac and cheese recipe to be gluten free.  The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of flour and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs.  Those are the two items that i need to find an alternative for.  I already swapped out the macaroni for gluten free pasta.  What would you suggest?  For the flour, I have seen Bob Red Mill's Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour, chickpea flour, almond flour as suggestions from Google....  For the breadcrumbs, I just don't know - toasted cocoanut is probably too weird for my kid.

In the recipe, the tablespoon of flour is combined with two tablespoons of melted butter, cooked to translucent onion, a pinch of black pepper, teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of powdered mustard.  Then a 1 1/2 cups of whole milk is added and stirred to thicken.  I then add a block and a half of shredded cheddar cheese to finish out the sauce.  This is then combined with the noodles.  I then top the cheese sauce covered noodles with 3/4 cups of toasted bread crumbs and then bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.",duckworth33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14j08w0/need_to_make_gluten_free_mac_and_cheese/,1687734242.0,0.59
"Why the shading in my banana bread loaf? I used a bread machine recipe (very close to Flour's banana bread) for a banana loaf in my Zojirushi bread maker. But it came out with the lower half of the bread a bit more moist/dark than the upper -- is there anything I can adjust to have the crumb come out more uniformly colored next time?

I can't change pan or heat setting as it's fixed by the bread machine.  Just the amounts of liquids and dry ingredients used. 

Ingredients
200 grams all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon or 6 grams baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon or 3 grams salt
200 grams sugar
2 large eggs, beaten
100 grams olive oil

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

"What am I doing wrong whith my stainless steel pan? So I’ve bought what I consider a mid stainless steel pan for steaks and other recipes with meat, but 80% of the time food sticks to it and burns the bottom. 

For example, I wanted to cook some pork chops. I let the pan heat until I poured some water droplets and they ran around like mercury. Then I added about 1 teaspoon sunflower oil on medium heat, let it heat for 1 min and added 2 pork chops with no seasoning. A few minutes in, I turn them and the bottom of the pan was pretty burnt. By the time they were done, the bottom was almost completely black, so I had to wash it in order to cook the next batch. The same happened when cooking chicken, mushrooms and other foods.

Additionally, when I made chicken with mushrooms, even on the lowest heat, I couldn’t add any butter as the recipe mentioned, because it would start smoking almost instantly. This was a video recipe cooked in a stainless steel pan too. 

I see people online all the time saying that “you just have to pre-heat it enough” and my BIL even made me an egg without any oil in his cheap stainless steel pan. 

What am I doing wrong?

"How can I find a consistent cooking time for creme brulee? [Here's](https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com/recipes/creme-brulee) the recipe I'm using. I follow up to step 10, but then I use a water bath. Specifically, I heat oven to 300 F, put the full ramekins in a 9x13 glass dish, put that in the oven, then pour boiling water into that up to about 2/3 up the ramekins. 

This makes delicious creme brulee. However, I'm very frustrated because I can't get a consistent cook time. Even with this higher temperature, sometimes it takes insanely long to cook. Like, an hour and a half. Other times it's only taken 40-45 minutes. It sucks because the unpredictability means I have to baby it and watch it constantly. That's a long time to have to pay close attention to something, so it's really making creme brulee prohibitively tedious to make. Which it should not be!

Sorry for the long introduction, but hopefully my background with provide you with some context. With my experience in all that, I have looking to learn fine dining techniques and presentation and stuff. For that, I have asked my chef and most of them have told me to look into French cuisine. But as French cuisine is well developed/well documented, there are so many resources to look into that I am getting confused. So I am looking for a recipe book (certainly does not have to be French cuisine) or maybe even a book from culinary institutes,  that is a no-nonsense book with recipes that will provide me with an understanding of why I am learning that recipe and how the techniques used in those recipes can be translated.

"Can someone explain boil houses to me? I know what a seafood boil is (at least generally) although I don't live in a place where they're remotely common, and to be honest, I've never done one myself. I always had the impression that you just put the seafood you want together with the spices you want and boil it all together. Recently, however, I was watching Kitchen Nightmares (s33e10-- about 33 minutes in, the episode is on their official channel if anyone is curious) and Ramsay put a boil house in a seafood restaurant. Everyone was really excited, but the show never explains what the room is and what is done in there. And the shots you see just show seafood and crabs and whatnot crawling around, no shots of equipment or anything. I am very confused about what this room is and why everyone is so excited, and how it's supposed to make life easier for this restaurant. Ramsay says it just runs on its own, which is even more confusing.

"Infusing alcohol Not sure if this is the right place for this since it’s about alcohol, so please direct me to the proper place if appropriate. I want to infuse some alcohol, specifically with a sort of sour preserved plum (Cantonese name is “shin mui” or “assam” in Malay). The recipe given to me is to infuse about 30 pieces per 750ml bottle for 3 days. Would there be any difference or issues if I used less and infused for a longer period? Sadly googling does not help because it’s not a common ingredient. I can’t even find a picture to share!

Similarly, I want to infuse some gin with tea. Would infusing it for a week vs. 1-2 days make a difference? With this one, I’m concerned with bitterness from the tannin.

So far, I've marinaded the chicken for about 36 hours and achieved a quite nice lemony aroma but I'd like to push it further.

I’ve always done it after my onions/garlic have sweated &amp; the tomato paste has toasted to deglaze the pan, like you would a white wine. The alcohol cooks off and the residual sugars of the vodka remain in the sauce, adding flavor.

However, I’ve heard that by adding so early, all of it cooks off and doesn’t really add anything to the dish. Vodka is mostly just alcohol in water solution, so it doesn’t leave behind tannins, sugars, or other flavors, like a wine or beer would.

With the mixing bowls, i notice that after i wash them, i turn them upside down to let them drip dry, but after a few minutes, there is still tons of water clinging to the entire interior surface.

It will dry eventually, of course.  But this doesn't happen on other materials, such as glass, plastic, wood, or even a lot of other steel.  It happens a little on the Farberware, too, but to a far lesser degree.  Is this just how stainless steel works?  Is it the vintage stainless steel or the many years of beating eggs, perhaps?  Am i not cleaning it well enough?  Thanks for any thoughts on the matter.

Normally I wouldn't have any trouble with that but with one recipe there is an ingredient I have no clue how this recipe is going to work.

Ingredients:

500 g Noodles

2 cans of tuna, picked to pieces

1 bunch of basil, picked to pieces

2 balls Mozzarella (à 125 g), cut in half

2 onions, cut in half

1 garlic glove

20 g olive oil

500 g Zucchini, cut in small pieces

3 cans of crushed tomatoes (à 400 g)

350ml Milk

1 ¾ TL salt

¾ TL pepper


I'd start with frying the onions and garlic. Then I'd add the cans of crushed tomatoes, add the basil-leafs and pieces of tuna and salt and pepper, bring it to a boil and let it cook for like 5 mins. Then I'd mix it with the cooked noodles, put everything in a baking tray and putting the mozzarella (which I'd also cut into little pieces) on top and bake it at ~180°C for like 15-20 mins. 


But where does one add the milk? Because adding it to the crushed tomatoes and tuna it sounds to me like everything will be very soup-y at the end. Or did they just add the milk to confuse anyone w/o a paywall?! And thinking about it: Does anyone else also think how 3 cans of crushed tomatoes are a little bit much?

But the bottom layer of beans and tomato sauce burnt and left many beans crunchy and dry. How can I fix it next time?

I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except I added 1/2 cup of water with the crushed tomatoes and used regular tomatoes, not fire roasted. For the beans, I used soaked Rancho Gordo alubia blanca beans that were presumably pretty fresh (ordered within the last month). After the second hour of baking in a dutch oven, some of the beans were still hard (and some were already burnt), so I added another 1/2 cup of water, covered the pot, and cooked it for an extra 40 min. Also, I have a small gas oven, and the only way I can fit the dutch oven in is to use the bottom rack, which is close to the heat.

"When reducing a pan sauce what is the purpose of seasoning up front? Hi All, 

I've often heard one thing that separates professional cooks from home cooks is that they tend to season at all steps of the cooking process. That's mostly made sense to me (seasoning meat prior to cooking has effects other than flavor as an example) but I recently watched a video where the host was making a pan sauce after cooking some chicken breasts. 

He added a little oil, some shallots and garlic, then deglazed with chicken stock. Then he proceeded to bring the sauce to a simmer so it could reduce. 

At that point he said you want to add a little salt and pepper but not too much since if you season it completely it will be too salty after the sauce fully reduces. 

Everything he said made sense except I couldn't figure out the purpose of the seasoning mid reduction. 

If you are going to season to taste once it's reduced and can't fully season now why not wait? 

Is this one of those ""this is how I've always done it"" type things or is there a reason to not just wait until you can fully season the sauce to get the seasoning going?",Shatteredreality,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14em3ge/when_reducing_a_pan_sauce_what_is_the_purpose_of/,1687292703.0,0.85
"Commercial Oven for Grandma Style Pizza We're in the process of opening a pizzeria and bar in the coming year doing exclusively Grandma Style Pizza. This pizza is cooked in a pan at about 550 degrees and in a home oven takes 8-12 minutes depending on toping density and the use of a pizza stone. I'm trying to find out which commercial pizza oven style would work best for this pizza. **I'm not looking for specific brands.**

The restaurant I currently work at offers traditional pizzas though its not there main thing, and they use a conveyor belt style pizza oven. This oven is notoriously slow, but does a good job of evenly cooking the pizzas from what I can tell. It's capacity is questionable as well, maybe 6 pizzas total going at a time from what I can tell. Grandma Style can be slightly smaller in surface area since it is a thicker pizza, so I may be able to fit a few additional pizzas in there. 

In my research, deck ovens seem to be the most popular in the New York scene, but they also serve different types of pizzas styles like thin NY style. My boss has warned me that these ovens potentially have cold spots which can be an issue for an even bake. 

I feel like brick oven is out of the question. Beyond the price of these ovens, they seem to be much hotter than what we want, also with the cold spot issue. 

Another obscure option I found was the rotating deck pizza oven. Multiple layers that rotate the stones and pizzas, which I would think would be a more even bake.

&amp;#x200B;

So any thoughts on all of this? What oven style do you think would work best for a Grandma Style Pizza?  ",extraredpepperplease,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14eumg0/commercial_oven_for_grandma_style_pizza/,1687313924.0,0.76
"Might be ignorant here but never seen white fluffy stuff on snow crab before… For some reason I can’t post an image, but I picked up some snow crab legs earlier now that prices have come down, and was excited to cook some Peruvian food for my family, but when I saw the underside of the legs it made me pause. 

For background, I live 2 miles from the coast and owned a catering company for 8 years, so I know my seafood. I’ve never seen this before.

The clusters have the normal black bumps (I won’t name them in case of upsetting any tummies) on the shells, and one knuckle is torn and has darkened meat-what I assumed was normal “bluing”, but there’s also some sort of mossy looking growth on the knuckle and legs which is more fibrous (like I said, sorta mossy) than waxy as if the fat had extruded when it was cooked. Not firmly attached to the shell as if it were a barnacle and no marks if scraped off. Just stuck on there. 
Anybody know what this is and whether it’s safe to use the meat? I’m a big fan of not having food poisoning but also hate throwing away food.

When we adjust the attachments height exactly as shown in the manual ( nearly touching the bottom of the bowl ) for the 5L then when we change to the 3,5L I can't even close the tilting mechanishm because the beater is already hitting the bottom of the bowl before the mixer could close.

It is maybe a silly question but is this normal or my mixer bowl is faulty somehow?

Or it is the same for every stand mixer coming in a 2 bowl pack.

"NEXT STEPS FOR ASKCULINARY As many of you are aware, as part of the site-wide protests we closed the sub for the past few days and then reopened to ask you, our community, what you think we should do. The votes were pretty evenly split so we have taken the subreddit off of Private, but it remains 'Restricted' at this time. This means that no submissions or comments can be made. We know people still have questions, so we'll be addressing some of them here: 

**What's going on?** Last month, reddit announced changes to their API which impacts certain third-party apps which provide critical mod tools, especially on mobile.  We recommend [the recent coverage in the New York Times for a broader look](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/reddit-subreddit-blackout-protest.html). 

**How long will we stay Restricted?** We don't have a specific end-date - reopening is intertwined with several factors that includes: what response, if any, we see from reddit; internal discussions by the mod team about how we, as individuals, are feeling about things, evaluation of the changes that are happening, how they will impact our modding, and how we can adapt to deal with them in a way which allows us to continue to moderate the sub to our standards.

**Why are you Restricted? Why not just stay private?** While we went entirely private for two days as part of the reddit-wide blackout, many of the blackout participants are in favor of a longer period of protest, and so are we.   But since is a community and not a mod playground, we opted to ""put it to a vote"" with all of you.  It was a very close result, but the ""keep protesting"" votes were the winner and we believe that reopening in ´Restricted' mode is a nice balance. It still puts pressure on the Admins by signaling our position, but also allows us to reach a much bigger audience by having this and our previous statements more easily accessible, amplifying the message to more users. In addition, it opens up our archives for users to read past answers, but prevents new questions from being asked, which we feel highlights some of what is being lost when we are unable to run the sub.

**What Happens Next?** We don't know what the final results will look like, nor can we make any promises beyond the fact that we will continue to act and be guided in our decisions by what we believe is best for the community. We will continue our internal discussions and evaluations, and provide periodic updates to the community as we deem appropriate. We dearly hope circumstances will allow us to reopen fully very soon.

**Can I get access to the subreddit?** While we have moved the subreddit off of Private, it remains Restricted. In practical terms, only Approved Users can post in a Restricted subreddit, and Approved Users are limited to Mods. We understand that many of you have burning questions to ask, and recognize how frustrating it can be when you are searching for an answer, but we are not making exceptions. We hope that we will be able to unlock soon and you'll be able to ask your question in due course.

**Will you be going somewhere else?** We have no intentions at this time to pack things up. While reddits mod tools are very imperfect, reddit does provide a unique and unparalleled platform for our community to intersect with many others, both big and small, and all unique and vibrant. There is nowhere else on the internet like reddit. It is where we want to be, and why we want to be able to have constructive engagement with the Admins. We don't believe this is the death of reddit, nor do we believe this is the death of AskCulinary on reddit. So we're aiming to still be right here.",AutoModerator,272,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/14auew4/next_steps_for_askculinary/,1686915056.0,0.82
"The future of the sub **The Blackout**

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced a policy change that will kill essentially every third-party Reddit client now operating, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/)\- leaving only Reddit's official mobile app as a usable option - an app widely regarded as poor quality, not handicap-accessible, and very difficult to moderate a subreddit with.

In response, nearly nine thousand subreddits made their outrage clear: we blacked out huge portions of Reddit, [making](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-protest-why-are-thousands-subreddits-going-dark-2023-06-12/) national [news](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-06-12/subreddits-go-dark-as-users-protest-reddits-new-developer-fees) many, [many](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/12/reddit-blackout-begins/) times [over](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/reddit-subreddit-blackout-protest.html). in the process. [What we want](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh2te/what_we_want/) is crystal clear.

**Reddits Current Stance** 

Reddit *has* budged-microscopically. The announcement that moderator access to the 'Pushshift' data-archiving tool would be restored was welcome. But our core concerns [still](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145l7wp/todays_ama_with_spez_did_nothing_to_alleviate/) aren't [satisfied](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/147cksa/why_the_blackouts_happening_from_the_beginning/); Reddit has been silent since it began, and [internal memos indicate that they think they can wait us out.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759559/reddit-internal-memo-api-pricing-changes-steve-huffman)

This is where you, the readers of /r/AskCulinary come in to play.  We realize that reddit is more then just us moderators and we depend on our community engagement to make this sub what it has become.  So, we're leaving it in your hands.  Do we stay dark indefinitely until Reddit makes concessions?  Do we do a partial blackout - open the sub up for Read Only until Reddit make concessions?  Or do we give in and just make the best of the situation? 

**TL;DNR:**

Should we keep the sub private, open it up as read only, or go back to the way it was?

"What are your thoughts on clarifying butter in a jar in the microwave and just poking a hole to drain the milk? My brother made clarified butter in like 2 minutes active time. I feel this can’t be right, thoughts?

he took 2lbs of butter, stuffed it in a mason jar. Put it in the microwave for 1 minute then took it out and put it in the refrigerator. Once it got hard all the milk was at the bottom. He “drilled” a hole in it and drained the milk out.

I have a feeling this is wrong somehow, but why?

"How to create manjar blanco (as opposed to dulce de leche)? My friend is from Peru and one of his favourite things is traditional manjar blanco. Now manjar blanco and dulce de leche are often used interchangeably, but the product he describes is actually quite different from typical dulce. What he remembers is something that is both thicker/firmer and significantly whiter in colour and he said that his family would rarely make it, because it was too tedious (unlike dulce de leche), so they instead often got store-bought, where it would come in a wooden box. I've tried creating something like it for him, but it wasn't a success and I'm not entirely sure how to approach this. It's definitely not the product you get by just boiling sweetened condensed milk in the can for hours. Another thing is that he is lactose intolerant, so whatever way I end up making it needs to take that into account.

"Pie crust methods I've a question on pie crusts. Today, I came across a [recipe video](https://youtu.be/gvhz6UWrjNQ) by a lovely old English chef. He teaches us to make pie crusts using the ""hot water"" method, mixing lard/vegetable fat (btw can anyone advise on a substitute for these), butter and hot water.

I'm curious as to the science behind this, because I've always been taught that flaky pie crusts must use cold cold butter and flour. 

Also curious about how different the texture would be. 

Btw, not bashing either method. Just a curious student willing to learn. This gentleman's method seems far more straightforward than finicky cold butter and flour imo.

Expert advice welcome!

Edit: thanks for all the tips! I'm running errands right now so I'll be right back to look at each on carefully. Very grateful.

"Croissant Layer Questions I have a pretty lengthy question about the number of folds in making croissants. 

Note that I used this calculator for the number of layers in the discussion below: https://observablehq.com/@mourner/laminated-dough-calculator

I have made croissants many times, experimenting with the amount of folds. I generally follow Claire Saffitz's recipe and it has turned out very well but I've varied the types of folds I've been doing.

In most of the croissant recipes I've seen (including Claire), they enclose the butter block (so its dough-butter-dough), then a book fold and then letter fold. When I do this I get extremely defined layers after baking but they seem thick to me. I calculated this would be 25 layers (13 dough and 12 butter layers). I'm able to count each individual layer in the croissant I made and it lines up. However each layer seems thicker than ideal. 

A picture of the kind of thick layers I get are like in this example I saw online: 

https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/530e4e29e4b0ac922f793833/1431686387471-8EZQMPUOT0UQ5YVX3T0Y/au-levain-du-marais-croissant-side.jpg?format=2500w

In my other croissant bakes, I have had much more success with enclosing butter block --&gt; two book folds. I've also had success with enclosing butter block  --&gt; two book folds and a letter fold (which would be 97 layers).  I felt like I got better texture with more folds than all the recipes I see online.

I was reading a traditional French croissant is 55 layers - why are most recipes online less layers than this?

Am I calculating incorrectly or misinterpreting the recipes? Is it just my personal preference? Thank you in advance for the advice!

Fri - cook filling.

Sun - reheat and serve.

The wrench is that I'm in NYC and unsure if the fair is happening this weekend because of the air quality. Should I cook the filling and plan to freeze if it gets cancelled? The organizers are saying they'll decide on Saturday morning. 

The filling usually has hard-boiled eggs mixed in, should I skip them for this batch in case I need to freeze?

"Having trouble thickening sauces lately Posting on mobile, sorry. And posting with the technique question flair because it’s happening to multiple sauces. 

PLEASE help! I’ve never had this problem before. I’ve been waiting for my sauce to thicken way longer than needing to, and even then, it’s still watery. I’ve been resorting to sprinkling flour into it, which I really prefer not to do because I’m afraid of the flour clumping. 

It’s happened with a Homemade Cream of Mushroom Chicken, Pork Chops in Lemon Caper Sauce, peppercorn sauce, and Chicken with Shallots in Mustard Sauce. The last one is my favorite recipe and it used to turn out perfect. Adding the recipe for it below as an example of my problem. 

Ingredients:

8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
12 to 15 whole medium shallots, peeled
2 cups white wine
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tarragon sprigs
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:

1. Pat the chicken thighs very dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the flour, salt and pepper over the chicken.
2. Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet set over medium-high heat. When the butter foams, cook the chicken, in batches if necessary, until well browned and crisp on all sides. Set aside.
3. Add the whole shallots to the pot and sauté them in the butter and chicken fat until they begin to soften and caramelize, about 10 to 12 minutes. Add the wine to deglaze the pot, stir with a large spoon, then add the mustard and tarragon, then the chicken thighs. Cover the pot, turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
4. Remove the lid, and allow the sauce to reduce and thicken, 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Add the cherry tomatoes to the pot, stir lightly to combine and serve immediately.",angelexzarro,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1430zjm/having_trouble_thickening_sauces_lately/,1686105455.0,0.84

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf ""and everything that goes with it!"").

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord- but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",skahunter831,1490,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/141vodr/raskculinary_is_joining_the_blackout_on_june/,1686007052.0,0.96
"Searching for Culinary Institute of America Banana Bread Recipe Hi friends, 

When I was in college, I had a CIA cookbook that I scored at a used bookstore. All the recipes were huge because they were intended for feeding massive groups of people; I had to do the math to get a reasonable size recipe for a single household. The banana bread recipe was *amazing*. I recall that it was sweetened with honey. I think it also may have possibly had walnuts and shaved dark chocolate, but I'm less sure about those ingredients.

Fast forward to today. The cookbook has been sadly lost to the sands of time (I have no idea what happened to it. Did my ex take it? Who knows), and my google searches have not been fruitful. Does anyone have this recipe? I have four bananas that are ready to be devoted to the cause.

"Method to remove fluid from vegetables? Efficient way to remove water from vegetables?

Specifically, I’m speaking of an ingredient very common in Indian cooking, the snake guard. 

There are many ways to prepare it, including cooking it with its normal water content. 

However, some of my favorite preparations involved squeezing lots of the water out. 

The fluid in this has a certain bitter taste to it, which can be good in moderation, but does overpower the underlying delicious taste of snake guard, which is more subtle. 

This is why just cooking the water out like for most veggies doesn’t work. 

Traditionally, snake guard is sliced very thin, salted, and then squeezed by hand in fistfuls.  But to be honest, it takes a lot of hand strength to get out enough fluid.    It is a very firm vegetable that hangs on to its water. 

Can anyone think of a better way to remove the fluid of this in its raw state, before cooking?",augustrem,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/142w9uu/method_to_remove_fluid_from_vegetables/,1686092595.0,0.66

"Vegan Cheesecake Won’t Set Hi everyone!

I’m making a vegan cheesecake for a friends birthday. For the cake itself, I used about 40% Violife cream cheese and 60% coconut cream and about 0.6:1 powdered sugar to filling. 

I wasn’t as attentive as I should have been and the filling split while I was mixing. I assumed I could fix it like a non-vegan cheesecake and gently heated the filling until it was smooth again. 

However, now it’s been in the fridge for a solid 10 hours and still hasn’t set. Should I just toss it into the freezer and call it an ice cream cake?

Thanks for the help!

"Online it says holding a sweet potato between 135-170°F makes it sweeter due to amylase enzymes converting starches to sugars, but I haven't noticed a difference in sweetness. Am I doing something wrong? I read that holding a sweet potato in the 135-170°F range makes it sweeter due to amylase activity - although the temp range seemed to vary slightly from source to source. I also read conflicting info about the temperature at which beta-amylase denatures (some sites said ~160°F while other sites said ~149°F).

I've tried holding potatoes at a 150°F internal temp and then finishing at a higher temp to soften the flesh, but didn't notice any difference in sweetness compared to setting it at a higher temp to begin with and baking for an hour or so (finishing at about 210°F internal).

I've tried with foil, without foil, using the same potato cut in half (and trying different methods with each half), using two different potatoes, different time/temp combos, holding it in the ""sweet spot"" temp range, and baking without holding.

Am I doing something incorrectly? Is holding at 150°F too high since one online source said beta-amylase denatures at ~149°F? Is it possible that once it hits the ideal temp range for amylase activity, the starch-to-sugar conversion occurs very quickly, so holding it in the range for a longer amount of time doesn't do anything?

"Can i get some advice to improve my red and green salsa please? Mine taste good, but the restaurants have an amazing, flavorful salsa. The red salsa taste far more tomato-ey. My red salsa initially used real Roma tomatoes. Even tried salting to reduce water which was a lot of trouble for unnoticeable results. However, the water content seemed to dilute the overall flavor which made me switch to canned tomatoes in order to get a more concentrated tomato flavor with less water. This has improved the flavor, but it is still missing something that most restaurants do to make theirs so flavorful. 

My green salsa was nothing like the restaurants, which a friend told me was because restaurants add avocado or something else. Mine just basically switched out red tomatoes for tomatillos.

It was great, and I didn't notice anything particularly interesting about it. But, having the last piece today, the cake tastes distinctly of mint. 

Can any flavor chemists tell me why that would be? The cake is a pretty normal chocolate cake: flour, white sugar, oil, eggs, regular (not dutch-process) cocoa, brewed coffee, and buttermilk. The frosting was made with butter, powdered sugar, and milk chocolate, a Lindt bar purchased the day before, which did not taste minty when we ate some.

"marinade with oil or with water ? I was having a debate with a very traditional granny that has AMAZING FOOD, she says that if you're making a simple marinade for meat (not salads), it should always be with water not oil. Her argument being that oil forms a film over the meat and doesn't allow the spices to ""penentrate"" it, while water would make for a liquidy solution that's absorbed by the meat.

I should also note that we were having this conversation about a national dish that is basically a stew and it cooks like 6h+.

As an example, if I insert half an inch into a burger, it might say 120°, but if I insert it further, it will then read 140 or 150.  This does not seem to have to do with the inside being cooler than the outside as it is the exact opposite issue.

"My caramel tastes like Alpebliebe toffee, is this what caramel is supposed to taste like? 
Hello .
I’m one of the few people on this planet who don’t know genuine caramel taste. One of my first contacts with caramel was in the super adulterated Dairy Milk Caramello- caramel filled chocolate.

Since then I’ve dreamt of recreating it at home and especially so now as it’s unavailable everywhere.
So the recipe I followed for my caramel was:
About 100ml fresh cream 25% fat
1 and 1/4 cup sugar 
Pink of salt 
1/4 cup water
1/2 tsp vanilla essence 
About 25-40gram butter

I don’t own a food scale so the butter was eye measured…

I poured the cream once I saw the amber colour and the butter.

Fast forward to tasting time,it tastes like alpenliebe toffee. Not like the caramel I enjoyed in dairy milk silk.

This is my first time making caramel and I have no idea how it’s supposed to taste like . Please guide me for google and YouTube are useless after so much research.

Edit: next day, that is, today, I did another recipe
1/2cup sugar
1/4 cup cream 30% fat 
1/3 tsp vanilla 
1-2table spoon butter
Pinch of salt

This time I poured the cream when the sugar had turned a very slight yellow,first I added the butter then the cream.Well the taste hasn’t really changed, it’s way too sweet but still has that malty flavour.

Did not follow conversion chart, same result but about ½ inch of water.

Went for 2 minutes longer than recommended, let sit for 3 minutes, fluffed, same result.

Literally the only time it's ever worked was when I cooked it, fluffed it, and then forgot about it for about 15 minutes. But at that point, why wouldn't I just use my normal stove top way? 

Is it because I'm in Denver, at 5200 ft of elevation? Is it my microwave not being as good as it says it's supposed to be on the label? Is this device just complete bullshit and I fell for some guerilla marketing? Was an entire Reddit thread making a joke that I didn't get?

I’m very much a “measure it out” person, but they’re a lot more confident in the kitchen than I am and have way more experience, so with the pastes and stuff I know it’s at least the smaller number because they wrote down measurements for those. They did all the prep work and I just threw everything in the pot in the order they told me to. 

I heated up the pot and once it was hot I threw the mushrooms in. There wasn’t any oil or anything, just mushrooms. I cooked them at around medium heat until they started releasing liquid, then I pulled them out and put them in a bowl.

I put in two tablespoons of olive oil and let that warm up a little bit, and then the celery and carrots and spice mix. I stirred it around a few times and then put the lid on it for a minute, maybe minute and a half, and put in the ginger paste, basil paste, and garlic paste. Then I got overwhelmed because they had pulled out cilantro paste and jalapeño paste and hadn’t given me measurements, so they came over and added those as well as more of the other pastes and lemon juice. There was quite a bit of lemon juice. Maybe 1/4c. I stirred it all around and by that point the celery was starting to get translucent like they wanted it to. I put the mushrooms back in. 

I threw in three cups of broth and started stirring it all up while scraping the bottom of the pot to get all the bits off the bottom. The broth was supposed to hiss a lot when I put it in but it didn’t hiss or spit up at me at all so I think I put it in too soon. I mixed it up really good and waited for it to bubble a little bit before adding the rest of the broth. It was at least a gallon and four quarts because that’s how much the pitchers were but there was another bottle of broth that we added and I’m not sure how much it held. 

I let it heat up more and added the pasta and let that sit for about seven minutes with the lid on for the pasta to cook almost all the way. Then I put the chicken, collard greens, mustard greens, and horseradish mustard in, stirred it, and let it cook for two more minutes with the lid on until the pasta was done.

It was really good that first day, definitely a little bitter, but still really good. That was Wednesday. Thursday it was more bitter and that’s when my stomach started acting up. It hasn’t been touched since today (Saturday). I’ve been scooping the greens out because I think that’s contributing. They got thrown in raw, and spouse said they should’ve blanched them before putting them in.

Is there anyway I can fix this so this big ass pot of soup isn’t completely forfeit?

"Couple Mayonnaise Questions I succeeded at making sunflower oil mayo due to tips from this community, so thanks for that.

Yesterday I made a mayo with 1/2 C sunflower oil, 1/2 C extra virgin olive oil, 1T mustard, 1T red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp lemon juice + 1 whole egg

It split on me, so then I fixed it by slowly adding the split emulsion into about 1T of extra mustard.  I literally used an eyedropper and a whisk to make sure it wouldn't split again.

My result is fairly runny... but definitely not split.  So my questions are:

1. Is this runny texture due to the mix of oils, additional mustard, or some other factor?
2. Is there any noticeable texture difference from using different oils?  I love the thick consistency of the pure sunflower oil.
3. Does temperature affect the tendency for the emulsion to happen?  Eg, would the egg being at room temp vs out of the fridge make a difference?  Would slightly warming the oil beforehand do anything?

"How to thicken homemade nut butters, sans carbs Hi all, I did a brief search on related posts prior to writing this, please link if I missed something.

I'm making homemade nut butters for backpacking trips. My first batch last week was 50/50 raw macadamia &amp; pecan, with cacao powder &amp; shredded dehydrated coconut added. Very tasty but a bit looser than I'm aiming for even after it was chilled for a few days. Very simple process, just add the nuts to a processor &amp; spin. Ideally I want it as smooth as possible so I'd rather not leave it chunky for the sake of viscosity.

I want to thicken the end result so it holds firm even when not refridgerated, however **I am currently on a strict low low carb diet** so I cannot use something like corn starch or straight up flour.

I have used xanthan gum for sauces but I find that while the consistency is nice when it is fresh, the sauce becomes gooey and slightly stringy after cooling, so I don't want to risk this (unless someone has a proven method to share).

Many resources online talk about how to thicken store bought PB by skimming the fat off the top when it's separated. My last batch did not separate like this, and I have been eating it from the top carefully but it doesn't seem to break (IMO a good thing!) or lead to a thicker product at the bottom of the jar .

My next batch will be 75/25 macadamia to pecan for tweaking flavor preference, but otherwise I'm not planning any other changes.

Any suggestions? Thanks!

"Korean seafood bibimbap Hello,

I’m new to Korean cooking… I tried this dish in Florida, USA  (at Joen in Orlando) and I can’t get it out of my head…. Nor can I get a comparable where I live (I’ve looked!) It’s driving me crazy because I crave it all the time.  I’ve tried making it a few times… it tastes great but not Korean style. I don’t feel as if I’m getting closer with each attempt. I don’t have enough opportunities to cook Korean food in my household due to dietary concerns of family members nor do I know any Korean people to guide me on my quest. So here I am asking  Reddit members so that when I have the opportunity to make it , I make it properly.

For reference it’s a dolsot Bibimbap served in a stone pot but on the menu it’s listed as : “Seafood Hotpot Spicy. Stir fry shrimp, mussel, squid and vegetables on top of the rice.” It comes served with sides.

Today I tried making it with a Seafood Hotpot base packet (Lee Kum Kee) . I followed the instructions for measuring the water. I added a  red soybean paste (Doenjang paste?) and gochujang paste. I added fish sauce, mirin, fresh ginger and garlic, bacon, oyster mushrooms, sliced onion, fresh green chilli, red chilli flakes (not gochugaru)  and sliced carrot. It turned out more like a stew and not a bibimbap. I made the crunchy rice as the name suggests dolsot. And of course a seafood medley was added. I finished with sesame oil and Buldak sauce.  I feel as if adding the bacon and carrots were errors and likely won’t add them next time. I’ll try to find gochugaru for my next attempt if it is imperative for this dish. 

I need help. How should I make this? I can’t fly to florida all the time for this dish. But I crave it constantly.  It’s number 10 on Joen’s menu in Orlando, FL. 
 
Please help!

Sincerely,

Hungry for Seafood Dolsot Bimimbap",Rhythmkaurbass,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/13wcwn0/korean_seafood_bibimbap/,1685509413.0,0.82
"Leftover lemon curd I made lemon curd for lemon tarts, but could only fit about half of the curd into the actual tarts. I’m sure I can just straight eat the curd, but if I make more tarts shells tomorrow can I refrigerate the curd and cook it in the new tart shells tomorrow?

I made the lemon tarts from America’s test kitchen cooking for two. I doubled both the tart shell recipe and the lemon tart recipe (which uses the shells), but I guess my 4in tart cups aren’t as deep as the cookbooks because they couldn’t hold all of the curd. 

The curd was made using 6 egg yolks, 2 whole eggs, 2/3rds cup sugar, pinch of salt, 1/2 cup lemon juice, 2 Tbsps lemon zest, and 4 Tbsp unsalted butter. Melted and stirred until it reached 170F. Then strained and added 2 Tbsp of heavy cream.

"Effects of over-fermentation on sourdough? What does over-fermentation do to sourdough, or any bread dough?

I'm asking because of an ongoing problem I'm having with my sourdough pizza dough. After kneading the dough seems good - soft and elastic. I follow a recipe that instructs to leave it to proof for 16-18 hours (it's 380g flour/250 water/30 starter). The dough usually triples in size - it gets very big and airy. when I make the pizzas it breaks easily and has lost a lot of elasticity. it also feels clammy and sticky. The finished pizza is not good - hard and kind of crunchy. The crusts don't puff up in a satisfying way. I'm thinking it might be over-fermenting? Does this ruin dough? 

(I make sourdough bread, baguettes, and other types of bread with success. it's only the pizza that's goes wrong and I can't work it out.)

"Can you use Dream Whip with a Whipping Siphon? I've been looking up recipes on making a close to authentic Butterbeer from the wizarding world land in Universal Studios. The recipe on the website called for using Dream Whip and Marshmallow fluff since the ingredients for the Marshmallow topping used in the park was a non-dairy product. 

I saw that they made the topping using an immersion blender, but it did not specify whether the whipping siphon was a viable option. I was interested to see if a siphon would work after seeing cocktail foams being implemented in drinks, and I want to see if this was possible, or would it end up clogging the siphon?

The Recipe is as follows with the immersion blender.

1 1/3 cups water  
1 cup marshmallow creme  
1 envelope Dream Whip Whipped Topping Mix  
2 tablespoons powdered sugar  
1/8 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon butter flavoring  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1/4 teaspoon caramel extract or flavoring

&amp;#x200B;

* Combine the marshmallow creme with the water in a medium bowl and microwave it on high for 30 seconds. If you don't want to use the microwave, use warm water from your tap.
*  Stir until the marshmallow creme dissolves, then cool uncovered in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until cold.
* Add the Dream Whip to the bowl and mix with an immersion hand blender for about 30 seconds. If you don't have a hand blender you can use an electric mixer, but only mix for about 15 seconds.
* Add the powdered sugar and salt and mix for another 30 seconds.
* Add the butter, vanilla and caramel flavorings and mix just until combined. Store covered in your refrigerator until needed.
* Use the blender to mix the foam for 5 seconds or until some large bubbles form in the topping.

"Will my baking steel destroy my oven over time? I just bought a 3/8"" x 15"" x 20"" piece of a36 steel that I plan on cleaning up to use as a baking/pizza steel.

The first thing I noticed is this thing is heavy. I knew it would be heavy as I did research about it, but it still caught me off guard. I weighed it at 31.2lbs. 

I tested placing it in my oven and it was bending my rack a bit. So I put in two racks and a tray that can bridge the gap between them so the steel is effectively resting on both racks. The bending is less but still there. I am unsure about how long I can leave it like that and if it will permanently bend the racks, especially after being heated and cooled. 

I'm wondering if this will damage the racks over time or maybe even crash down at some point. If anyone has any experience with this and could offer some tips, I'm all ears!


Extra info:

Oven model: Frigidaire professional series cpes389cc2 (I cant find the manual for it, its a really old model ~2003 I believe)

Has 4 racks. Rack size is about 13"" x 21.5"". However it can support up to 15"" width providing I place the steel on top a baking tray to avoid the lip at the back of the racks.

"Smoking Pasta Absolute, undeniable cooking noob here. 

I wanted to get creative (even if it was a disaster) and cook some pasta al dente, then smoke/partially dry the pasta in a metal culindar in the smoker for about 4 minutes on a low temp.

My thinking is, if I dry it slightly I'm sealing in that smokey flavor and making it possible to cook Mac and cheese slightly longer in the smoker afterwards, thus being able to add even more smoke before the pasta starts falling apart.

I have a dish smoking now at 400°f. I assume it will at least be comparable to non smoked iterations but is there any chance there's something to my logic on smoking the pasta al dente briefly.

I seriously have little idea what I'm doing besides my knowledge of chemistry that doesn't involve food so any professional advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am just having fun. This might be garbage. It's how I enjoy spending my sunday's so please keep the comments civil.

Edit: To clarify, I'm really asking about the chemistry of a wet al dente noodle under dry heat. Does it (based on purely my guess without culinary knowledge) do anything to seal the noodle? Maybe to keep the sauce from melding with it? Has anyone tried this whether it be a smoker or an oven _drying_ it out prior to integrating into the dish?

Edit 2: Guys, this is amazing. Oh my gosh. For anyone who actually knows what they are doing (unlike myself) I would absolutely love to know your thoughts. The noodles didn't meld with the cheese, exactly how I hoped but maintained a smokey flavor throughout. Based on comments this is a weird thing to do....fair.

But before you judge me,. Try it yourself. Cook pasta just shy of al dente, then to a smoker, then to a dish.

In fact I cooked some chicken drumsticks sous vide, I collected the juices (fat and jelly) and stored it in two containers to perform the following experiment:

\- One container stayed in the fridge

\- One container was put in the freezer for 2 days (the jelly turned from brown to white)

\- I thawed the frozen container and compared it to the container in the fridge

The thawed container's jelly has a little bit of liquid, but it still has a strong gelatinous consistency. I would have expected jelly not to reform. Why is that? Could we store jelly in the freezer to extend its shelf life?

Today I will try to boil and then cool down the thawed container, to see if jelly will form again.",servermeta_net,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/13tw50v/why_i_can_freeze_and_thaw_my_jelly/,1685266355.0,0.7

"I'm wanting to do an experiment with applesauce and have a couple questions. I'm interested in making an applesauce but boiling the apples with tea in the water.

"Cubed beef steaks always tough, what am I doing wrong? We raise cattle and butcher our own meat, so we always have a ton of cubed beef steaks and I am so tired of them. I’m generally a good cook, can do a roast to perfection, but gosh darn it, these cubed steaks will be the death of me. I have tried slow cooking, pan frying, air frying, baking, grilling! Nothing I do seems to help it not turn into a piece of leather that I can’t eat. I end up soaking bread in the gravy (which is always delicious) rather than eat the meat. What am I doing wrong?

"Can't get crust on an a5 wagyu steak without overcooking it The stores near me only sell 0.5"" a5 Wagyu steaks. Here's my setup:

- Cast iron pan preheated to 425 in oven for 20 mins before placing on medium-high on stove
- Dry brined a5 wagyu strip loin / new york strip at room temperature

Because the steak is so thin, if I pull the steak at 120 degrees (allowing for +10/15 degrees of carry over cooking), the crust is not developed at all.

If I wait for the crust to develop better, the 0.5"" steak rises above 140 or 145.

Is there something I'm missing here? Does the pan have to be upwards of 500 or even 600 degrees or something?

Or should I try a different approach like sous vide, let cool, then butane torch?",NuckinFerd,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/13tnlcs/cant_get_crust_on_an_a5_wagyu_steak_without/,1685236107.0,0.74

"Is there a name for Cacio e Pepe with garlic? This is basically how I make any pasta that isn’t a tomato sauce. It’s a delicious bastardization of both aglio e olio and Cacio e pepe. I learned how to make each dish first, but then realized that they are just so much better together. What I’m wondering is if there is an “official” name for this dish. I know I’m not the first to do this, but a quick google search yielded no results, and I don’t want to piss of any Nonne by calling it one or the other.
