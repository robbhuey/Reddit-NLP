"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

"How the heck are bum ass dudes getting gfs? So I’ve seen a lot of posts about how women are tired of their bfs because the bf either doesn’t work or help around the house. I’ve seen posts about how they’re all man babies and add little value to the relationship. 

My question is, how are thee men getting gfs and why the fuck are the women just staying with them?!

Like are they all 100/10 ig models? Do all these men have insane personalities that make women fall madly in love with them?

"I(22m) have been seeing This girl(19f)for a few weeks now. I think she wants me to be her boyfriend. She's a virgin and 'desperately' wants to have sex, but I'm conflicted. 

We have been going on dates (5 in total) since last the last week of june. I think so far so good in terms of the time we've spent together overall. 

But last Saturday. I showed her my apartment for the first time. We shared a few bottles of wine. I played my guitar riff for her. All seemed normal. 

Then she asks if I want to have sex with her. Like just like that. Quite randomly and brazenly. She seemed a bit drunk so I laughed nervously. Obviously she told me she was a virgin in one of the early dates so It kinda shocked me how casually she was talking about sex given she's a virgin. Also I didn't want to sleep with someone who was very likey drunk too. Doesn't seem right.

So I  just keep playing my guitar and she starts semi taking her dress on and off. Danceing with a combustion of laughter. Honestly it felt so uncomfortable. You laugh yourself to hide the awkmoment. 

She then starts cuddleing me on the sofa I was sat on(with my guitar🎸). She then shortly falls asleep on my left shoulder. 

I then decide to go to sleep. Except I decide to pick her up. Put her in my bed while I sleep on the sofa. Out of respect I suppose. 

We then wake up we talk for a while about random things going on in the world. I tell her how funny was she was last night and she just laughs and before she leaves tells me 'we need to hangout more' and I should 'come to hers and meet her parents' I tell her I'd be open to that. 

Then literally just before she leaves my apartment door.  She says jokingly or in jest says 'her bed is big enough for us to fuck'. 

I'm just so so headfucked by her. Does this mean she sees me as a boyfriend by how she acting and talking(about seeing her parents)? I've never knew a girl like this. 

And is OK for Me to have sex with her given she doesn't seem the most mentally stable at times. I wouldn't want to hurt her little sweet soul in any way.",Formal-Crab-181,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c5hjc/i22m_have_been_seeing_this_girl19ffor_a_few_weeks/,1690569569.0,0.89

"Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place? I’m confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don’t do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I’ve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I’m confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Is she really just looking for a place to stay and this is something friends do? Is there a chance something romantic could happen when she visits?",jbsIV,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c85r4/why_would_a_girl_that_rejected_me_ask_to_stay_at/,1690575877.0,0.93

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that? I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

"My boyfriend (20M) has a low sex drive. I (19F) have an incredibly high sex drive. What do I do? My boyfriend and I have been together almost two years. My boyfriend could go two weeks without sex just fine. I could have sex every day. We are doing it once maybe twice a week. While it’s still frequent, I want to be having more. We used to have sex everyday sometimes twice a day. Now i’m lucky if I get any. He just doesn’t seem interested in having sex. I’m oftentimes initiating it. I have talked to him numerous times about wanting more sex and for him to be more interested in it. He says he will try harder and he does for maybe a week or two. I understand stress and just life in general can cause a low sex drive. Not to mention how long we’ve been together, I know sex can become more infrequent with longer relationships. I’m just at a lost of what to do. I love him so much. But I feel my needs aren’t being met. I’ve been open about what I want. I feel like nothing is really changing. I need advice on what to do.

"have you ever been with someone you don't find physically attractive ? i've never been in a relationship but i figure physical attraction should play an important part since that's the first thing you see in someone.  
  
i'm interested in knowing what other people think about this.  
  
I've already had a crush on someone i found unattractive at first, but we were talking by messages so it made it easier to get past the physical appearance and knowing them as a person through doing group work.  
  
But i wasn't as into them as the others where i also liked their physical appearance so i don't think it would have been possible. Especially since one thing i noticed is how much he was trying to compensate for being below average looking. And finally i had more hang-ups abt his clingy/needy energy than his looks...it's the lack of confidence that also a HUGE turn off.

"Correct me if I'm wrong On Relationships and Truth

We were sitting in the office canteen just chit chatting when I overheard someone saying do you know they're in a relationship and the conversation went on as follows,
Oh really ? For how long?
Last two years dude, started in the third year at the college fest 
Let's see how long they stick to each other 
-- why do you say so...?
Because I heard he is seeing another girl..she is in his team

I casually turned to see , they were a bunch of freshers enjoying the gossip
I started thinking why people think 'relationship ' as physical relationship between opposite gender?
Don't we have relation with our parents, children,spouse,friends, neighbours , colleagues?
The current generation or generation z as we call them have become so casual about relationships.
It's very important that we realize that superficial does not last long
We should maintain a certain level of respect for all relationship

"What is the lowest age a 29 or 30 y/o woman should date? I (29F) met a guy at a Mets game yesterday. We had a flirty conversation, but it was only a few minutes as I had to go.

He was with a friend when I met him, and they told me they live about 10 minutes outside of Hoboken in the suburbs. This makes me wonder if he and his friend are college students home for the summer staying with their parents, or recent college grads living with their parents.

"When I put ""looking for relationship"" on dating apps I have different experiences. Opinions? I'm curious Hello! this is a throwaway account but anyway, I'm looking for opinions and experiences to understand a phenomena. I would like to see men and women points. I'm completely aware that what I'm sharing has my personal biases and also my ego manifesting.

To give you some context, I have no issues ""getting"" women offline, mostly on bars and clubs, but online things are a bit different. Offline usually I hook up with younger attractive women (let's say  (15,10) years younger than me) that are able to give me an immediate validation as a man either by sticking around or sometimes having sex right away.  Online I tend do attract some good looking women, usually closer to my age (I would say on average 5 years younger) and with most things happen in a pace I can feel the woman really desires me. Feeling desired as a man it is really important to me.

I'm actually looking for a relationship and realistically I would prefer a woman closer to my age, so  most of my real dating (not hookup) prospects come from dating apps.

The problem is that whenever I put that I'm looking for a relationship on apps, and this is not something I always do, I tend to attract some women that I think are a good fit but I often have the impression they treat me differently.

I started to realize that some of them, because they know I want a relationship, they change their behavior in order to look more ""relationship material"" (I hate social stereotypes but they still exist) and at the end they fail completely to fulfill my need to feel desired as a man by taking the physical things really slow. To me it looks like they are either more interested in the idea of a relationship than being with me or they are purposefully withholding sex to make me to invest even more but I can tell from conversations this is not their default sexual behavior (example: usually they sleep with a man much faster but now they want to take things slow) which I think it is very manipulative.

I'm thinking now that I can't just put ""looking for a relationship"" because whenever I do this thing will eventually happen. I happened to me to be in a relationship, much younger, that after a while I realized I was not truly desired but an emotional support only and I would not like to be in this situation again. 

I understand that dating should have no comparisons but many men assess women's genuine interest based on how (fast) physical things happen. I know many women might say when they really like a guy they want to make sure the connection is real but what many men hear is simply: ""this other guy is worth of sex without commitment but you are not"". And to clarify, I'm not comparing 1 date with 3 (small difference with many contributing factors to why things happened differently) but rather 2-3 months of difference in time where there were many dating opportunities and time to get physical.

My final conclusion is that is is better, in my case, to always start dating interactions saying ""I don't want anything serious"", because then I see the woman true behavior, and let it build from there.

Yes and I know men, even though a woman might say she wants something serious, they can still lead her on to get sex, which is a bad behavior. I'm not playing a hypocrite here but I'm curious about what men have to say. Women feel free to share thoughts as well.

"Desperately needing to get out of a dating/relationship rut. HELP! Hey everyone,

Just fyi, I’m new to reddit and this is my first post. I am a 26M and have been in a dry spell with women for about 5 years now. I have never been on a date before and have only had 3 sexual encounters which were all not very good. I isolated myself all throughout high school and college (I did have some internet and videogame issues at the time which I have thankfully overcome) and never put myself out there. I did have some friends, but I isolated myself way too much. I also never used social media at all, and I realize how much that has hurt me. 

However, I have definitely turned some things around the past year or so. Im currently working at a hospital and will be applying to grad schools to become a Physician Assistant in April ‘24. That being said, I refuse to waste any more of my life living without dating and sexual relationships. It just feels weird that I have barely had any experience at all. I don’t even consider myself an ugly person at all, but my game around women sucks and I feel awkward at times. I’ve even had women be interested in me in the past, but was too insecure to take advantage of the opportunity. Time has flown by so fast, and I can’t afford to waste anymore time living like this. What are some ways I can talk to girls without just sounding so generic, I just don’t feel like I have a lot of interesting things to say. Also, what are good ways I can initiate conversations with girls. I need to gain more confident, but I don’t wanna come off as too aggressive.

I want to finally enjoy my life and actually have experiences with other women until it’s too late. This is a top priority in my life right now and any advice would be appreciated. Please help!

"I (27f) can’t tell if my partner (33m) is love bombing me or is actually into me 
TLDR; 3 month relationship, not sure if this is moving too fast, jump down to examples for context

I have been talking with therapists and they seem to agree that I have an anxious avoidant attachment style that I’m actively working on healing and was told it may take at least a year being with someone to actually feel safe in a relationship. One of my therapist and I talked today about insecure vs. secure attachment and I brought up love bombing and how I have had relationships in the past that were heavy love bombing in the beginning and very intense but tumultuous and short lived (ended around the 2 month mark every-time).

I’m currently in a newer relationship after my last one that was 4 years. We are just coming up on 3 months with a month and a half of dates/talking prior to making this exclusive. My partner (33m) is very sweet. He is kind and attentive, honest, and also honors my “no’s” and gives space when needed. We send a few texts during the day to just check in but see each other every weekend and our communication and comprehension is amazing. He has also told me he goes by a motto that if he’s going to spoil himself then he wants to spoil his partner as well. Honestly I have never been treated in a more loving way, even when we have disagreements- I love it but it feels scary to me because history has always started out feeling good before the mask falls down when I finally get settled into the relationship. 

My therapist sent me a link I requested to a website on what exactly love bombing is and I’m confused on what is appropriate at this point.

Examples:

-prior to us being exclusive when going on dates he did insist on paying for a lot of the dates but didn’t argue when I said I wanted to pay or split the bill

-conversations did not start out emotional/deep but slowly got deeper as time went on

-prior to exclusivity he got me a t-shirt and handmade glass cup I said I liked when we were out on a date. He had offered to get me more but I told him no, that was too much. He gave no push back.

Since the exclusive talk: 

-he has got me a dress, 2 handmade bracelets, and cleared my smaller wishlist on a cheap clothing site I’ve been using as I’m losing weight 

-my car got broken into at his apartment complex and he called out of work to spend the day with me to make sure I was okay and got home okay after talking with the police

-my car was also towed from his apartment another time because I parked in the wrong spot due to no available parking in visitors and he insisted he cover the bill for me

-he sent me money to order out food for us to have a dishes free date night and told me whatever was left I could keep. I told him no I didn’t feel comfortable with that and instead got us dinner with the money then used it to buy him groceries since he works 2 jobs 6am-10pm Monday-Friday and doesn’t have time or energy to go to the store. He never had food at his place so I stocked him up. He told me to keep the remaining for gas, time, and effort

-we do say “I love you” to one another already. The first time it was even brought up- we were drinking and talking about our past selves- he had indirectly said it (said he felt very strongly and gave me a look) and I said I didn’t want to say it yet because it felt too early but I understood what he was saying, a week later we were getting off the phone and he said it by accident and apologized but we have started saying it more often and open

-we FaceTime to sleep every night for the last month

-my mom and sister came to town and I told him we were going to go see a movie he and I had talked about seeing together but mom hadn’t purchased the tickets yet and he got them for us as well as got himself one. I had said I thought it was too early to meet parents but it actually went really good for a movie day (he just said hello and chatted here and there before parting ways right after). It impressed my mom and sister for sure. I have not met his yet and told him I do not want to meet them until around 8 months, he agrees this is a good idea 

-he tells me at least once a week how great he thinks I am and how much he admires me and goes into detail every time 

-he doesn’t try to control me/what I wear except on 2 occasions where I was going out in a short romper and the angle he was sitting at let him see too much leg/butt- he said it was fine after he realized it was longer than what he saw at that angle and the other day when I was wearing a sports bra and shorts while FaceTiming him and I guess too much cleavage was showing and I was going to step out on my balcony to bring my cat in

I feel like he’s a keeper. It feels good and easy being with him, and I don’t feel weird about any of it until I start comparing or reading into it which is Normal I guess as I deal with anxiety. But I don’t know if it’s all appropriate at this early stage. And I also don’t want to self sabotage.",ThrowRA_ifeelsilly,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ccf69/i_27f_cant_tell_if_my_partner_33m_is_love_bombing/,1690586282.0,1.0
"Good looking and in shape but a loner will I ever find someone? Hey, so I'm a 31 male from England. I get alot of female attention in public but I'm an introvert so I don't approach women.

I try to connect with girls online but it's clear when you view my profile I am not popular and don't have friends. I feel like I've come to the realisation that no matter how good looking or in shape I am no girl I want will ever want me because I don't have friends or am popular. I'm also confident and went on solo holiday to tenerife last week so it's not that, I can make conversation fine I will just not randomly walk up to girl to get rejected 99% of time and hear ""I have a bf"" as its soul destroying. 

Basically I just can't fucking understand why these things are so important to the good looking women I want. Everything seems to revolve around what other women will think and its pathetic.

My questions is, are there attractive women in this world who will take a chance on the good looking loner or does that just happen in the movies? Do attractive introverted girls exist or is that also in the movies.

"Weird situation with ex and family (18M)(18F) So my ex and I broke up a year ago (18M) (18F). (Disclaimer those ages aren’t correct, it’s just to pass the bot). It was a pretty easy breakup, not much to it, although it was entirely out of the blue. We were friends for about a year prior (high school). She blocked me on everything and apparently hates me now. I’m not sure why, we haven’t even talked since before the breakup. But, supposedly, someone told her a bunch of fake rumors about me, and she absolutely ate them up. However, they’re all extremely far fetched and the complete opposite of my personality and things that I would do. 

But she continuously takes little shots at me. For example at parties she’s made comments at me when she walks past. One example being when I was helping my friend who wasn’t doing great to a couch and she said “maybe you should sit down too” (I was completely fine if you know what I mean). 

At the start of the school year I heard from a mutual friend that she wanted me to ask her to homecoming which I said no to, as I assumed it was a joke and also just didn’t feel like it. She has also called me once or twice through the year as using the unknown caller thing (I heard her voice in the background).Her friends snap me pictures of her continuously every few weeks. 

I find this all very weird. I don’t have any problem with her. To be honest, I’d have said that I have a positive opinion on her until I saw her shit talking me on a friends phone, despite us breaking up a whole year ago, and her being the one to do it. 

Now my question is how to deal with this. The obvious answer is to ignore her, which is I’ve done for the past year. However, our families are good friends and my parents continually tell me I should try to fix things, even just saying hi to her. Her parents also really like me and supposedly want us to be friends as well but that’s just what I’ve heard. And I don’t think her parents know about whatever this drama is. 

The more important part is that we have mutual friends which makes it awkward, mainly on her part, when we’re around each other. We’re likely going to have a lot of classes together next year, how do I deal with this? What’s the best way to go? 

There’s a lot of details that I left out, so feel free to ask if something doesn’t make sense or whatever.

"my boyfriend has a fetish for old people and its worrying so my bf (22) and i f(20) having been dating for almost a year now he’s honestly my best friend end and i really dont want to break up with him but this is so concerning. when we first starting talking we were talking about what are turn ons where and he said old people and i was extremely confused i didn’t know if he just meant old people make him happy because he works in a nursing/Retirement home  but he said he thinks wrinkles are attractive and it took me a while to be okay with that and I’m still not really its quite strange. he works 5 days a week there sometimes i go and see him at his work and he obviously dresses them and things and i just think its weird because i think he is sexualising them i Asked him and he says he doesn’t think of them that way but he clearly does he always suggests watching porn to have sex too and at first is was just normal but now its just got progressively worse its just all old people now and it completely puts me off its really gross. He always buys me clothes and its obviously old people clothes and gets mad when i dont wear them. theres a lovely old woman called angelina (fake name) shes 72 and she really likes him hes been working there since he was 16 and her family never visits so hes grown quote close with her and he always brushes her hair and buys her loads of things and he took her hairbrush home and goes absolutely mental when i touch it and takes it everywhere with him and it’s absolutely berserk. when he gets home from work hell call her andd talk to her for hours then go on the bathroom for about  1-2 hours everyday after work and then never wants to have sex but hell have sex with me on the weekend when he doesnt work i dont want to assume things but I think he’s touching himself to her or thinking about her while doing it I’m not sure and I just feel like either something is going on with oth them. it was her birthday and he literally spent nearly all of his wage on birthday presents for her and when it was my birthday he barely spent £50 which is fine but why would you spend almost 1500 on an old woman And it’s just strange like he has things to pay and he’s spending his whole months wage woman and not on necessities.
He says they are just friends I don’t know I don’t know what to do i love him but i think its too weird

"I'm (27F) Torn (40M)&amp;(30M) I dropped dating apps for this very reason, and yet it happens again... 2 great men fall into my circle at the same time.

I went on a date with P(40M) two weeks after my very toxic relationship ended. When he asked me out I was very honest and let him know what I went through, and that I wasn't ready for a serious or commited relationship. He wanted to try the date anyway, and it turns out, we got along really well. So we decided to keep seeing each other for fun.

2 months in, and he seems really serious now. Mentioned moving in... being against kids, but would have them if it was with me... I realize now we've gone too deep, despite my constant reminders that I'm not ready to be seriously involved.

In the meantime, about 1.5 months ago, I met M(30M) through a volleyball group. He was shy at first, so I didn't notice his interest, but now it's obvious. And honestly, I'd really like to date him too, just to get to know if he's a good partner or not. He does, however, belong to a religion that doesn't accept Atheists, and I know this will likely cause problems with his family.

I know I will have to have a conversation with P about this, and I plan on being fully transparent and honest. However, 1. He knows M, and 2. I could see P being a good life partner for me. I just haven't had time to get to know either well enough, but I feel P is so far along that it would seriously hurt him to hear this.

I'm not getting younger, and have never had a healthy or good relationship before P. I want to have children and be around for their grandkids, so it just ups the pressure to find the right partner right away. I don't want to lose the chance to be with either of them, but I know it's not right to not make a decision.

I know people who find themselves in these situations tend to be judged really harshly. It should be easy to just comit to one right away, right? I just wish it didn't have to be this way, and I just hope the right partner will be the person I chose in the end...

"As a real Demisexual..... Dating apps are completely useless After a lot of therapy and working on myself and pointedly waiting to start trying to date again after my divorce. Dateing apps are completely useless. 

It's so weird for me. I am not attracted to physical features at all. If anything pictures are a complete turn off. I want to know what your dreams are, what your goals and aspirations are. Who is your favorite person, where do you want to be when you grow old. 

I find that, literally all men in the dating apps that I sometimes match with, are all looking for just that one thing. Don't get me wrong. When I finally grow attracted to someone I turn into a succubus that only can think about one thing. However if I am not attracted to you, it's like you have zero sexual identity on my radar. 

I use to be able to force myself to do casual encounters, but those were not anything fulfilling or memorable in the slightest. Now I just can't. The idea of casual anything makes me want to throw up.

Does anyone have any pointers on how to go about dating as a self aware and healing Demisexual? Borderline Asexual?

"Girl I was dating friend zoned me, but still follows me. Should I unfollow? I was dating a girl I met on insta for 4-5 weeks, we went on 4 dates and kissed on the 4th date (I know it was late) and we’d speak daily on text. We arranged to meet again for a 5th date, but after agreeing she started to give me slow replies. I could feel she was pulling back and on the day of the supposed 5th date I asked if she was still coming and she messaged saying she thinks she sees me as more of a friend, she really enjoyed our time but didn’t see it progressing to anything more. 

I ignored the message and went on with my life. But I’ll be honest, I really liked her and saw things moving in the right direction. We both said we were only dating each other at the time. This was 10 days ago where she cut things off. 

We still follow each other on Instagram, but I will have moments throughout the day where I will think of her. I want to unfollow her (not block) but a part of me wants to keep her there in case as we did really get on.

The really big issue is that he is also been seeing someone else 26F, and I known about her when we were friends. Hes been seeing her on and off for years, and He isn't exclusive to her either. They keep going through up and down periods and when we were just friends i kept advising him to break things when he told me all the bad but he just wont do it. She pretty much thinks of him as a boyfriend but he doesn't see her that way.  
Now he's seeing us at the same time and it hurts that he was at her place last night (saw though her insta stories) and not with me. I feel lost and so alone. And while he was at her house part of the time he was texting me.

I am DRAINED. I have zero motivation to even try with anything anymore. I’m just going to narrow my mindset and tell myself I’m content with being by myself (even though, deep down I’m not). I’m 30 next month. Part of me just wants to leave everything behind and join the peacecorps or something.

"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

"Trouble after long term relationship My partner of three and half years recently left me. I thought she was the one. We have lived together for about three years and I can honestly say I’ve never loved someone like I love her. We shared finances and we were planning our future together. We were getting ready to move to a new city and everything. I was even looking to propose rather soon. I’m glad I didn’t in hindsight as that would have made things more complicated.

Things didn’t end with resentment or nastiness but I am still devastated to say the least. We still love each other but she feels that she needs to take the next chapter in her life alone so she can figure some things out. I still have trouble processing this some days and other days I feel like I can see the silver lining.

My previous relationships before her were long term as well. I don’t think I’m ready for anything serious but I think if I were to get back out there and start talking to other people it might help me heal and cope with the loss and major life change. My only issue is that I honestly don’t even know where to begin. 

I’ve heard horror stories about dating apps but I’ve been considering downloading something to at least meet new people. I just don’t know which would be best for my situation. I’m not ready for anything serious at all. I want to ease into it. Not necessarily looking for hookups but I’d be open to it if I get to know someone well enough and the vibes are right.

All advice is much appreciated. Is this even a good idea? I’ve been feeling so lost lately and I need to be proactive and stop wallowing away in self pity.

"How can i meet women and, most importantly, interest them ? Hi. I'm 25 and lonely. Physically i'm average, the real problem is that i'm awkard and kinda boring to talk to 

The thing is, i'm not a chatty guy, at least with people i don't know well. Back in school/collegue it took me several months each year before i spoke to classmates regularly. I improved a bit since then, but not by much. I can make some small talk to begin a conv, but people just get bored eventually. I just don't know how to make conversation or make myself interesting. I spend most of the time listening to others. How can i even meet and interest a woman in those conditions ? I feel like i'll go nowhere if i continue like this, but also that my attemps to change course are futile. 

Right now, i have a remote work job, so i stay home most of the time, and a dwindling social circle from old friends. 

I just went to a vacation where you're supposed to meet people (and hook up are common), and i can make small talk during meal just fine. But it stopped there, i haven't made friends. I don't drink and i don't have fun in the night-club setting, which i feel is a strong negative in those settings. I don't think it's just a case of ""you'll get used to it"", because i've been on similar vacations 3 times and to night clubs like 10 times: i wanted to force the change, but it refuses to come. On this point i'm not pitying myself i just think it's not for me.


Hobby wise, i go to the gym regularly and take drawing class. Also there, i can make small talk with strangers just fine, but that's about it. I started salsa class recently (but so far it's the same story). 
I also tried cold approach a handful of times, and it stayed consistently akward, i made precisely 0 progress in hours, i'm not getting better at it. But when i can't make normal conv to begin with, this was expected, so i'm not surprise or sad about that. You can guess how well i did with dating apps... 

To put the nail in the coffin, everytime i tried asking out or on date a girl i got rejected, like 7 or 8 times (+ during the cold attemps). I know those number aren't really high, but everytime i try it's a kick to my associal ass.

I'd like to have at least 2-3 Girlfriends before I turn 40, since I am actively trying to avoid the whole end up marrying your first partners that happen to a lot of late bloomers I have known or have observed happening through stories online.  And I don't want to only get one person to date.

I know a guy who is a chubbier dude who is now married and has an adopted kid and he met her back when we were both like in our early 20's. 

I do not want any kids, and I never want to be married despite thinking of becoming catholic since I believe in Birth control, Abortion and condoms. I'm not going to go into WHY I am so far behind because that would basically be a book and I wrote a post telling the whole thing before. but it does have to do with Chaotic living situations and taking care of dying and much more disabled than I family members.

There's certain types of people I will never date despite the fact I'm supposed to be obligated to date them, or society says you have to be willing to, I'd rather be alone in that case. I am not attracted to my own race and even if I were 99% of the people that have the most in common with me are from outside my racial background anyways, so I'd end up dating more of those people anyway.

 I don't like curvy women with large breasts and big butts like certain types of models, I like modestly sized, women. 

I started a tinder profile despite not having a flattering photo, swiped nope on single moms because I am not interested in any kind of kids or family, plus i want to avoid sex with a woman who has given birth, nobody should lose their virginity to that and I don't want to hang out with kids or have someone who has someone other than me as their first priority except their parents.

I also swiped nope on black women because as I sadid before I am just not turned on by women of my own race, and I also automatically swiped nope on curvy women because large body parts don't appeal to me. 

Sydney sweeney is pretty as an example but her boobs are just too long and saggy. Somehow I like Mila Azul although her boobs are round but not long and saggy or flapjacks which I find to be gross and I would not have sex with a girl with ugly breasts.

I personally have never had something last longer than a month where I felt it “wasn’t it” and I also never thought to sleep with someone if I didn’t know if I even liked them.

"Welp he finally told the truth I knew it but somehow I’m still devastated like I didn’t. Me and this guy started talking the beginning of this month. We had great conversations and were planning several dates. We had sex too soon and I can admit to this. It was great sex. But it was too soon. I hoped we could still continue to be cool with one another but he started to fall back. Texts got shorter his effort wasn’t there like mine. It got to the point that I was basically talking to my self and he was okay with it. I decided not to give up until he did. So everyday I tried talking to him. For a bit he played along. Last night I didn’t reach out anymore I was tired of feeling so rejected. That’s when he called me. We talked about a bunch of nothing but he kept hanging up telling me to hold on. Till finally he hung up told me to hold on then never ever called back. Today I reached out to see if I can get a response. I texted “dtf” what do u know suddenly he was great at responding and said ya he was down. I  pointed this out to him. I think it triggered him. Because he got kinda mad as if I was wasting his time and stopped responding to me afterwards. Few hours go by and I finally say one last thing “why”. He responds moments later “you’re not my type” 

It crushed me how he couldn’t keep it real all that time and let me embarrass myself for a week straight.

Now I have to heal all over again.

This made me feel even worse, like if I had imagined all that we had (maybe I was) but I don’t really know how to deal with this because I will keep seeing him at college, and I feel sad and jealous that he thinks that about my best friend and not about me.",PuzzleheadedAd8154,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cbq81/my_crush_likes_by_best_friend/,1690584555.0,1.0
"The difference between having a type and not. I want to start out this by saying I feel really conflicted and kind of guilty about this. And if I’m playing into some sort of gross race thing then I sincerely apologize. 

Ok, so when I (I’m a male) was younger me and my family went to a basketball game live at a stadium. And while we were watching the game there was this attractive woman sitting nearby, she was Asian and apparently my interest must have shown because ever since then, my family has done nothing but tease me about liking Asian girls.

It infuriates me, they think that just because I like things like anime I’m into ‘Japanese girls’ and stupid shit like that. I was raised to believe everyone has the right to be treated equally and fairly but something about the way they poked fun was….gross to me. And it made me feel gross about myself.

But now I’m starting to actually get into dating (I didn’t really in my teens and twenties because I wanted to be more focused on my education) and I kind of find myself preceding Asian women.

Now that’s not to say that I only find myself attracted to them! I’m guilty of finding women of all cultures attractive. But I just……I feel like I’m towing a moral line here, I mean obviously there’s nothing wrong with finding some attributes of someone attractive, but I don’t feel right about race being something that factors in. 

And there again, this is purely physical appearance, personality is the biggest thing that can decide what you feel about someone, but it’s just…..I don’t know, I feel like I’m treading some possibly bad water here and I want to know what I should do.",Goodhearted_Jake,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cbm6u/the_difference_between_having_a_type_and_not/,1690584270.0,1.0

"I'm about to confess my feelings tomorrow through a love letter, Please give your opinions! Things I should improve on! Also how to deal with the consequences 22:00; July 29~ the saddest/happiest day of my life.
Dear Anne, 
So, this is gonna be a long message. It'll be my SINCERE  request to go through it all 😊.   I still think it's too early to talk about this, especially when you're still in recovery process after the breakup, but I thought it'd be the perfect time to rewrite/replace a memory. 24th July was the anniversary which didn't go as you expected.. and today could be the day which you might be happy to remember for the rest of your life.🙂(just my silly idea yk, I tend to make dramatic memories, I adore memories)

You were curious to know who my crush is? 😅

From the first day of our conversation I had a gut feeling that you could be the one, and I was so sure of it before even seeing your face. Anne with an E brought us close, made us relate to each other more and I'm sure this is just the beginning of it and there'll be plenty of relatable memories. Also the fact that the connection between us have existed forever and discovered only recently, makes me think that maybe it isn't too early to talk about this. Maybe we've been neighbors in the galaxy forever and sequence of events brought us closer together. 

We both know what we've been looking for. The purest form of love which will never disappoint us, never make us regret, never make us cry a river, will be free from toxicity of human mind, will preveil beyond death, will let us sleep peacefully, will let us sail through the ocean of life smoothly... I've been waiting all along to find the right person to show up and with you it was an instant spark ✨

It's my one last chance at love.. my only way to resurrect love. I've never written an essay to someone like this. But this is going to be the last one, so I'm really thinking to present myself as neatly as possible before you, Anne. I'm too hesitant to call myself Gilbert Blythe, as I don't possess the charming look and personality he has. I maybe the ripoff version of Gilbert Blythe ordered from online 😭. But I want to love you the same way Gilbert loved Anne. I really wish I could send this as a letter though, could've been more perfect. 

About distance, I'll quote you here ""we all belong together"" ... It's only a matter of time that we could possibly meet. Though physically we are distanced but I'd love to close the distance as soon as possible. And I promise I'll present myself to you as the best version of myself..  

Now, share your dreams please! You think you're the only one with dreams of 30 cats and 19 goats?! Wrong, let's do this together! I don't wanna miss the chance to be with Anne in her dream ""Green Gables"" 🥺. We love the same things, we cherish the same things.. I'm the potential partner in crime, shoulder to cry, companion to trust. I wanna be a part of every dream that you wanna share with a partner. Not just that, I wanna relieve you of every nightmare you face. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, I'll always try to make it even better I promise. I would like to grow together with you, communicate with you, take care of you, travel to amazing places and discover the mystery of this world together!

An exclusive perk of being with me: You get a personal, free of charge, 24/7 on duty doctor at home. 😎 ( I promise I won't hurt you with needles, I'll be so gentle with it)

Now I don't even wanna stop writing because writing about you makes me excited. You're the dopamine surge in my brain. Talking to you never felt boring for a second. And after the face reveal, I was like awwwe.. my heart melted. You know me as a night owl, but I have  been awake only to talk to you dummy! 🥺. There's been several times I looked at your photo with teary eyes, scared, whispering to you ""please be mine""... so scared of being rejected by you. I am by no means worthy of your love, but your love is all my heart seeks for. Also scared of losing you to someone more perfect than myself.. 

Long story short, I present myself to you with an open heart, visible with all my strengths and weaknesses, my absolute feeling of compassion for you.. I am damn sure about my feelings, are you? You've been the most amazing addition in my life.. I'm rooting to make this permanent till death, even beyond death.

I love you Sarah(pseudoname)... 🥺. Will you be my Anne forever?

Sincerely your's

I was basically done for the day, all I had left to do was to hit the leg press machine. While I was in the middle of my workout this girl walked over and started up a conversation with me. This girl was about 5”5 and 195 or 200 lbs She eventually asked if she could get my number or instagram. I told her that I wasn’t down for that and in the most gentle way I could I said no.

She then asked why I said no, but I didn’t want to give her my real reason so I said that I just wasn’t interested in giving out my number or social. After that she got pretty aggressive and said that wasn’t a real  answer and continued asking why. I was going to get up and just leave but she got really rude. I eventually told her that it was because she was really overweight and I couldn’t date a girl like that . She then said I was  shaming her and that i was basically being fat phobic.

"Coworker Situation So there’s a girl that I work with. She started a few months ago. I noticed her pretty quickly, she had the kind of eyes you could get lost in if you’re not careful. She works in a completely different department than me, but I technically have a more senior position in the company. 

A couple of weeks ago she came into my office.  Needed to review a document. She positioned herself at the side of my desk and knelt over to show me specifics on the document. I was immediately aware that if I wanted to I could see straight down her dress, but I’m not an asshole. I maintained professionalism. Then she stood up as if to leave, repositioned herself *directly the fuck in front of me* and bent wayyy over to continue explaining the document. Again, didn’t even think twice about maintaining professionalism. 

Fast forward a few days, she stopped by my office for another work related thing and mentioned that she broke her toe. I said “oh no, that sucks” and she was like “yeah, look” and she took her shoe off to show me how it had bruised and monologued for quite a while about how it happened. I’m in no way one of those feet weirdos, but it just felt so intimate for a work setting and with such limited interaction between us. 

So that happens, and that’s when I was like “hey wait, what the fuck was that bending over my desk move? Was that on purpose?” To myself. 

The only other real interaction since then was when I had to call her for clarification and she answered the phone with “hey darling.” Which was a super weird superlative to use if you’re trying to drop a hint. 

So what do I do here? It seems entirely plausible that I’m completely misreading the situation, and I recognize the my own vulnerability in that I noticed her first. She’s definitely extremely outgoing, which is the opposite of me, so I might be mistaking common niceties and social mishaps for advancements and I’m not about to risk my professional reputation on a slim chance. 

For what it’s worth, we’re both mid 30s. She’s a little older and divorced. I’m just habitually single.

"How to best explain to my bf just how selfish he is as English is not my first language I’ve (29/f) been dating my boyfriend (27/m) for 8 months now and I have been seriously thinking of breaking up with him. However, I do need help on what to tell him which led me to want to do this.

For context, he’s my first boyfriend and the past few months have made me see things clearly and I do not like what I’m seeing right now.

Out of the fights that we had, the worst one was the one we had when we went on holiday to see my favorite band in a music festival. He bought the tix after we had a previous fight as his way of making it up to me while I booked the hotel. 
When we arrived at the event, he got uncomfortable with the amount of people and kept on asking if we could go out and come back later when my favorite band is playing. He kept on doing this until I got pissed off and we went out of the concert grounds. I explained to him that the moment we went out, we won’t be able to go back to that spot as it is not a reserved place and that every minute, more people are getting in. He knew it was a big event with and estimated 45,000-50,000 people.
In the end, I didn’t get to watch the band I love and he got upset because I got upset. 

Also, I spent almost 1k gbp for everything (food, hotels) during the entire holiday where I spent half of the time crying while he gets to enjoy and go to his favorite spots.

After 3 weeks, we had an honest talk, aired out what made each of us feel hurt before making up.

Now, he stayed in my house for three days and used up all of my towels, toiletries and groceries while refusing to drive me to work because he’s tired. I did all the cooking and cleaning while he was at my place.  

I can see now how selfish and a parasite this man is and I would like to ask for help on how to tell him how selfish he is to me as English is not my first language. I want him to understand and feel just how he used me in those instances. He previously phoned me saying all mean things to and one of which is I was using him but it’s not true.

I think we were both really into each other but I was so broken from bullying in high school and being backstabbed by people I thought were friends and had huge trust issues so I probably came off as not interested even though I was head over heels for her.

"Does this guy like me? There was this guy (unsure but looks around 20-22M) at my (19F) company that is really attractive, though I rarely see him other then on the hallways as we work in different divisions in a large corporation. I was very scared of talking to him because I have Autism and doesn’t want to come off as extremely awkward and ruin everything (I am horrible at talking to strangers and was just average looking myself). However, a few days ago, I saw him by chance eating at a restaurant, I sat next to him. I was confused about something on the menu and decided to ask him about it. I said “Excuse me” and he started looking at me, so I quickly looked down. But he was very nice, answered my question, and was laughing loudly the entire time while talking to me. I so badly wanted to talk to him again so I asked him how to open the pepper. And it happened, he started laughing (unsure of the type of laugh, but it sounded a bit nervous). When all my attempts failed, he leaned all the way across me to help me open (likely because the space is too tight and crowded to walk across). At the contact, I started blushing, not sure if he noticed, but he started laughing even louder. The last instance is when he’s leaving and accidentally dropped something, so he went to pick it up and at that moment our eyes met and he smiled and looked away.

So here’s the question. Why was he laughing? And do you think he likes me or at least have a positive opinion of me?

"Confusing stuff in my last year of college So I (24M) and in my final year of college (I started late due to military service), about to graduate in September actually. In a class during my final semester, I met A (21F) also on her last semester of college. We only started talking 7 weeks ago.

At first, it was casual, just friends in class talking. We eventually went out with some people in the class and after that I started to take an interest in her. I then asked her out for lunch, and it became a semi-regular thing which we would do every few days.

About 3 weeks ago, she went on a weekend trip to another city and asked to meet with me when she came back. Of course, I said yes and we met up at the train station where she came back from the trip. We ended up having a really nice dinner, took in nice views from an observatory, walked together for an hour, and just lost track of time. We missed the last train without even knowing it while we were at a park, just talking about life.

That night, we found a open field in a park to just lie on and talk, listen to music and enjoy each others' company. At one point, we were holding hands and saying how much we liked each other. We planned to head back once the first train came on, but we we continued just goofing around in the park 3 hours past the first train. I did eventually send her back to her place before heading back to mine. After that night we grew closer and closer with more frequent dates etc.

Recently her friends have been telling me to tell her how I feel etc etc and try to convince her to stay after graduation (she's not decided what she'll do after graduating, but she wants to apply for masters back in her home country in a program that will start next September). Another one of her friends even straight up told me that A likes me and told me to just go for it.

I myself, have been accepted into a masters program in the college I'm already about to graduate from, on a scholarship, so I'll definitely be staying here. I honestly don't mind doing long-distance as I've done so in the past and I know I am capable of doing well (the last long-term relationship I had was LDR and she ended up cheating on me when she got drunk and gave into temptation with a coworker she always found attractive blah blah).

This week, I've tried to ask A out for our regular lunches or just to meet up at a cafe, but she would always say she's busy etc. Even last time, when she was busy, she took the time to squeeze in 30min with me if she could, which I found to be really endearing and attractive. Furthermore, in the last weeks, we would text so much until 3am in the morning, but recently, she only texts very infrequently. I went to talk to a mutual friend about this, who's very close with A and she said that A likes me a lot, but the thing about distance is scaring her (Apparently the girls talk a LOT about guys they meet, who knew?). As a result, A has decided to distance herself from me, according to that friend, even though she has feelings.

I honestly don't know what to do because I respect her decision. If she doesn't want to start anything, nothing can be forced and life goes on. Just can't help but feel that this is right person, wrong timing, cuz I feel this could've developed into something special and long-term. It's the first time I'm in the scenario where my head and heart wants different things. Head is telling me if she wants to distance herself and not get into LDR, then don't force it on her. But heart wants to pursue it, even though my head says it won't be respectful to her decision of wanting to distance herself. I'm in a bind, can y'all give me any advice?

"Advice for Finding Someone as a Sober Introvert Hey folks, just gonna start by saying the default ""do more of what you like and you'll find someone"" advice isn't going to help here, cause what I like doing doesn't involve meeting new people (not that I hate meeting new people, my hobbies just don't encourage that).

For some context, I'm an introvert that recently started using dating apps to try to find someone cause I'm in a new city with no family nearby and I've been single for over 6 years, that makes life pretty lonely. I really hate using the dating apps because they make me feel judgy and wreck my self-esteem because I've not been having any success. I get likes pretty regularly, but they are almost exclusively from people I don't find attractive and on the few matches I do get the conversation goes nowhere and the one first date I went on went nowhere, no spark. I'm generally a pretty dry texter so I think I make pretty poor first impressions over text. I'm much more engaging in real life, so I need to find a way to use that.

I don't drink, so bars aren't an option, and I don't generally like going out to meet new people, but I know I have to if I want to start dating anyone. So my question is pretty simple, what can I start doing other than going to bars where asking someone out isn't frowned upon or weird? Again, the normal ""do what you like"" advice just doesn't make sense for me and I have no real hobbies that involve group interaction (with new people).

He can feel when there's a shift with me and he will ask questions about it but there is not really any solution offered. I enjoy spending time with him and feel my needs are met in person, apart I do not. This has been communicated to him before.

When someone you’re intimate with asks “are you ok?” At the right times , what conclusions can you draw from this?

Is it safe to assume they are capable of empathy? 

Is it safe to assume they really care?

Could these words be used to give the illusion of care and genuine compassion? 

If so is there any way to know ?

"Social Anxiety with Girls, should I go to the psychologist? Hi community,

I'd like to have some advice from you. I'm a 26M that never had a relationship or sexual experience in my life, I'm an average looking guy, 165cm, skinny, I work and study, traveled a lot, definitely not too boring but maybe not being interesting enough and/or not showing interest in the correct way.

&amp;#x200B;

I always got along well with women, have a few real friends and this is nice. However, I a-l-w-a-y-s failed when trying to show interest to women and since I moved to a new country (all by myself and alone) a few months ago, everything is being much harder. I basically don't have any woman friend, just a couple male friends. My goal at this moment is to get a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending several hours of my life during the past years just watching PUA's videos and reading articles, posts, advices in general but I can't put it in practice. Although I know that approaching a girl in the street can be so easy and have awesome results, I have kind of a ""blocker"" in my mind that literally doesn't make me take the action to do that. I start getting nervous/anxious in a very high level just by looking at an interesting girl.

As an example: I met a girl a few days ago, we had some nice convos in the first day but I felt myself too nervous and most likely I was looking too desperate that she didn't talk to me the same way during the following days...

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to consider going to a psychologist because I'm so sad and disappointed with me that I'm unable to approach a girl or have a conversation without being anxious and looking desperate to pick up her. What do you think? I know that practicing maybe is the only solution for my case but the problem is that I am unable to put it in practice because of my f\*\*king mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating apps are also bullshit for me, never get matches or the ones I get don't answer me (and no I'm not the kind of guy who say just ""hi"")

In brief, I have 3 big problems problems to solve before even starting a relationship:

\- Social anxiety with women I find interesting

\- Showing interest the right way without looking desperate

\- Be interesting for women

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't say bullshits like ""oh you're too young, don't worry"", first no I'm not too young and second everybody who says such thing was able to have at least one experience, no matter if it was bad or good

"Something happened and I feel like I don’t want to see her again. Am I being ridiculous? Hey! 

I’ve [M27] been dating this girl [F23] for almost two months now. I work full time in a hospital and because of university she only works part time at a bar but only like 2-3 days a weeks at most.

Anyway we had some issues but always talked about them. But at this point I’m sure she will say anything just so I don’t break up with her. But I think today something broke in me and I don’t feel so good about her anymore. 

I’ve been working for 2 weeks almost every day. 12 hour shifts and the only free time I had was the afternoon/evening after night shift sleep. On top of that I had very bad shifts, acute cases. We lost young patients and stuff like this sometimes wears you down. So yesterday I have a shift, I’m ending at 6 pm. We didn’t agree to see each other that day. She texts me out of blue she’s sleeping over at my place. So I’m like okay but I’ll be tired and I planned on just taking a shower, eating something and sleep but we can watch a movie. I just really need to chill out in bed. I explain to her how draining the last two weeks were on me and that I need to chill out. She’s a future nurse so I tell her how we had some very bad cases that got to me like kids with serious conditions. So she’s like cool we can do that together. Then she comes over and it takes like an hour so before she starts talking about how we should go out in town because there’s some event going on and we should go grab ice cream. I keep telling her that we agreed to go Saturday (the event goes on whole weekend) and that I just want to relax a bit tonight. But she keeps asking me to go out with her. So I tell her I would totally understand if she went or in the future if I say I need to relax and she doesn’t feel like doing that with me we can just meet the next day it’s not the end of the world. Anyway we stay home, watch movie, get a glass of wine etc. 

So next day which was today morning we talk about my schedule. I tell her we had lots of sick personnel but after Sunday my schedule is all great for August. But I will need Monday and Tuesday. Monday to clean up the apartment, sheets, clothes, floors, windows etc. and Tuesday just for me to do a bit of mental hygiene. But after that we already have plans for trips etc. of course she goes off at me, starts bringing up that I didn’t even go out with her last night. And this really got to me because I tried my best explain that I’m exhausted and I would understand if she didn’t come over and we’d meet the next day. 

On top of this she’s mad because my ex gf from like 3 years ago asked me for help. We remained friends but we’d only talk like once every 6 months over messages. She keeps losing memory for hours and fainting randomly. Doctors are giving her appointments in December and she can’t pay for earlier ones. So all I did was text her back saying ok I’ll try something. And talked to friend who’s a neurologist and will check her out. I explained to my gf that from experience I know this could even be a brain tumor and I’m not even talking to her about anything other than when she should visit the neurologist friend. But she’s mad about this and keeps bringing it up. And for me it just feels so cold. Like the girl could have something serious and she did help me when Ukraine war started. So why should I not return the favor at least. 

Anyway after all this she apologized over text saying she needs to get used to my schedule and how I work. 

But since then I felt kinda cold towards her. I really dread seeing her again. I don’t want to text her back.

"7 month with this girl of talking and telling eachother how we feel and say he has feelings and they are growing Well iv been friends with this girl for a while like 7 years M
25 and she F 24 so va she started this relationship I was just being her friend but I saw that I was getting feelings when we started to talk.
We told eachother how we felt and we both felt the same, both had feelings and wanted to see how it went. I invited her to 2 dates and both time it went great we both clicked. I would also go every month to her work place to drop off food and gifts just one day every month.
Recently I told her that I'm ready to move the relationship to be official and she said she had a lot on her mind and told me she need time to think before she make any decision because she doesn't want to do something she will regret later. I told her that she can take all the time she wants. So I slowed down my texting with her to give her time to think. I will still send her good morning snaps to show that I'm still here for her and she send them back and their personalized to me not like a S and that all.
I'm willing to wait. Told her sister BF what I should do and he said i should have a talk with her. So today I told her

"His boundaries are stricter than mine and he seems afraid to make progress At the beginning of the month I confessed my feelings to my crush (and friend of 2 years) and he returned the feelings. We’ve had a discussion laying out the milestones we want to meet together before considering anything serious (it’s long distance). I told him there’s no rush on anything and he agreed that we shouldn’t rush through it. 

So far it seems like I’ve been the one most responsible for sending messages and suggesting conversations and communication that serve to progress the relationship at what I believe is an appropriate pace. However, he’s giving me some signs that he feels uncomfortable taking the role of being the one to progress things while also showing that he wants to take things slower than I do. 

For example, I initiated a conversation about our boundaries around intimacy the other day and he seemed a little hesitant to speak up. At one point he asked if I was concerned about it hurting more if things between us fell apart and we had made things sexual. This is kind of concerning to me because I have been working on getting away from the mindset of worrying about how I’ll feel in the future about things I’m doing in the present because I think it prevents me from living in the moment and is even a little self-sabotaging. Personally, I think it’s unhealthy (at least for myself) to try and look out for my future self because I figure I’m going to be hurt either way if things have to end. And if they end before we’ve made things sexual, after we’ve made things sexual, before we get serious, after we get serious, etc. Then to me it doesn’t really matter because I’ll be hurt in that moment but I’ll never know what the hurt would have been like had we or had we not progressed to a certain point. But it concerns me that he’s already considering his emotions when things end rather than putting that focus on intentionally building our relationship, whatever that might look like for him at this time. 

Additionally I’ll make suggestions about things we can do to progress things (that are still baby steps!) and he seems very shy to accept or very gently rejects me. He’s also himself shared that he has a fear of rejection alongside his fears that I’ve noticed about progressing things between us, I feel kind of lost. I don’t mind being the one progressing things but at a certain point I feel weird about continuously suggesting things knowing that he’s wanting to move slower or that my suggestions still aren’t in line with his boundaries in that moment. I don’t mind the rejection but at a certain point it makes me uncomfortable to continue bringing up these conversations and suggestions all on my own. But if I stop what I’m doing now I’m concerned that he isn’t comfortable trying to progress things even when he might be ready, so things will just slow down and come to a standstill.

"Me (25f) and my boyfriend (27M) are having an issue in relation to anime girls and him looking at other woman, he doesn’t understand my side of the coin at all. How can I make him understand? So, me and my boyfriend have been dating for a solid three years. The main issue we are facing is in relation to anime women. I have informed him of my feelings towards any half naked girls, let alone cartoon character ones.  
  
Out of all of the mousepad options in the world, after having several discussions with me that I am the only one he wants, he hates seeing me sad and after he said he understands my concerns he decides to get one that has two half naked anime girls on it (meanwhile the guys on it are in full armour fully covered and the girls are in bikinis) , obviously these girls have unrealistic features I will never be able to attain, and it makes me severely self conscious.  
  
I have told him how self conscious it makes me (its not like I am fat or anything either, I work out and have a decent body) and how I don't appreciate that he disregarded my feelings and bought it anyway even though we have had so many discussion about my feelings and how I dont appreciate it. (which tbh I think is fair, a relationship should be about each other and only wanting to look at eachother I dont understand how men see it as a nonhurtful thing, to surround yourself with girls that your girlfirend will never be able to look like. Constantly putting me up to the standard of them, because that is who he wants on his mousepad.  
  
It always a huge fight and that I shouldn't be so ""dramatic"" because they aren't real. But these are my genuine concerns and feelings.  
  
Here is where it gets flipped around, I get shamed for talking to male coworker because he apparently has ""feelings or a crush on me"" but I think of him as a really great friend. He has never done or said anything sexual towards me, but I get shamed for talking to him. But get my feelings put down when he has a mat with two girls on it, when all the dude on it are fully closed and look badass. But the two girl characters on the show are wearing literally bikinis and the dude are wearing full armour.  
  
Bascially, I am not the type to seek revenge, always have been to kind and deer spirited to ever stand up for myself like this. but after years of being cheated on, and having anime chosen over me in the past damn straight I am going to voice and show the hypocrisy.  
  
I want to make him see how much he hurt me by getting that mousepad, and I really need some advice on how to deal with this. Why can't men just like one woman, I dont care if he has female friends, but his female friends arent half naked\~?

I would rather use the word 'flex' because she used to say that she has lots of other option than me. But there has not been a single time when I let her doubt about any girl's name on our fights.

I thought her ego would get washed out with time after sometime but today I realized I was totally wrong.

For the present context , I happened to saw a chat between my gf and one of her old guy , the guy wanting to marry my gf which was also my gf's relative but not by blood. The guy called her for the facetime and after my gf didn't reply, he texted 'kali'. That word means 'dark color skin girl' (with a sense of love). And after few calls here and there they facetimed for some few minutes back and forth.

The problem here isn't that my gf talked with that guy. Back in honeymoon phase of our relationship I once called her you are my 'kali' and she was offended so bad that we nearly broke up and she still sometime taunts me about that incident whenever we have fights. But now she is okay with someone else calling her that word.

Yeah stayed loyal the whole time, loved her to edge but now I am profoundly not okay about what has happened and I think I should breakup with her in a very brutal way that she will regret her whole life.

"Guy I have a Crush on doesn’t see me as an option 
Using a burner account as he knows my Reddit username 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m a 26 year old female  , I have a crush on my 24yr old neighbour. He might not have the looks but he’s  one of the most gentle, helpful and respectful person I know and my family also likes him a lot ,  but what frustrates me is he doesn’t want to date “ white woman “. He complains about not having a Girlfriend , he always rejects me if I offer to set him up with someone I know . He says he can’t date a woman who isnt’t Indian  . I don’t know what to do to get his attention or get him to change his dating preferences as “he’s not going anywhere with Indian woman” in his own words . I am average looking and maybe better with makeup and I don’t think my physique would be an issue cause I’m 5’3 and 135lbs. I tried to take interest in his interests and seems to have backfired cause he treats like his male friends.I can tell him that I’m interested in dating him but I fear I will loose him and him being around is very useful ( this is a bit selfish ) . Do you guys have any other suggestions because he’s talking about moving to another part of the city by next month as he got a promoted at his job .",Caramel_Muffin123,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15br82n/guy_i_have_a_crush_on_doesnt_see_me_as_an_option/,1690532012.0,0.69
"Is it really my fault am I the terrible person Me and my ex genuinely had a very toxic relationship he was controlling because he would say stuff like “ if you wanna post a picture you need to tag me on every slide” I generally didn’t know how wrong this was until now he told me it made him feel special. When he cheated on me he unfollowed every girl for me and uninstalled every social media app when I found out to show he changed keep in mind I never told him to do this he  did it to show he changed. 

Later on he told me “ you know when I unfollowed every girl I was expecting you to do the same yknow like unfollow every guy” by this I was utterly confused? Was he doing that to just gain control of me did he really mean it. He used to tell me stuff like “ if I can’t have you no one can so I might as well just kill you” and proceed to call it a joke. I used to find out some things about him like, he used to fetishize asian women I found old messages  of him doing it  and people calling him out saying how wrong it was as his response would be “ like I give a f*ck” by this I was utterly uncomfortable and confronted him about it I told him it made me uncomfortable he basically told me it was in the past it wasn’t a big deal etc. i went on with my day but I did find out weird stuff about him which I lost it.

 Me and him got into a silly dumb argument I thought everything was my fault out of guilt I told him “ I think we need to break up” and removed his highlights and everything from my bio when he woke up he was freaking out told me “ how dare you” I apologized to him and told him sorry and I didn’t wanna break up I just thought it was what he wanted he told me it wasn’t I’ll admit it like an idiot I took it back and told him how sorry I was and my overthinking thought he didn’t wanna be with me no more he then got mad told me it’s all my fault I broke promises etc. he told me “ well if you want me to forgive you you should do something similar like to me unfollowing every girl” to this I knew he wanted me to deactivate my account without even telling him I did in the past so I did it again. I made a new account where it’s only him. 

I apologized to him constantly I knew he was a controlling guy so I told him “ I’ll do anything josh! I will follow any rule you want me too just please take me back “ I fell asleep I woke up to him saying “ you know I don’t mind actually making you my slave for real and you obeying my orders because I owe you and your my property” I was quite disturbed by this but yet so blinded I told him I’m ok with it as long as he took me back he made me send you know private pics when we weren’t together and do certain videos and write his name on my thighs. He would tell me “ if you don’t follow my rules I’ll leave” etc he told me if I activated back  my account I’ll need to give him the password he told me it was My idea which I don’t remember saying. He gave me this thing called “progress” where I’ll have to do certain things to get it up so I can be with him again. We were having a normal conversation when out of nowhere he said “ do u think we should let go of each other” I said no and I don’t wanna give up he than had a random out lash and told me”  I’m  too much of a sensetive guy my heart is too pure for this generation “( I wish I was lying) he then said he is gonna focus on getting rich going to the gym etc and he told me he doesn’t think he are ever gonna get back together I was heartbroken I still tried to be there for him but he was being rude towards me and stuff he got all offended when I said “ I’m here to help you and This is what I get?” Shifted the blame on me and told me he told me that “ you knew I was gonna be rude to you if you were there for me I warned you” 

He was even more mad and told me he never asked me to come back to make the long  story short towards the end he told me “ I hope one day you realize you lost the boy who really loved you go for a guy who only wants you for one thing” I was very hurt by this statement this might sound very immature but I sent him screenshots of what my friends said about him and my brother than I just blocked him . Later on he contacted me on WhatsApp saying “ I can believe you told my brother I tried killing MYself! You told him my trauma?? And many others I can’t believe it I’m done with this bullshit” when I saw this I told him off and gave him a piece of my mind calling him a shitty person controlling told him his childhood isn’t an excuse to be a bad person etc he kept telling me to calm down but I wasn’t taking any chances and kept going he then said “ ok make sure you eat have a good day” and blocked me. I told my friend nick about the situation he knows I hurt I was nick got mad and told me to give him his username to tell him off I didn’t want too but somehow he managed to get it and he told him off cursing at him etc

 my ex told me to leave him alone multiple times but he told nick “ she blocked me I have her unblocked she can contact me anytime she needs help” I wasn’t planning to contact him again but that statement made me mad because it was a lie he had me unblocked I told him off saying how could you lie like that he told me well maybe instead of you insulting me calling me a narcissist and sneding me s screenshot of what your friends said  we would’ve fixed this he ranted about how much he hates himself and how much of a monster 

he is bc of one of the screenshots he told me he tried taking s bunch of pills and almost killd himself which I don’t know if that’s true wouldnt he be at the hospital ? And while driving he tried not to crash into a tree I felt awful and terrible and told him sorry and it’s all my fault his birthday was today and I sent him some stuff apologizing saying I was in the wrong etc my friend nick told me not to listen and he is just trying to manipulate me but I felt so bad and awful and wrote an apology to him he got mad and told me how dare I tell people about his trauma and how could I not defend his name when my friends were talking bad about me when he defended mine 

he told me I broke another promise because he wanted me to block this guy while we were dating and when he found out I unblocked him he got sad and said I  broke a promise by unblocking him even tho we are no longer together. He told me to leave him alone and he wants no one no friends no nothing and that me and my friends “won” I felt awful and left him alone.

"Guy checked up on my socials, ghosted after I messaged him Pretty much what the title says. I noticed a guy kept viewing my empty tik tok profile every few months, for around a year (I think longer?), although I didn’t recognize him at all. One day, after he’d viewed my profile twice in a week, I worked up the courage to message him and ask him who he was and why he was checking out my blank profile. He was a bit embarrassed, and admitted we’d talked on a dating app before (over a year ago), and I guess he remembered me from that. 

I didn’t really get why he was viewing my profile and not messaging me, but I thought it was a bit sweet that he recognized me, so we chatted for a bit. He seemed really sweet and earnest, and made comments about wanting to hang out after he got back from a trip, and told me he’d like to keep in touch while he’s gone. 

To my disappointment, he went on his trip and didn’t message me once, despite being online. Even after his trip was over, I heard nothing from him, so I deleted him. He didn’t owe me anything since we never dated. 

Now weeks after ghosting me, he’s viewing my profile AGAIN, and following me on my socials. I sent him a message, letting him know why I unfollowed him, and asking if he wants to talk. I waited a week and got not a single response from him. 

I guess I’m just looking for some insight? I’ve already deleted him since he’s clearly not taking me seriously, but why would a guy check up on me for MONTHS, but not actually communicate with me?

"To early for that? So I have been dating this girl we have been going for like 2 and half weeks, we had a few dates, we slept at my house a couple times and all in all we are having great fun and enjoying each other. The thing is I'm going to give some context about my self and her before asking. Since I started working and studying, and now just working I have pretty much left my ""crazy life"" behind, meaning I don't really have the energy to go out and party and being in a an environment full of people, I prefer to go with my close group of friends have a beer smoke one talk and chill. She on the other hand is quite a sociable person likes to party quite frequently at least 1/2 a week all in all that's not really a problem for me. Once I get to know and like someone I like to devote my attention to that person and I don't get romantically interested in anyone else, and I like someone that has the same mindset. The thing here is because she was way more of a sociable life I'm a bit insecure because I don't really know yet her intentions with us and if she is interested in being exclusive I would like to ask but I'm afraid that it's to early for that can someone help me with some advice?  
I can't really read people intentions it's hard for me so I don't know if we are just having fun and that's it or maybe it could be something more

"Am I the only one who thinks this stuff is stupid and hypocritical? Sorry I  personally think that guys need to stop acting like woman need to be these prudes that like hate sex until they get with them. Like woman will say a loot if things and sometimes mean the opposite but . Men have been pulling this On my way! For a while , you can’t want a girl who is sweet and has like no bodies but want her to be like trans trump in the bedroom that’s not how that works bro. And just the stigma that girls get for exploring their sexuality nowadays is just wow  if you make it do any type of sexual content your a lost cause and not wanted. If your a guy with like hella bodies your that guy tho shits so stupid. It’s even more wild to me that I see this sentiment from a lot of guys but then guys who think like that will turn around and hate on people like Kevin Samuels . Even Andre tate doesn’t think like that and he’s said some wild stuff. Not saying everyone’s the same but I think stigmatizing sex work in general nowadays especially for woman is just beyond stupid. Especially when some of these women do it for work or simply just like what they like . Idk I think it’s dumb also this isn’t all guys but I do think. This is how a lot of guys feel or maybe I’m.

"Should I date other men after a failed relationship? 
Hello everyone,

I (23F) have been broken up with a month ago, after a 3 months relationship. As it was my first ever relationship, and I had put a lot of value into « preserving » myself for the right person, I’ve been feeling heartbroken for the past weeks. I know, especially given some exterior circumstances, that we will never talk to each other again. I will have to see him in college in September, but we will definitely ignore each other, there is absolutely no doubt about that. 

Even though I did have feelings for him, I thus know it is over and I will never get back with him. So I feel like I can reasonably start to date other people, and I will make sure that those people will not get hurt emotionally. I’m a very loyal person, and this failed relationship has made me realize I need to share and receive love. I do grieve the person I was with, but what hurts me the most is to feel that with him gone, the possibility of love and companionship is gone too. Which shouldn’t be the case.

However, even though I do want to start dating, I just don’t know how to. The only time I’ve accepted to go on a date was with my ex, and it was extremely stressful to take the leap for me. I made so much efforts to make it work and to be available, and I fear I might be even colder now that I fear getting hurt.
I would happily welcome advice on how to take things lightly and to actually start a dating life. The only things I’m confident about right now are my appearance and mind, which is really good, but it’s so new for me that I’m scared nevertheless. And I don’t even know how to do it - for sure, there are those guys I randomly meet outside, but wouldn’t dating apps be a better way to get to know the person a little more and to select people who I’m actually interested in?

"am i did the right decision? i (F20) with my (M24) just broke up just a week ago. we were broken up in a good way. And i’m the one who’s decided to cut the relationship. but before that, let me tell you about my situation and how i feel during in the relationship with him. first of all, we never see each other yet. eventho he already set his date to come to my place and meet me. my place and his place are so far away. it takes about 5 or 6 hours. 

he’s fine, good guy and very hardworking people. and ofc he’s always busy and his time was too limited in a day. and i’m very understand that. at first he’s really good at managing his time. but these past few weeks.he’s changed. we rarely call each other only text. but after that, even text he can’t make it. it just “good morning” “i’m home” “i’m tired” and “i’m sorry”. only that. at first i can accept it. but day by days. i realised i felt hurt. so told him about how i feel. in hope, i can discuss about this with him. but in return, he keeps on saying that he’s a bad guys because make me feel like how i told him. it’s not only one time but a lot of times. everytime i want to discuss with him about these things. he always brags about he’s a bad guys. i hated that so much.

i feel like unwanted in this relationship. he always told me about how tired his life. but when it comes to me he always said that i cannot feel that ways. basically he’s not validated my feelings. i’m tired too. i have so much things to be done too. but now i’m fine a little bit. because i just finished my diploma. less burden. i told him i mentally tired and drained. he just said okay and pity you??? i want him to comfort me like how i’m comfort him when he is not okay.

not only that, i have like a big social group containing a lot of guys. we just friends and i only close to only 2 of them. and he felt jealous because of it. but him always told me about those girls whose love him before. i’m so annoyed with him, because he keeps telling me that those girls always chasing him but he doesn’t even like them. okay bro you don’t like stop telling me about it. start from there i never tell him about my days to him. but he don’t bother to asking me why i stop talking to him about my day.

he stopped wishing me good night before he went to sleep. eventho i already reminded him to texted me before he went to sleep. everyday. but still, he keeps saying sorry and forgot to text. 

i gaslight my own feelings to save the relationship but at the end. i can’t make it. it eats me up. i feel like burnt out because of it. so i decided to cut the relationship. i want to tell more but i’m tired to think about it. that’s it.
please tell me that i did the right decision because i felt like guilty and can’t stop thinking about it. thank you.

"I feel so weird going from being insecure to desirable within the dating scene I’m a 22 year old male, 6’0”, average/husky build, and a pretty average looking guy (at least to me). 

I’ve been insecure my whole life. No one ever told me I was ugly or made fun of my looks or anything, I’d just constantly compare myself to other guys and get in my head tbh. 

I’ve never been in a relationship because I always thought I was undesirable and feared “inevitable” rejection. I didn’t even lose my virginity until I turned 21 last year lol. My insecurities deprived me of so many experiences. 

I lost my virginity on my birthday vacation, and since then I’ve had a MAJOR boost in confidence. I started taking pictures more, been more outgoing, and just overall more confident in my skin, but not fully. 

I recently made a few dating app profiles, and my God, the amount of likes and matches I’ve gotten is insane. I’m talking 200+ likes within a 2 weeks and an average of 2-4 matches a day.

"Should i move on or move out? TLDR: my next door neighbour (M20) in my (F20) dorm dumped me in a very hurtful way because he for reasons I don’t understand wants to be with his ex girlfriend (F18). How can I forgive him? Should I try to become friends with him again or just move out?

I’m a college student and I live  in a dorm with 12 other people with whom I share a kitchen. We’re all pretty close, basically roomies. Over the summer me (F20) and the guy (M20) i live next to started hooking up/dating. We kept  it  a secret from the other people in our dorm. We’re both from the same town so it was pretty easy seeing each other when we were visiting our parents. When we hung out we would go thrifting, go to the beach and flower picking, stuff i thought was date - primarily because he also called it that. Over the summer he met a lot of my friends form home and I even let him sleep over at my parents house because I really thought we were seeing each other seriously. He even asked for us to be exclusive! A week ago I picked up on something, he was acting different and texting me less. I asked him about it but he told me he was just sick.  I accepted that. Also I  didn’t want to pry.  After that we didn’t see each other for a week ish. I was certain something was up so I told him I wanted to talk about something. We agreed to talk Monday evening. 

Then Monday afternoon I was texting him and he told me he was meeting his ex girlfriend (F18)  Then later, Monday evening when I get home, I text him again. I want to talk as we agreed to do. He opens my message but doesn’t reply. So after a while I text him again. He doesn’t reply to this one either. I can hear someone’s in his room. I’m pretty sure that’s the ex girlfriend. Some of the people from my dorm later tell me it’s her.  He continues to ignore my texts for a couple hours, when he replies he tells me we can talk when she’s gone home. It becomes really late and texts me saying we can talk tomorrow.  I am not pleased. So I go knocking on his door. I find out she’s still in there. However, he comes out to talk.  He’s crying and tells me he misses her. We agree to talk more tomorrow, as I feel kinda bad letting her sit alone in his room. He tells me they didn’t do anything sexually. 

The next day we talk. He tries to explain himself but keep changing his explanation. First he insists we were just FWB but later he says we were dating, he’s just not sure he could fall in love with me, although he thinks I’m sweet, intelligent, pretty and great in bed. I ask him if he’s in love with his ex. He tells me no, however he still wants to be with her. She doesn’t want to be with him. I don’t understand his decision but i respect it. 

We agreed to just be friends. I want us to be. However, later that night when we were watching a movie together in his room, he said that I could lay against him if I wanted to. I didn’t.  And I’m kinda mad he even asked. I feel so used. A part of me thinks that he still wants me. However, I know that it’s naive. I’ve drunk texted him a few times, asking him what’s wrong with me since he cannot fall in love. I know I’ve been too much with my messages. Normally I never do that. It’s like all my pride and self worth is completely gone. I feel so desperate and pathetic. He even told me not to text him about it anymore. I’ve not reached out to him since. He hasn’t reached out to me either, which makes me question if there’s even basis for a friendship when I have to take all the initiative. I think about him all the time, partly because I can hear him talking and moving around in his room from mine. 

My problem is that I cannot seem to forgive him or forget him, though I really want to. He pursued me. He asked me on a date. He allowed me to get attached to him. Then he betrayed me and tried to convince me we were just hooking up, making me feel like dirt. I feel like he’s messing with my head and it hurts so much. I  cannot stand being with him. I hate hanging out with the other people in my dorm when he’s there, I hate that i have to hide that I’m sad. My self esteem has never been lower. I really like the people in my dorm so that really sucks. However, I’m not happy living next to him. It’s very stressful for me. Therefore I’m considering moving. Should I do it if I cannot forgive him? I want to forgive him, how should I do it? Do you think we can ever be friends again?  I feel like it’s unfair I have to do all of the effort to forgive him when he’s the one who hurt me. I need advice.

"I expressed my needs to my BF and he felt overwhelmed I’ve (23F) been with my bf (25M) for 5 months. I have a good time every time we hang out together. He makes me very secure and safe. And what’s more, he is adorably funny, caring, and really affectionate. 

But I’m seeing patterns of issues and things that make me want to have conversations with him.So the past week we had several conversations about these:

\* How often we see each other: I always have to ask him to stay with me for 2 nights on weekends. He would prefer if he only stays for 1 night because he sleeps better on his bed. He mentioned that one time he stayed for 2 nights at my place he didn’t have a great Monday the next week, and he needed good rest because he has a demanding work schedule (he works overtime), which I totally understand but I get attached and would miss him a lot. To be clear we only see each other once during the week or none at all (I come over to his place during the week cuz I have more flexible schedules). And weekend is usually when we spend most time together. He felt overwhelmed. I mentioned that I want to see him once during the week and 2 nights on the weekend, which made him feel like, at this speed, we were gonna see each other every day. And that is too fast for him. But I never said I want us to see each other every day. I feel misunderstood.

\* Sex: I expressed that I don’t get very turned on if we jump right into sex. I need more time for foreplay like cuddling, teasing, and kissing. I also expressed that it would be nice if I can keep a vibrator at his place because that’s the only way I get off and I don’t want to carry it around every time I visit his place otherwise I wouldn’t be able to come. And he feels like I’m demanding a lot. He even said he felt like I was nitpicking but I really wasn’t. Sex is important to me and I’ve been finding it hard to enjoy it because of the way he rushes to things.

\* Deciding things for me: I expressed that I’d appreciate it if he asks my opinions first instead of deciding things for me. I want him to ask me “Hey we’re going to this bar, do you want to join us?” Instead of “We’re going to XX. I assumed you wouldn’t like it. So I decided for you that you won’t join us without even asking.”

He said it feels to him that I have been the one expressing needs. He has never done that aka scheduling a time to have this sort of conversations. I mean, I love how he almost always says yes to my invites/plans (for example he said yes to a last-minute concert I wanted to watch). But I feel wronged too. Because I can tell he isn’t a people pleaser and he doesn’t struggle with expressing his needs. Every time he wants to do something he says it to me, and if it’s a no he just politely says no. So he never keeps resentments (?not sure what’s the right word, like when you did something you didn’t really want to and you felt uncomfortable/resentful about it- that kind of feeling) inside. I’m aware of my issues and have been going to therapy for me having difficulty expressing my own needs and setting boundaries, but I feel like he couldn’t understand my struggles.

Idk I’m feeling that we may just not be compatible with each other. I went through an amicable yet excruciating breakup due to incompatibility 2 years ago and it took me a long time to heal and be happy again. At this point I’m just tired and frustrated about another one. I don’t want to feel that way anymore.

He’s been a great boyfriend for me. He took really good care of me when I threw up one time and he was textbook good at calming me down when I had anxiety. A lot of things he did make me feel like oh wow that really is a green flag and I feel very loved in this relationship. But when I expressed that I have those unmet needs it led us into conflicts. I’m willing to work things out and we said we were gonna have another conversation this weekend. But I’m really anxious and stressed out about it. I really need advice on how to approach the conversation in a mature and healthy way.",Free_Narwhal7302,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bzujm/i_expressed_my_needs_to_my_bf_and_he_felt/,1690556413.0,1.0
"Break up with my girlfriend for a *maybe*? I've (22m) been with my girlfriend (21f) for over 3 years, and the first two years went very well. In the last year we had 2 close calls: basically broke up then got back together within like an hour (so not sure if it counts as a breakup). After being together for 3 years, I do feel like its time to move on but I've never found the *right time* to break up, which probably doesn't exist.

Now comes the *new girl*, who is 1-2 years older than me and after knowing her for 7 months I've developed a crush. I've had this thought of breaking up with my girlfriend then eventually getting with the *new girl*, but I'm scared to risk it all for a **maybe**.

It's definitely a **grass is greener on the other side** situation and I don't think I know the new girl well enough, so it feels like a 10% chance at best.

I'm also really scared about how a break up may affect my girlfriend mentally, every close call we've had was especially tough on her. I feel like I am kinda ready to be single again, but I know for a fact that she isn't, and I will significantly affect her mental health if we broke up right now.

"When should you be sure you're ready to date? I feel like it's a complicated issue. Sometimes I wonder if I myself should isolate myself from dating and romance just to prevent any undue toxicity from myself or others. 

We all have issues. We all deserve love. Attention. Care. We don't deserve to unleash out worst traits on someone; and just because we love someone it doesn't mean our bad sides can't be bad for them. Exhaust them. Etc. 

I've had interest in people I shouldn't have because they clearly had some things that needed to be resolved before they could maintain a healthy relationship. But is that a lack of thick skin on my part? A lack of patience? My own issues mixing with theirs in bad ways?

So I (30m) met this lady online (29f) and really hit it off. Like more than sparks it's electric kinda thing. So I am not worried about  whether she will like me per se; as it is clear she already does. But she is coming for two days and has a kind of wild side. I told her straight up I would love to accompany her but Im not this nightlife trailblazer and she said its ok we would be there for each other and she would teach me etc. My worry is less about impressing her and more about the inconvenience of bar and club hopping (finding one/waiting in line at this heat etc) ruining the vibe of the date.

"{Male 25} how could I bring this up? 
I feel like I have a higher libido than most people I’ve spoken to and been with. 
My previous partner that’s been on and off for 3 years told me I can bring someone else in if I wasn’t satisfied enough which I refused since that not in my nature. That broke the dynamic quickly. 

I was wondering if I should joke about my sex drive or mention it in dating apps because I like to have multiple rounds and more than just once a day. (I know that can’t happen everyday) I know now it’s important for me so it’s a must , especially if I’m highly attracted. 

I’ve never spoken to anyone about this because I don’t want to come off as creepy I just find immense pleasure pleasing a woman It’s linked to my love language which is touch.  no drug gives me the same dopamine rush. I find pleasure with giving massages too which all the woman I’ve been with appreciate. 
I’m very spiritual so i I don’t act in lust but genuine connection.

I haven’t really dated around yet so I’m not sure if I’m just naive and that’s normal but from what I’ve heard not as common.

"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly. Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn’t okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He’s very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He’s also balding, I definitely don’t care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it’s not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he’s very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he’s okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he’s with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven’t told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don’t talk about men who don’t make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he’s very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I’m not. 

Like damn, I’m not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don’t want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I’m not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

If a person was trying to learn how to let’s say drive and every time they got behind the wheel they crashed horrifically.

I know now that I need to breakup with him, but it breaks my heart. I’ve shared so much with him and I’m honestly attached. I wanted everything to work out cause he is really sweet to me but the cons out way the pros. 

I’ve never broken up with anyone before so I really don’t know how to go about it. Since we are in a ldr I can’t do it face to face and I honestly don’t have the courage to do it over the phone. I’m scared he’ll talk me out of it, even tho I know it’s for the best. 

I could really use any ideas or advice on how to breakup with him. I don’t want to hurt him cause I really care about him. I want him to be able to get over me quickly cause I’d hate for him to be sad over someone like me. 

Any ideas on ways to tell him I want to break up, that won’t make him feel bad about himself or undeserving of a relationship. I don’t want to have a negative affect on him and any future relationships he gets into.

1. G, my ex we’ve been talking for months but she’s weaseled her way out of every meeting and now decided to delete my number 

2. A, does reiki and meditation and only seems to be interested in talking if I’m going to give her $20 to go to a reiki session. Granted the sessions are pretty nice, but she mentioned grabbing dinner after the next one only to ignore my next message.

I’ve personally got myself tangled up twice with women who were in love with me and with their other partner.    The situation was extremely frustrating and overwhelmed with sadness.   

These two women would make out with me and have sex with me but would not separate themselves from their other partners.      They also enjoyed having sex with those people.   

When I found out I ended the relationships but they would cry and become extremely angry and threatening.    They would bombard my phone with texts and calls begging me not to leave, that they would dump their partner to secure me, though that never happened, and would never happen.

I understand we had lock downs etc but I'm speaking after all that when people were going out and places were fully open overall. I had tried online dating on and off for the three years and it's been probably the most frustrating and draining experience of my entire life.

It's always ""I'll let you know"" ""I have to see if I'm busy"" all that type bullshit.

"How to know when is the right time to ask about exclusivity? I (24F) have been dating a guy (37M) for around 2 months. We don’t go on dates that often though because of traveling (we had a few trips in this time period) and work. Overall, we have been on 7 dates in 2 months. We do keep in touch over text but its not like we spend every free evening we have together or talk all the time. We started being intimate very recently and I stayed over at his place 2 times. Overall there have been no reasons for me to think there’s something wrong or any red flags apart from maybe the fact that the dating thing is progressing slower than I would like it to. I have recently realised after some thinking that I see this going further and want to be exclusive. I’m absolutely fine with doing it slowly and gradually but I have no clue on how to bring it up. I think communication is important and therefore I want to be honest but I don’t want to sound like i’m putting pressure on the person but rather just openly discussing on where we stand. I don’t have much experience when it comes to relationships so I’d appreciate any advice on how to bring this up and ask and start this type of conversation?

"Why do some people talk about their kinky dating tales (like how their first ever date ended into a wild threesome etc.) the moment you swipe them right on dating apps? So, there are some matches on the dating apps, where as soon as you swipe right, the person hints you about the questions you can ask to initiate a conversation. As soon as you do that, the other person goes like ‘It’s a really horny story..very unusual and intriguing..’ And when you ask them, it’s more or less like ‘you know we ended up having a threesome in my last date!’ 

I mean don’t they feel weird to share such stories with randos even before a hi-hello?

Does it mean they are trying to initiate sex chats with you or trying to test whether you get offended by their stories?

"4 years ago GoatLord8 found his girlfriend in this sub through a form he launched to find friends who don’t just send boring replies. What if AI could do that for you? I found a wholesome post on MNFH subreddit where a guy from Sweden launched a form with questions like how fast you reply, how open you are in conversation etc and the 8th response was of a girl from Turkey which stood out to him. They eventually started dating and the guy even flew to Turkey and shared a picture of their [first hug at the airport](https://imgur.com/a/DplfgFi). (can't link the post because auto mod keeps deleting).

What if there was an app where you post your introduction and let AI know what you are looking for. So if you are not someone who like people who text out of boredom or who have other intentions than what you are looking for, you can ask the bot to match people accordingly.

The way I plan to do is by making an app only for redditors out there making friends online where unlike any other social app, there are no comments but only posts where every reply on that post is a conversation. It is up to the person to either reply privately or publicly, in which case he will also let other people discover his thoughts through his conversations.

The AI will use those conversations to know people and make better matches. Obviously when it is a private conversation the AI would be out of picture.

"(Need some situationship advice) He gets offended if I stop being cheesy. I don't want to put in the effort unless we're dating. It's a privilege to be my partner and he's not getting it for free. For some context; we both liked each other in 2018 and 2019 but we were scared to confess so we moved on, dated new people and got cheated on, we reconnected and I confessed first, then we both fell for each other. We aren't dating yet because we're both not ready for a long distance relationship and I still have trust issues from being cheated on. We mutually agreed that we won't date anyone else and we'll date each other next year. 

It's like we're already dating but without the label. He keeps telling me he's afraid of hurting me, afraid of losing me, afraid he won't find another who would put in the effort like me. We flirt with each other on a daily basis, call each other 'babe' and say 'I love you's. The moment I talk to him without the flirting, he gets sad. I'm just thinking, why should I put in the effort if we aren't even dating? I have trust issues from being cheated on too. 

He doesn't have any red flags that I'm ignoring, he's motivating me to do better, he's understanding and caring, he respects my boundaries, there's no doubt he's way better than my ex. 

But if we both can't commit right now, why are we acting like a couple? If he really wants me to flirt and put in the effort, he has to upgrade me to the 'girlfriend' title. It's a privilege to be with me and he has to work for it if he wants me. I want to stop being cheesy with him, but he gets offended and sad. He thinks I'm losing interest. He starts overthinking. 

Is him saying ""I'm afraid to hurt you"" empathy or a warning? How do I stop flirting with him? Or should I?",StillRare7904,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bxdu6/need_some_situationship_advice_he_gets_offended/,1690550622.0,0.5
"Is it wrong that I (F24) paid for the second date, despite my date insisting that he (M24) would pay? He paid for dinner for the first date (which I sorta wrestled him for the check and I lost). Then when we went out the second time, I told him before we went to the restaurant that I'm buying, and he said ""we'll see about that"". I kept insisting that I would pay and he said that he would pay for half then. We go to the restaurant and we're already late for the movie, so we had to rush and I already had the card ready so I just handed it to the waiter. My date said ""thank you"" but also subtly mentioned that he feels like he should've been the one to pay because of gender roles or something.

Now I feel like maybe I shouldn't have been so adamant about paying. I just feel really bad sometimes because I like to order nicer food and bottles of sparkling water when I know I'm paying with my money, especially when I'm out at restaurants (which happened on the first date... he didn't even drink the sparkling water). I fully expected to pay for my meals.  He's a grad student right now so it makes me feel worse having to make him pay for me.

"My friends are dissing on me (42m) for rejecting a woman (45f) because I'm a virgin who never had a relationship. No matter how I write the title, it still reads weird to me. 

Anyway, 

I had a lot of trouble younger. Between my head that wasn't in a right place, dropping out of school, and a slew of other problems. Others were dating and so on, I was trying to stay alive. Over the years, I managed to get myself on the right track again. I got my head in a healthy place, I got back into university and managed to land a job that allows me to travel after years of not really knowing what I was doing in life. I put some money to the side and bought a house with a garden for myself in a small village.

However, it took me nearly 40 years to get to a place where I felt good, and it took pretty much all my daily time. I did try to date during it, because even other dudes who faced the same issues as I did managed to do so. Online, real life, show confidence, the usual.

I managed a lot of things in life, starting from a bad place. I'm proud of that, but I never got anywhere in dating. After 40, I gave up on it.

My friends know and don't mind. When their families leave them some time, we get to spend some together, and for a few of them the kids are starting to be grown-ups so I get to see them more often now.

They introduced me to one of their friends, who happened to also be single and share a number of hobbies with me. In short, we spend some time together, and down the line she asked me out, I said no. 

I'm over 40, and don't feel like starting to learn now how being with someone actually works, I'm twenty years late for that and she wants an adult, not an 18 year old kid. As far as I'm concerned, that ship has sailed. 

I didn't tell her that, I only said she's cool but I wasn't interested in her like that. 

Of course, my friends learned about me not going for it. They've been asking me endlessly why I haven't tried something, if just for the sake of experience. In a few days they will forget about it and drop it, I hope.

"I'm confused if guy 34M still interested in me or not I recently had 5 dates with a guy, which last 3 of those were consecutive like M, T, W. 

We had kissed/held hands on our 2nd date and on 3rd date, we ended up having sex. 

On 4th date (which was more like him stopping by at coffee shop where I was), we simply talked for few hours until coffee shop closed. Didn't become physical... which made me wonder if he was pulling away or if he was just tired.. 

On 5th date, we watched movie again ... walked around the park for 2 hours.. held hands,, talked about past relationship... our firsts impression of each other.. what he or I think it's important in relationship. He is observant type of person .. he said I will get surprised even more as we get to know each other.. Night went well.  

However, unlike previous dates, he didn't make any plans to meet like he used to. 

So I'm getting little anxious whether or not he is slowly losing interest or if he is wanting me to initiate date... 

(In terms of texting, we text few times a day. It's either him or me who initiate text but sometimes he is slow to respond.. sometimes fast.... whereas I am usually fast to respond... we talked about this .. and it seemed like we just had different type of texting style but still unsure if he is not that into me or what...)

"Went on a really weird date Yesterday I (24 F) matched with a guy (23 M) on bumble. He invited me over almost immediately. I said no but that I was free today. We agreed on coffee and then maybe going to my place. Usually I'd wait longer to go out with someone I met online but I was feeling spontaneous. I did tell him I don't sleep with guys on the first date and he respected that. 

We exchanged numbers. I texted him but didn't save his contact (I was going to if the date went well). He was overly friendly through text and acted like he knew we'd be dating for awhile. I politely told him to slow it down a little bit didn't cancel the date. 

On the actual date we kept a conversation flowing but he was extremely unemotional. It looked like he attempted to smile once or twice but couldn't figure out how to. I picked most of the conversation topics which is fine but it would've been nice if he had brought up at least one. Eventually he went to the bathroom, came back and said ""I appreciate you coming out but I don't think we're clicking. See you later."" I just said ""okay bye"" and hungout at the cafe for awhile. I had a feeling we wouldn't keep dating but it was still weird. Usually when a guy doesn't want to see me anymore (or vice versa) the discussion happens after the date.

"My(31M) girlfriend(32F) keeps stonewalling me whenever we have an argument/disagreement. It's giving me stress and anxiety and I cannot take it anymore. I started dating this girl about 3 months ago. The first month was pretty amazing. But the honeymoon phase ended way too early and we started getting into arguments/disagreements by the 2nd month itself. Whenever we have a disagreement, she sometimes gets agitated and starts gaslighting me. She often gets very angry and shuts me down by saying ""I don't want to talk right now"" and walks off. She doesn't come back until she cools down. If I try to bring up the discussion again, she just shuts me down by saying ""We already had a discussion over this and I hate going in circles"". Now this has happened way too many times for me to ignore. The inability to have a civilized discussion over any disagreement is giving me a lot of stress and anxiety because I'm being forced to bottle up my feelings. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her because I don't know what I do or say might accidentally trigger her and I don't want to get into fights every day. I have also observed that she just cannot handle losing an argument. If an argument ends up in her giving up, she tries to bring up something totally random from the past to keep the fight going until she feels like she has won the argument. I'm really tired of this and have been thinking of breaking up with her.

But I feel no romantic or physical attraction. Like, at all.   
I'm not curious about getting to know her more, I don't feel like I want to meet her again.

"We spent every moment of two weeks together, now he tells me about the other girl. Sorry about the long post, but this is my first post here and wanted to give the full story.

A month ago (23F) started this thing with a friend (27M) of mine. I was out of a 3 year relationship and had something going on afterwards with a close friend (24M). Let’s call 27M A and 24M B.  The thing with B had ups and downs and it was never anything exclusive. During this period A started showing a lot of interest in me, texting and asking to do things together. We weren’t very close back then but I always enjoyed his company so I was always up for it as well. We started to hang out a lot and got along so well. When we got drunk we were always flirting with each other and I really liked the attention and always found him very attractive. Getting along so well was an added bonus. Other people started to notice this and I got asked a few times if there was anything going on between A and I. A friend of mine who is way closer with A also told me that this guy really likes me and I should stop with B whatever that is and go for this guy (also because B was flirting with this other girl). 

I was quite confused at this stage because even though I really liked B it was always a bit problematic with him and now A charmed me a lot. For other reasons we stopped seeing each other romantically with B and decided to stay good friends. 

After a night out together with all of our friends, we went to A’s place to have an after party but nobody else was up for it. That night we stayed up till the morning and when I wanted to go home he asked me to stay over. We just cuddled all night and spent the next day together in bed, nothing else happened. Next day after a dinner at our friends place, A asked me to come over again, so I stayed at his place and we had sex. From that night onwards for about 2 weeks we slept together every night, spent the next day together and did a lot of fun things together. It was an amazing time but in the end I went back home for the summer and he will move to another country end of summer.

I always thought we wouldn’t talk a lot when I’m back home but we texted so far everyday and he wanted to call me quite often. We make each other laugh a lot, have a great connection going on and are very attracted to each other. But he is moving away so I wanted to ask him what would happen then. I never wanted a serious relationship, especially nothing long distance but I felt like I had to communicate my feelings. When I told him that I really like spending time with him and talking to him but it confuses me as well because he is moving away - he replied back with if I knew what is going on with his ex at the moment. I knew a bit but not so much in detail. So with this girl it never worked out because they were never at the same place at the same time and she never wanted anything exclusive at the time with him, so they agreed to see how it goes when he moves back to the city she lives in. 

We never had a conversation with each other about what we wanted from each other, I guess were both sure that we didn’t want anything serious but then we connected really well and it ended up being more than that. I’m confused because when I told him about my feelings and doubts, instead of him talking about his feelings he opened up the subject of his ex even though it was never a concern before. It seems to me that he avoided expressing his feelings. When I said maybe it’s better we just stop, he didn’t want that either. He said that he really likes me and enjoyed our time but can’t say anything right now because he is confused. He wanted sometime to think and meanwhile wants to keep in touch. He also asked me if it’s suppose to be everything or nothing.

Now I’m left wondering if in the end our connection was not so special and this was a casual relationship. But even if it is, he doesn’t want to let go of me. I’m also confused by what it means to have a casual relationship or if he is being a red flag over all.",smallandfurious69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bvf1m/we_spent_every_moment_of_two_weeks_together_now/,1690545479.0,1.0

"Outdated or new normal? Hi all, 

Male, 40, divorced here. 

I’ve been through the ringer the last year, but have taken time to find myself once again and work on myself via therapy, friends and working out, of course. It’s a process and so I know more time is needed and one is never a complete human. 

My question pertains to a couple of patterns I have encountered while dipping my toe into the dating pool. 

Both encounters for me went way better in person than via text and I felt like I’d established enough of a connection to maintain contact via text until the next meeting, which hadn’t happened. 

I am an open person and I’m not afraid to have tough conversations for better clarity. I would rather someone tell me that they’re not interested than what I am seeing via text.

It almost seems to me that expressing interest in seeing them, trying to have loose playful conversations before meeting, worked for me in the past. Admittedly, that was before online dating and texting became standard operating procedure.

I understand that maybe these women were not entirely interested in me from my recent experience. I had a good time with both of them and felt that perhaps something would come of it.

My question is, do y’all feel that the text game is one where you express limited interest, without much inclination to meet in order to be a viable match. 

What I’ve seen on that end, is very limited texting, more recently, a text or two a day with only a couple sentences. For me that put a lot of pressure to say something meaningful while matching their effort. Needless to say, both dates fizzled out in the virtual world. 

I’m not interested in being anyone other than myself (playing games to increase interest), but I do understand that the nature of dating has changed, the conversation style has changed, and I think, despite the promiscuousness of the scene, people are more guarded with their thoughts than their bodies. 

Am I accurate or am I just an outdated model of a man? 

Help me improve and get a much needed update. I don’t want to game the system, but I also don’t want to lose good connections from the wild whilst trying to manage the virtual realm poorly as I see it now. 

Many thanks, and I appreciate ya’ll who take the time to respond and consider what I’m asking.",FabulousBase9194,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bvaln/outdated_or_new_normal/,1690545104.0,1.0

"I was abused raped then ghosted by somone I love...how do I move on So it's a bit I'd an complex siatiatuon plz dont judge I just need support on how to get over him. So I was seeing somone else for about a month or so and alot happened he was abit absuive you could say? Well my family seems to think so and they think technically he assaulted me? As I told him I disnt want to have sex and espailly unprotected sex but he did pushed it while I was not sober. After that he made me deal with a possible pregnancy and miscarriage all by myself not even giving me a hug or allowing me to doke over during this time. He also barely texts me and ignores half my messages as we were just still just hanging out and not anything yet. 

After this I decided we are done and went on tinder to talk to other mature ppl idk what I was expecting a distraction I guesse. I was just talking to many ppl at once tondiatract myself. But one really stood out eventually I began talking to him eveeyday and our connection because intense we hadn't met yet but it was pretty romantic and both of said we never met or connected like this online before. I know it sounds silly maybe it wasnt real love but it was the begining stage it was more than flitting it was like we were in a realtionship we spoke about everything including trauma and suicide I really opened up and idk how bad his trauma was  ju he shared ally of family issues he had. At that point its more than just flirting the bond we built maybe wasnt so serious but I'd say equivalent to dating somome for a month atleast. Anyway this was happening at the same time I was dealing with previous guy as I matched with this new one just a few days after ending things. I was espially assaulted and showing all sorts of signs of possible pregnancy and misscarraige and maybe STI's? Ofc I couldn't talk to the new guy about this I had nobody to talk to about it after the possible miscarriage I reached out to the old guy and said I need to talk to him about wjat is going on to figure out what to do and I need suport which was a mistake as he is abusive and gave very limited suport if any. He made me feel worse the next day I went to the doctor to test for STIs and I just went to a clinic where they just are understaffed I guesse and pushed me out after a few questions (I guesse they did technically do what had to be done...but I felt they disnt take their time with me) I had more questions but they sidnt have time and just lost it after all this abuse. I know now ita stupid bit I went to the new guy for emotional support I told him everything of how I had unprotected sex and I might have possible Sti I want to get tested before starting anything qne the doctor made me feel worse. I even gave him a chance to say I understand if he doesny like me anymore. He just unmatched and blocked and ghosted. He is usually so supportive I was shocked.  I know that is alot or info I cant expect him to stick around but i thought at the least he would say I'm sorry about ur situation....I told him I got into an argument with my abuaive parents which lead me to go see that guy and not be sober and I was taken advantage of while not sober....so I thought  he would atleast say I'm sorry for what you went through but I need to put me first or I dont feel comfotable I hope you feel better but I cant continue. He just ghosted when I was  vulnerable and I know I know this alot to unload but I just thought atleast a simple "" I'm sorry to hear that but I am not interested take care of yourself bye "" he kept saying he wants to marry me lowkey and have his kids to which I said stop idk if I want marraige and he said I know i cant help how pwegwct you are I want to lock you down and make you mine forever. He also supported me emotionally when I was depressed. I know its alot to hear about stis but ghosting is so cowardly. By no means is he a bad guy but I think it shows he doesnt respect care or ""love"" me as much as I thought he did. Maybe he isnt all I thought he was in my head. He didnt know all the details but he knew I was with somone elses pretty recently which is one of the reasons I thought it was ok to tell him I wanted to get tested first?  I thought we would just wait till I get tested? Again its alot of info for sure he isnt q bad guy but maybe not the one if he is gonna abandon me like that without even a I'm sorry I cant do this.  Looking back out convos where not surfacey but the reason I feel for him is just because he treated me decent/respect well he did treat me well but I mean like he treated me like human which is something I'm not used to as I keep getting abused over and over again in my life. So maybe I'll find somone else who treats me decent too :/ idk I liked him I know its mostly my fault how do I get over him?",spoiledcandy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bufkn/i_was_abused_raped_then_ghosted_by_somone_i/,1690542618.0,1.0
"UPDATE: She asked to be exclusive, I agreed. Then she changed her mind a week later. Big date coming up, and I want an answer so I don’t waste my time. Hey All!

So posted a few weeks back about a girl I met on Bumble and how she flipped-flopped on wanting to be exclusive.
I appreciate all the advice you guys gave!

We ended up going to the concert/festival together and had a pretty great time.
But - something very important came up that made me change my mind about the whole thing. 

I learned she is still in communication with her ex and clearly not over him. She talked to me a few times on previous dates about how she is still upset with him for cheating on her, but I just took those conversations as her opening up to me. However, at the show she made an effort to tell me that her ex was texting her during the show and again talked about how she is angry at him and really hopes ""karma teaches him a lesson."" 

This was the main deal breaker for me. I know some people get over their exes by jumping back into dating, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. At this point I realized that she's probably just dating around and looking for a distraction. The day after the show I asked for some space and took about a week off from talking to her so I could think things over. That Friday I made the call to end things since she wasn't ready for what I was looking for. 

Thankfully, she was understanding about it and things ended OK. I chose to remove all contact on phone/social media etc. 

I'm still bummed that I gotta start over as I really liked her, but I know that it was best for me to call it there and move on.",AnOrangePenguin,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b6tuy/update_she_asked_to_be_exclusive_i_agreed_then/,1690476361.0,0.98

"Is what my girlfriend is doing toxic? I (34M) started dating my girl (33F) about a month ago. We went official after talking for a while. I suffer from ADHD and many times I forget some small things that were discussed or said. My girl has always been saying that she hates repeating herself because she does that at work with people she manages and it drives her crazy. 
She sometimes makes plans with her friends to go watch a movie or hang out or some shit. Most of the times she tells me. But today she suddenly said she was going to a movie with her girlfriend. She said she told me about but I don't think she did. She kept insisting but I forgot or didn't pay attention. I'm a movie person and I would at least remember the name if she did. 
But since she hates repeating herself, she didn't tell me what movie she is going to or where, despite me asking her a couple times. I kinda find this behavior shady, even though I believe she's not the type of person to cheat.

"Talking phase/ dating advice (24F) and (25M) I’m (24F) starting to get back into dating and decided on using hinge. I dating a couple guys in college but some never reached the official bf/gf title stage. Anyways, he’s (25M) and he lives in Miami and is the owner of a family medicine clinic. He told me that’s he’s about to open another location in Aventura and lately he’s been traveling for conferences across the US. 

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting. So far he seems really nice and we vibe. Only thing is the past week I’ve gotten a text like once a day replying and or ❤️ some of my text responses. Maybe I’m just overthinking but is that a 🚩? He might just be busy since he texted me that a couple times but i heard someone else say no man is that busy. Again it’s been a hot minute since I’ve talked/ dated and my previous encounters were in person so Ik online can be different. My sis said that’s not a red flag since I technically hear from him once a day in the talking phase.

Do you think the distance in the potential relationship could work? Orlando to Miami is like a 3 1/2- 4 hour drive or 1 hour flight on the weekend. If all this actually works out I can’t wait to be all over this man. Ngl I’m struggling to not message something crazy but I don’t want to put out the wrong vibes yet and get to know him. Ladies not sure if it’s just me but I feel like once you start to go down that rabbit hole with men it’s hard to turn back lol. I’ll give it 2-3 months time.

You smoothed it once. In such away that I lost my breath. 

Now I did this fairly often with you. I'd catch myself staring at you. And need to breathe deeply, quietly. I know there were times it was an uncontrolled, almost audible deep breath. As I'd catch myself lusting deeply. 

But that moment. The way your hair laid. The look on your face. The light beard. And... just you.

"She canceled before first date. Benefit of the doubt or move on? This girl matched with me on a dating app last Friday. I responded to her message, and she got back to me Saturday night where I suggested we grab dinner. She said she'd love to, but couldn't do the initial time I suggested because she said the week is kind of tough for her to make plans (which was totally fine with me because I usually don't like going out on weekdays anyway). She suggested the coming Saturday, but today (Thursday), she says she can't make it because her job is calling her to work at the time we agreed to on Saturday. I used to have a pretty demanding job that sometimes forced me work weekends and nights, so I told her I totally get what she's dealing with. 

Basically on the one hand: she's the one who suggested the time for the date originally, and she gave me a decent amount of notice before asking for a raincheck. On the other: she didn't immediately respond with a concrete alternative day/time, but maybe I should prompt that for her?

"Casual Dating A Guy BUT He's Acting Serious - Should I Ask if There's Hope for More? Met a guy on Hinge and we've been dating for a month now. We had our first date - dinner and ended up making out and having sex. We both talked a bit before hooking up that we both had only been in long term relationships previously and were trying out dating. We both said we weren't looking for something serious at this point and exploring dating. I stated that while I am open to having sex, I also wanted to get to know him be respected and like each other. He mentioned wanting to know the other person cared. We carried on - having dates every week, dinner, talking and having sex. The chemistry has been really great physically. I've been trying to take it slow but he texts me nearly every single day asking how I am and sharing how he's day is.  
When I ask him to adjust certain things he does it and remembers it going forward - ex: asking for cuddling after even though he said he didn't even do that for his relationships (7 years) - but each time he cuddles me after and asks if its good? He has been doing more and more things for me - paying every dinner, pouring my drinks, bringing me water when I cough, being more gentlemanly and always asking me out/initiating conversations. I find it very confusing and think it is definitely making me get feelings because of his attentiveness + the consistent good sex. I am really scared by this and have considered cutting him off many times now b/c of the feelings. I am not sure if I should bring up because we had previously  already mentioned just keeping things 'casual' even though he isn't acting casual. And mentioned that I want to get to know each other and not just have sex which he agreed and said he likes spending time with me but also does want to continue having sex --&gt; confusing statement still. 

  
Out of repressing these feelings - this week I said I'm not sure if he even likes me sometimes because he's a very reserved person. He said like can be interpreted many ways and hesitated. Finally he said he likes spending time with me and also 'the other thing we talked about' (having sex).

  
I am also unsure of bringing it up b/c  because we've only been seeing each other for 1 month - though I really don't want to get more hurt in the long run if I continue to develop feelings even though I don't even want to jump into a relationship either but just want to know that there CAN be a possibility sometime in the future if feelings continue...

  
tldr: Why does a guy who agreed to be casual start acting like a bf? Or is this just how men can compartmentalize feelings and if I should ask him if there is any potential to be open to more in the future after dating for 1 month? Should I let him know I am starting to get feelings and am considering ending things if he doesn't have any capacity for more in the future?",Thin_Vacation_813,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bmvvr/casual_dating_a_guy_but_hes_acting_serious_should/,1690517349.0,1.0

"How can I stop thinking about a guy? So I reconnected with an old friend a few months ago and I've had slight feelings for him, but not much where it's impacted me.

Ive learnt that I have issues with developing infatuation-type feelings for people not long after meeting them and I usually try not to follow them since I'm scared I'll overwhelm the other person.
But anyway, I've been coping fine with these feelings and haven't let them get in the way of our friendship.

I hung out with him yesterday, it wasn't a date or anything romantic - just 2 friends hanging out and nothing romantic happened which I wasn't expecting

After we left, I got home and went to bed and just woke up thinking about him a lot and it was hard to control. I don't want my feelings to ruin our friendship as I don't know what he thinks of me but at the same time I don't wanna be completely upfront about them to him as we've only just rekindled and I don't wanna scare him off.

"Have to stop doing my salsa classes... So I recently took up salsa dancing, I tried one class initially because I heard that a lot of women did it, but found myself enjoying it and over the last few weeks I just focused more on dancing rather than dating.

I got pretty acquainted with the people in the class, especially with these two women who are friends who have done these classes for longer than I have: we will call them A &amp; B.

A &amp; B would always try to talk to me during partnered lessons, and volunteered to dance with me at a salsa social event last month. 

I decided to ask A for her number and we met up the next day for a walk and talk, did our own dancing lesson in the park and made out. 

Next week A was friendlier to me but B was suddenly very distant and cold. The two were not talking to each other. I went to another lesson that week and when I tried to talk to B, she made a passive aggressive comment (can't remember it). 

The next week I went to class, I saw A &amp; B arguing over something before it started, then they kept distance from each other. I asked A what was wrong and she just said that ""B was just stirring drama over nothing"".

Later that week both A &amp; B suddenly went cold to me at class. A wasn't returning my texts. After class the teacher made a ""disclaimer"" about students dating each other and about ""being respectful"". The teacher then spoke to me after class to say that ""he didn't think the lessons were working out"".

I was confused and upset but before I left, another women, we'll call her C, approached me and let me know that A &amp; B talked about me to the other women and notified me that the same thing happened with another guy who had previously done these classes. 

Apparently that guy dated both A &amp; B and they had issues with each other but then ""took it out on the guy"" and discredited him.

What was going on here? I still have a few weeks left of these classes I paid for, do I keep going or just go to another school?",2guyshangingoutnaked,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bq0mk/have_to_stop_doing_my_salsa_classes/,1690527788.0,1.0
"Weird situation with ex and family (18M)(18F) So my ex and I broke up a year ago (18M) (18F). (Disclaimer those ages aren’t correct, it’s just to pass the bot). It was a pretty easy breakup, not much to it, although it was entirely out of the blue. We were friends for about a year prior (high school). She blocked me on everything and apparently hates me now. I’m not sure why, we haven’t even talked since before the breakup. But, supposedly, someone told her a bunch of fake rumors about me, and she absolutely ate them up. However, they’re all extremely far fetched and the complete opposite of my personality and things that I would do. 

But she continuously takes little shots at me. For example at parties she’s made comments at me when she walks past. One example being when I was helping my friend who wasn’t doing great to a couch and she said “maybe you should sit down too” (I was completely fine if you know what I mean). 

At the start of the school year I heard from a mutual friend that she wanted me to ask her to homecoming which I said no to, as I assumed it was a joke and also just didn’t feel like it. She has also called me once or twice through the year as using the unknown caller thing (I heard her voice in the background).Her friends snap me pictures of her continuously every few weeks. 

I find this all very weird. I don’t have any problem with her. To be honest, I’d have said that I have a positive opinion on her until I saw her shit talking me on a friends phone, despite us breaking up a whole year ago, and her being the one to do it. 

Now my question is how to deal with this. The obvious answer is to ignore her, which is I’ve done for the past year. However, our families are good friends and my parents continually tell me I should try to fix things, even just saying hi to her. Her parents also really like me and supposedly want us to be friends as well but that’s just what I’ve heard. And I don’t think her parents know about whatever this drama is. 

The more important part is that we have mutual friends which makes it awkward, mainly on her part, when we’re around each other. We’re likely going to have a lot of classes together next year, how do I deal with this? What’s the best way to go? 

There’s a lot of details that I left out, so feel free to ask if something doesn’t make sense or whatever.

"Can I believe my boyfriend that he is fine with us waiting to have sex? I (20F) have been with my bf (21M) for 5 months. I'm a virgin and the idea of sex freaks me out for numerous reasons, so we haven't done anything yet. As weeks go by, I get more and more scared he will dump me because he's not getting laid. 

I tried to remedy this by deliberately getting blackout drunk before having sex last Saturday (I sneaked a tequilla bottle in my bag and drank it in one shot in the bathroom). He was very displeased with that though, refused to have sex and drove me home; he's been lowkey angry with me since. 

Today we had a conversation about it and I admitted I do not feel ready for sex rn, even though I will try to get ready in the next couple months. I made up a story about still being affected by purity culture, which sounded completely plausible since I come from an immigrant family (the real reasons paint me as insecure and somewhat insane, there is no way in hell he ever finds out about them). He reassured me, said that's not a problem and that even though he would obviously like to have sex with me he doesn't mind waiting some more until I feel ready. 

The problem is, I don't believe him. I can't shake the feeling he only says that bc that's what I want to hear and it is just as true as my purity culture sob story. He's a 21 year old healthy guy, he obviously has to have sexual needs that require satisfaction. It would be naive to expect him to hang around when he could go on Tinder and get a hot girl to sleep with him within an hour. I fear he's secretely resenting me for not putting out, that he'll end up dumping me if I don't become ready to have sex soon enough and the entire thing drives me even more anxious. How can I get proof that he's genuine? Everything I manage to think of could backfire tremendously (like for example getting a friend to try to seduce him).",throwaway12856439,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bpm4l/can_i_believe_my_boyfriend_that_he_is_fine_with/,1690526415.0,0.57

Online dating and IRL hybrid concept So I'm thinking about having a bunch of business cards with a basic online dating profile description printed on them with a Google phone number. I even might make one of those free websites and create a dating profile and have a QR code on the card that links to it. Then I could just go around and hand them out to any girl who I find attractive. As a girl would this completely weird you out or would you be intrigued? I figure it would be cheaper than a membership for a dating site and it would reach some girls who might not be into the whole online dating scene.,RavenousFox1985,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15boo2h/online_dating_and_irl_hybrid_concept/,1690523186.0,1.0
"Why do casual “fun” partners have a different standard applied to them as opposed to relationships? I just saw a comment from a woman and it made me ponder this more.

As a guy, I think this applies for most. For HOOKUPS we often LOWER our standards.

This woman was commenting on a post where they were talking about height in dating. 

She said: 
“I'm sad for him. Yes it's harder for short men. I know my gf and main FWB swipe left on every guy under 6 unless he's fall-off-your-chair handsome (and even then not less than 5'10). They are looking for casual sex though.”

So this seems to imply that women LOWER their standards but for RELATIONSHIP partners. This kind of tracks with what I’ve read elsewhere but that was awhile ago, and could be false, idk.

Why is it the opposite between genders? Is that okay? Is casual fun inherently different than romantic fun?

"I fantasized about my husband’s best friend, and my subconsciousness punished me I’m so sorry about my long post, but I just needed to put this out somewhere. My husband (27m), his best friend (26m) and myself (25f) have just returned home from a children’s summer camp, where we worked as volunteers. It was the first time I brought them to the camp (I’ve been a volunteer at that camp since I was a teenager), and they both did amazing as volunteers. The best friend was so nice to me all week, since I had a bigger responsibility this year, and I was very nervous about it. My husband was also very supportive, but the best friend (let’s call him Tony) was even more. Every day he told me and the other volunteers how great I was doing, and how cool I was for doing it. He stayed up late with me every night to keep me company, when I was working on the tasks for the next day. He build stuff for me that I needed and was just very kind. Tony and I are also really close, and I actually see him as my best male friend too. 
And btw he is also our neighbor, so we live right next to each other. Like Tony lives on the other side of the wall with his girlfriend.
Well, the other volunteers from the camp all loved Tony since he was so hardworking, kind and fun, and they told me that over and over. 

On the last day of the camp, I cuddled up next to my husband, and I started fantasizing about being with Tony. I thought about us having sex. I LOVE my husband and I DON’T wanna be with anyone else but him, but in that moment, it just crossed my mind. 
I fantasized for maybe ten minutes, and then I fell asleep. 

And then I started dreaming.. 
I dreamed that we agreed on switching partners, so that I would be with Tony and my husband would be with Tony’s girlfriend. My husband and the girlfriend left the camp early to go home. Tony and I left the next day, and when we came home, I missed my husband so bad. I sneaked into my old apartment, and nobody was home. I looked around, and noticed that ALL of my belongings were already gone, and the place looked totally different. It looked like her. I was shocked as to how fast my husband just “got rid of me”, and I went to the bedroom. It was still our old bed. On the bed was my husband’s phone. I took it and looked at the chat between my husband and the girlfriend. Right then my husband entered the room, and got down next to me on the bed. There was no emotion in his face, and he just encouraged me to look his phone through if I needed to. I looked through their conversation, and they were already so flirty and sexual. They seemed so happy together, and I could suddenly see that they’ve had the best, most passionate sex over and over. 
I broke down crying, and I cried so loudly. My husband didn’t react or comfort me, but just looked at me and said “that’s just how it is now”. I all of the sudden knew, that in the moment I agreed to the switch of partners, I was dead to him. 

I woke up, because my husband shook me (because I apparently was crying in my sleep also). I continued to cry after I woke up and I felt devastated. My husband comforted me and held me, and he asked what I had dreamed. I told him about the dream (I didn’t tell him about my fantasy the night before), and he just said over and over, that he would never want to be with anyone but me, and that it was just a stupid dream.

I’ve been feeling icky all day, and I feel so bad about the fantasizing. I feel like I cheated or something. My husband has experienced cheating in past relationships, and he is VERY touchy about it. He has been clear since day one, that if I ever cheated, that’s it. This is of course SO fair, and the right mindset to have,  but now I just feel so scared because of those thoughts and that dream.

At the same time I feel so depressed about the dream, because it felt so real, and I just keep seeing my husband’s ignorance towards me, the empty apartment, and the images of him and the girlfriend having wild sex. I struggle a lot with jealousy and retroactive jealousy, so it hits so hard on me - and I also feel heartbroken thinking about my husband and I splitting up..

I feel like I’m disgusting and a terrible person, but at the same time I feel like it’s natural to occasionally fantasize about others. But maybe it’s not?",sensano123,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b8fms/i_fantasized_about_my_husbands_best_friend_and_my/,1690480118.0,0.68
"What would you make of a person who wanted to marry you within a week or month of meeting you? So I met a woman on facebook, who was really very stunning. We both expressed in interest in  marriage when speaking on the phone, and in text. After meeting we really indulged in some serious physicality, and togetherness. Within a week or 2 she became extremely marriage crazy.

"She mentioned swinging I’m seeing a girl who is a fair bit younger than me and I’m her first serious partner. She says that I have “sexually blown her mind” and now she is keen to try loads of new stuff she has never done before with me. Anyway, previously we had both discussed that we were monogamous and we joked about not relating at all to the multiple partners / polyamory thing that’s popular at the moment.

We were doing a quiz asking each other sexual questions, she answered no to everything to do with threesomes / watching other couples / open relationships etc. But then it got to one that was would you try swinging and she said “I’d try it” which surprised me so I asked “what?” and she said “are you sure you’d want to be with just one person for the rest of your life?” to which I said well yeah and then it was just very awkward and she then looked worried and backtracked and was like “don’t get me wrong I’m monogamous too” there was an awkward silence and I couldn’t really get her to elaborate.

Later on she apologized for scaring me and said ”trust me I’m not poly”.

But now I feel like she changed what she said because she knew it wasn’t acceptable to me rather than just “misspoke”. But I also feel like if I keep prodding at it and probing I’ll come off as insecure. How would you handle this? If she’s truly someone who would want to be poly in the future I’d break it off now and save myself the future hurt.",HailMary74,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bi2uj/she_mentioned_swinging/,1690503308.0,1.0
"Incompatible finances, compatible everything else I (26F) just entered a new relationship and I’m staring to feel that our difference in finances will be our downfall.

He (27M) is working full-time and rents a decently sized apartment in our major US city. He can take care of his basic needs but doesn’t have much leftover to spend on dates, gifts, or sweet gestures. I make high 6-figures and have been increasing my income rapidly for the last two years. I own my townhouse and have a good sum left to put towards investments and savings after paying my bills.

Prior to entering this relationship, we had a discussion of what a perfect relationship would look like. I stressed that being taken care of is important to me, and while I do not need to rely on a man for support, I prefer it. He said something along similar lines of being a provider. 

Great, our relationship values align. We’re amazing together in bed. Our personalities mesh well. However, I have yet to see any action or ambition towards becoming a provider. He’s working on gaining more experience to work up the ladder at his company, but it could be years before he’s able to live comfortably (or what I would consider comfortable). 

I love flashy dates, nice vacations, mutual spoiling and I can’t see myself doing that in the near future. I adore him and spending time getting closer… but I have this terrible thought that I will soon resent our financial circumstances.

"What does it mean when a guy checks your LinkedIn multiple times? I'm asking for a friend. The situation is that she has been working on a school assignment with this guy. They had an almost 4 hour phone call to work on this assignment together. Shortly after she ended the call at the agreed time, she gets a notification that someone viewed her LinkedIn, which turned out to be the guy she was on a call with. 

As a bit of a background, I heard through the grapevine that this guy was dating a girl back in Oct 2022, but he has never brought up his girlfiend in conversation. My friend and this guy don't follow each other on social media, but they contact each other through a WhatsApp group chat. Her WhatsApp account initially didn't have a profile picture, but now she has a profile picture of herself. They both have worked on other assignments before and he had viewed her LinkedIn a few times before this incident. Each time, he views her LinkedIn after their phone call. He is also aware of my friend's career path through some small talk they've made over time. My friend and I find it odd that he viewed her LinkedIn multiple times.

"Would you date someone that didn’t have a car? So is a grown adult not owning a car a deal breaker? I F(25) have been dating M(33) for about 4 months now. Just for context, we have been best friends for a long time, but didn’t talk for about a year or two due to my past ex 7 year relationship. I love the guy I am with and am incredibly happy. He treats me like a queen but he does not have a car and that honestly turns me off a bit. It didn’t bother me at first, but I figured he would eventually work towards that or had some desire to drive again. He used to have a license until he was in his mid twenties. He  had a hard time in his early twenties before I met him and couldn’t afford insurance and car payments so he just sold the car &amp; stopped driving. Now since it’s been so long since he drove he would have to retake the drivers test, pay for car registration, pay for car insurance, gas, and car payments. He claims it makes more sense for him to Uber because he works walking distance from where he lives and that its cheaper to Uber than paying for everything involved to own a vehicle. I expressed to him how I see a future with him but I need some security. If I was ever sick, couldn’t drive, or if we had children I would want him to have a car and be there for me. Not to mention you can’t always rely on Uber, we live in suburbs in dfw and we get crazy weather so Uber isn’t always readily available. I don’t want it to feel like I’m driving my child around everywhere when he’s 8 years older than me. I confronted him about all of this and he just didn’t seem to think there’s much of an issue with not having a car. I’m not sure what to think or do about this. He is a little stubborn, but he did say he’d work towards that. I love him and we don’t have any issues. He also has a secure job and could afford to save for a car. Thoughts?

"How much honesty is too much when you're down bad ? First post here so sorry if it doesn't follow the rules. 

Thing is: I have only dated two people in my life. Both of which were asexual, which is fine, but I discovered that I am REALLY NOT ace. Like, at all.

And though my last relationship ended more than a year ago, I came to realise over time that this was toxic as hell (never actually aknowledging that we were dating, manipulation my emotions a bit...). 


So that brings me to my current situation. I tend to associate relationships with the absence of sexual interactions, which I know is false, but I've been kinda conditionned to think like that.


I DO NOT CARE about love or dating for now. I just want as much sex as possible, to catch up the years I ""wasted"". I want to make it clear that I don't feel pressured in any way to have sex, it's just something that is super enjoyable for me. Unlike some people, I believe hookups can be meaningful and I want to profit of my youth to live a lot of experiences. Settling down can wait.

I currently have one fwb, whom I plan on keeping having intercourse with, but for diversity's sake I'd like to find more people who are dtf. (Again, this is not polyamory, no feelings are involved)

Which brings me to my title: how honest should I be with people about wanting sex without throwing away my chances. Because I value clear communication and being on the same page, but I don't seem to find people who share my needs. Does it turn off people to say you're horny and just wanna get to business ? Do I have to present it in a particular way ?

"What is a generally accepted time frame to go on initial dates (1-3)? I (29M) went on a first date/grab a drink with a girl (25F) a week ago. We had fun and had good conversation for around 2 hours before she had to leave. At the end, she mentioned that food would be the plan for our next meetup, so I took that as a good sign.

Since then, she has been very low contact, whereas before our meetup, she was relatively easy to text with. Now, it is maybe 1 text every other day. I’m not stupid and I know what this means. Its happened to me before. I realize that people have lives outside of the person they’ve only met once, but when I can see them active on social media, I mean come on, are we that childish?

That’s why I’m trying to decide if I should give one last bit of rope for this girl. This is only balanced out by what she mentioned at the end of our first meetup—of which she seemed genuine, but I’m no mind reader. The last text I sent her was along the lines of “are you still interested in meeting up again?” Of which there is no response yet.

My question is, what is a generally acceptable timeframe to go on 2nd or 3rd dates?

"Me (30M) and GF (30F) broke up. Now seeing 31F). TL;DR: Honestly didn't think I'd come here for advice but my mind is twisted and I don't know how to act on this.

Me and my gf broke up after 5 years. I don't really want to go into detail about her because this isn't about her.

I met this girl through work. We rarely see each other at work and we both like to keep it that way just so there isn't any complications. We hung out a couple times outside of work. 1st was dinner and 2nd was an activity day and from what I assume, she loved it. It was a perfect day. And she wants to hang out again.

Throughout us talking for the past month or so, we would both get to know each other. In our conversations, I would drop the first flirting hint and she dropped one immediately back at me. She compliments my eyes and my work attire and I told her she's gorgeous no matter what she's wearing. Then she told me I made her blush.

Seems like every convo we have, we're laughing and having a good time. She asks me all these questions about my life. Interests family hobbies things like that. Go into detail about it. Most people wouldn't really want to know about. We seem to have a lot in common as well as far as personal goals. Love for animals. Same taste in music. We were talking about movies and Barbie (don't ask why) but then she says. I can be Ken and she'll be Barbie. Stupid I know but It's just a vibe when I hang out with her.

She has a daughter and I'm not deterred by that. I'm usually good with kids. And I've showed I'm interested in knowing more about her daughter and taking her up on her offer of having my niece and her daughter hang out.

When we last hung out. I walked her to her car and told her how I felt. That I'm attracted to her. I didn't really ask her for her feelings and she didn't give them out either. I hugged her. We held each others hands and then she came in and hugged me one more time. 

Idk if she's not attracted to me or just using me for attention to go out and do things and be spontaneous or if she's nervous about telling me. She has told me I make her nervous when she's around me. But when we do hang out it doesn't seem that way. I'm more of the nervous one.

"My fourth date——about my dating experience on a herpes dating site Online dating can be a rather exciting, albeit sometimes awkward, journey. I had tried the typical avenues: Tinder, OkCupid, Match, but it wasn’t until my journey took a twist and led me to a rather unique platform, a herpes dating site, that I had this experence in my memory.

Herpes dating sites are designed to provide a safe platform for people who have herpes. It’s a place where they don’t have to fret over the ‘big reveal’ and where they could meet people who understand their condition. Stepping into the platform was a bit intimidating at first, but the supportive community genuinely eased my anxieties.

It was during this period that I crossed paths with Jenna, and she is my forth date.

Jenna had an effusive sparkle in her eyes - something that could lift anyone’s spirits. Our conversations were intriguing and emotive, and our first three dates had flown by effortlessly, filled with laughter, shared secrets, and a sense of familiarity.

For our fourth date, we decided on something we hadn’t attempted before - a hiking trip to a nearby nature reserve. The decision sprung from a shared longing for the tranquil outdoors, a break from our city-bound routines - a little adventure, if you will.

The day started with a hearty breakfast at a charming café, complete with lively chatter and infectious laughter. Following which, we embarked on our journey towards the nature reserve, the butterflies in our stomachs hinting at the adventure that awaited us.

The thing about hiking is that it’s a struggle wrapped in magnificent views. We huffed and puffed, and laughed at our shared struggle. Together we traversed through thick trees and muddy terrains, with the only sounds being our footsteps, our hearty laughter, and the hymn of nature around us.

Near the top of the trail, we found a secluded spot overlooking the picturesque scenery beneath us. The place was quiet, serene, with only our soft breaths disturbing the peace. Sitting there, she opened up about her experiences with herpes - the fear, the anger, the acceptance, and finally, the understanding that it did not define her. I admired her strength and reciprocated with my own tale of reckoning.

What made this date different was not the stunning vistas or the adrenaline-rush from the hike, but the raw emotions and shared vulnerability. It was a firm reassurance that this platform had achieved its goal: to connect, to resonate, and to provide companionship beyond the stigma of herpes.

We walked back when dusk fell, the lulling voices of nature guiding our path. That night, surrounded by desolate beauty, we grew closer in understanding and empathy.

The experience that unfolded that night only strengthened our bond, highlighting the importance of understanding, empathy, and genuine acceptance beyond the imperfections. It taught me that love and intimacy transcend physical conditions, and what truly matters is the emotional connection between two people.",N111ko_for_dating,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15biwxx/my_fourth_dateabout_my_dating_experience_on_a/,1690505627.0,1.0
"Should I (male, 23) give her more time, or is it just her excuse for not knowing how to tell me that she doesnt like me? I’ve been knowing this girl for a couple of months, been on a couple of dates, she even went on a weekend vacation with me and my friends… We talked alot, became really comfortable around each other, really liked each other, basically, after some time, we were doing things normal couples do. I asked her should we make it official that we are bf and gf and she said she needs more time to catch feelings. I was fine with that and said ok. We still talked normally but I felt like she was pulling her self away after some time. She didnt have time for seeing me, even texting was different. I confronted her about that and she said its true and she dont know why. Two weeks ago she went on a trip in different country, I told her that we will talk after she gets back home, she said: thank you for giving me more time, you should be angry at me for stalling (something in that context) I will call you when I get home.

Advice Hey so I work at my uncles pizzaria and there’s this really cute girl that works there. I don’t see her often because she usually works nights and I usually work mornings. However occasionally I do see her. Sunday is her last day for the season as she goes back to school. I really want to ask her out on a date but am extremely nervous. As I said I haven’t seen her many times but when we do we talk a lot and even sometimes banter. I cannot tell if she likes me. She goes go to school in a different state but I’m thinking maybe I’ll be able to go on a date with her before she leaves. I feel awkward since I am the bosses nephew and don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable at her work place. She’s also 19 and I’m 25. And I’ve never been on a date with a girl younger than me. Is this a problem in your opinion? It’s just that this girl really caught my eye. I was thinking of approaching her and saying something like hey I know it’s your last day would you want to grab some dinner before you go back to school? Not sure how to approach it or how to ask her. Would appreciate some advice thanks,Advanced_Ad288,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bi7f3/advice/,1690503655.0,1.0

"Broke Birthday Ideas for my Boyfriend of 1 Year? Hello all! I’m a bit embarrassed to be putting myself out there like this, but if it means I can get some inspiration for gift/activity of ideas for my significant other, then I’m all for it. It’s my boyfriends 29th  birthday in a few days, and we are going through a rough patch right now (more on that in a minute). Basically we’re flat broke, and I want to make his birthday as special as I can on a limited budget. I know he will be more than happy just to spend the day with me, but I also know from lurking on the site that Reddit can be a gold mine for ideas, especially for situations like this!

A little bit of backstory, for those interested: I met my boyfriend about a year ago. I had ended an abusive relationship about a year prior that was very toxic and unhealthy, and was apprehensive about going back into the dating scene. However, this guy really charmed the socks off me from the start, and while we took it slow in the beginning, he has really gone the distance to show me what being treated with respect and care feels like. Basically, without wanting to go on a spiel or be cheesy, he shows me what being special feels like, and I love to show it back in any big or little way that I can. For my birthday last year, he took me out to dinner, and got me a nice outfit, and a beautiful necklace. And a lovely card with a heartfelt note penned inside. It’s been years since I did anything special for my birthday, and I think he inferred as much, so he really went all out for me and the whole gesture just meant so much to me. Fast forward a few months and we’ve hit a rough patch, and by that I mean we’re staying in his car right now, and working odd jobs to get by until we find something more stable. So the Tres Leches cake I wanted to make for him, and the other more expensive gift ideas, will have to wait until next year. 

I want to make it perfectly clear that I am under no pressure or obligation from him to buy or do something for his birthday, and when I asked if there was any activity he had in mind for the day, he simply wanted to spend the day with me. This is my own desire to have a special day for him, for the reasons I described above. So, does anyone have any creative budget gift or activity ideas? I was was thinking maybe a coupon book, you know for “free backrubs” or “head whenever you want” but A) it’s really hard to give a backrub in the car and B) the second idea is already something that’s taken care of regularly, so it seems kind of lame to give coupons for it… 

Anyway, I’m open to suggestions! Thanks very much in advance if you took the time to read and comment! I know I’ll be able to make him smile no matter what. 🙂",rosalie_vellaveros,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bi12c/broke_birthday_ideas_for_my_boyfriend_of_1_year/,1690503169.0,1.0

"My best friend got together with my ex and hid it from me for 7 months. I dont know if this is the right place to post this and im sorry if it isnt.




I have been friends with this girl for 7 years. We have a great friendship, i opened up to her, we went on vacantions together, shared personal information and so on.   

I had a long distance relationship with a guy which she knew of, it was a healthy relationship id say but we broke up because life got in the way. After a few months, he messaged my best friend asking for support which i found weird as hell. I did tell her i wasnt comfortable with her offering him support and i respectfully asked her not to talk to him (bear in mind that i didnt force her, i only communicated how it made me feel) because he has friends he can go to for support and his family. I thought it was weird to ask for support from my best friend but okay. She did end up replying to him and she told me she felt bad for him but she told me she wasnt going to talk to him anymore in order to respect me. Fast forward to today, she confessed to me that she kept talking to him and that they got close and then got together (on the 1st of january). At the time when she started speaking to him, she was in a relationship and she lied to me saying that she broke up with her ex-boyfriend in february when they actually split in early december.

I want to add the fact that i do not have any feelings for my ex and it has nothing to do with him, but with her. I am in no shape or form jealous but i feel disgusted by what she did.

"My BF passes gas a lot and I don’t know how to bring it up. Hey everybody! This is my first post here. I have a question and need to vent a little I think. I (black 30f) have been dating a wonderful guy (white33m) for about 2 months now. It’s my first ever relationship. He’s a wonderful guy! Clever, kind, funny and so gentle. I enjoy being with him so much and love almost everything he does with me. But there is one problem that’s been bothering me. He often passes gas when we are together. It’s the silent but deadly type. It’s not on every date, about 60%, but it’s awful. The worst part is that he gives no reaction. No apology or “excuse me” or rolling down the windows. The first time we were at a show and cuddled up together and I kept getting this awful smell and I didn’t want to believe it was him because would you really just let it lose for an hour while snuggled up with your girlfriend? Recently I met some of his friends for the first time and he kept on doing it while we were all driving to a show. Some of them were so bad and no one said anything and I’m just screaming inside and trying to smell my hairspray to get some relief. 

I’m not saying that I want him to stop passing gas. It’s a normal bodily function and my own are deadly as well. But the complete lack of acknowledgment is really bothering me. What is up with this? I worry that it’s a medical condition so I don’t want to hurt him. But I personally find it massively disrespectful. There are times you can hold gas in, but if you can’t then aren’t you supposed to say “excuse me” at the very least? I haven’t done it around him yet but I excuse myself every time I burp in his presence, and they’re little baby burps too. Like roll down the windows if we’re in the car, or go off a few steps while we are standing somewhere (we were in line to pay for something at the mall and I just had to pretend to browse to get away from the smell multiple times). If we’re cuddled up then say something and push me away, don’t hold me closer as you poison my air. 

I’ve spoken to my mother about it and our family therapist, but they both have the same racial and cultural background as me and are from an older generation. In my family we can’t even say the normal f word for passing gas, it’s considered vulgar and impolite. They find it completely disrespectful but I can’t tell if what we think is in line with current societal norms. I might be old fashioned or just overly sensitive. This is all so new to me and I’m an anxious autistic so I have no idea how to address this. My anxiety is going to absurd lengths like wondering if he has no sense of smell (I don’t think he’s ever commented on my perfume and I try to wear different ones. I don’t care but I noticed) or has an embarrassing medical condition that his friends know about so they avoid bringing it up. Does anyone have any advice? 

Also, we are about to go away for the weekend for the first time and what if he gasses up the hotel room???",OurLadyOfSparkles,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b4gsa/my_bf_passes_gas_a_lot_and_i_dont_know_how_to/,1690470752.0,0.71
"My unexpectedly casual fling with Mrs. Right I am (21m), and she is (19f). For context, I met this girl on Tinder a week prior, and this was our first time meeting. I pulled up to her house, and I grabbed the door of my passenger seat for her as we greeted each other. We proceeded to my friend's place for a kickback. After a little bit of icebreakers and a couple drinks (she doesn't drink), we sat down with my friends and played some games for a while. Slowly, the party died down, and my friend who owns the house headed to bed while she and I watched some random ass movie. At this point, I want to mention that she said she didn't want to have sex on a first date, to which I replied, That's completely fine. What was soon to ensue was the complete opposite of that. What started as me lying on her stomach soon turned into me putting my hand around her throat and kissing her lips. We ended up making out, and although I'm not the best kisser, I managed to keep up the heat and then trail off to kiss down her neck to her collar bone. From there, I continued the foreplay and soon got the okay to slide my fingers inside. After a bit of clitoral play and some added pressure from inside, she came. At this point, I was done, honestly. I respected what she said before, but then she hit me with ""I want you inside me""! I was surprised but cautious still. I proceeded to ask her two more times just to make sure she was sure this was something she really wanted. She responded with a breathy ""yes"". So I proceeded to pull out my cock, and I could see a surprised look on her face as she looked at it. At this point, this beautiful girl has me absolutely falling for her, and not just because of the situation I am currently in but because everything about her, from her personality to her looks, is so dorky and hot at the same time. I slid inside, and this was quite an experience because I've never felt such wetness before. Although I hadn't gone all the way in, I could see her eyes roll back through a slit in between her eyelids. After about 30 minutes, she was worn out, and I hadn't finished, although it felt amazing. She asked if there was something wrong, and I explained that it takes me a while to finish, and she was slightly upset that she couldn't return the favor. I assured her that she felt great and that it was just me. I must have flicked a switch because she was ready to go again, and she decided to take control by getting on top. After another 20–30 minutes of hot breath and sweat, I finished inside her. This was a first-time experience for me, so I was just more attracted at this point. After a while of just kissing while she sat on top, we cleaned up and laid down for the night.
~
A day later, after some texting about what we wanted in life and other things of that nature, we decided to hang out at my place and play board games with some music in the background. She also mentioned that she didn't just want to have sex when she came over, and I agreed. After hanging out for a while and talking a little bit more about our past relationships, We realized that we were very similar. I felt like we were connecting way more than we already had the previous night. After we ate, we crawled into bed. Once again, we started to make out, and I continued to please her with foreplay. After that, she once again asked for it, and when she did, I immediately made her confirm rather than jump on the opportunity. She replied, ""Give me that dick"". I could tell this was more aggressive than last time, so I told her to turn and bend over. She did it immediately after I commanded it, with no fuss. It was almost like she knew that I love when women are submissive. We went at it for 30 minutes, and she told me she was tired and couldn't take it any longer. I kissed her forehead and said that it was fine and that I appreciated her effort. We laid down for about an hour, and she started to grind on me. It only took me a couple seconds to get back up to full size, and she immediately Put it back in and pushed back against me as I stroked deep. Soon after, I was filling her up. This was just an amazing feeling. We cleaned up, and in the morning she went to work.
~
We texted through the following day, and her responses started to change. I noticed something was wrong, and I asked her, but she just said it was nothing. Obviously, this meant that it was something. I just didn't want to pry and ruin our relationship. Soon after, I was faced with a response to my question, ""Do you still want to hang out?"" Her response was ""Idk."" I was so hurt that I blocked her and began writing the perfect message to convey my feelings to her. Although I was putting my pride at risk, I had felt that I loved this woman more than my previous 3-year relationship. We had shared that we wanted kids together and to get married. It all just stopped so suddenly, and I needed to explain myself even if she didn't care because it was for me, honestly. I sent her that message two days later.",Successful_Ebb_1662,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bhdb3/my_unexpectedly_casual_fling_with_mrs_right/,1690501448.0,0.67

"Did I set off a red flag? I got into an argument with the gas station clerk because I was charging my phone up and he told me I can’t charge my phone in here. 


Ok, fine. As I started to unplug my phone he starts waking towards me in an aggressive manner and I told him hey get back I’m leaving and we start having a verbal war with one another.  As this is happening his coworker says I’m calling the police and I’m like uhhhh for what you asked me to leave and I’m leaving.

I actually wave them down as I figured they were looking for me. We talked for a bit and he got my side of the story and on my way i went.

But some people aren't any more messed up without therapy than other people are with therapy. For some people, therapy (or at least whatever therapy they have access to) isn't helpful.

"How should I (24M) approach DM’ing this girl (23F) I’m interested in? Hi everyone,

After the most difficult past year of my life, I’ve finally come to terms (and worked through) all that has happened, and am moving forward. This includes revisiting my (admittedly dry) dating live that I stepped away from. Before, I was in a download/delete cycle, but told myself that whenever I revisit dating, I’d try and do it off the apps. Either in person or dming people I’ve been interested in for a while. Granted this last one is still via app, but I suppose different because it seems more “real” (idk how to describe it lol).

Anyways, there’s this girl I followed on IG earlier this year in March. Same hometown, she’s friends with a really close cousin (that’s like a sister), have other mutuals, live in same city now, went to same place for undergrad, and from similar diaspora communities. I think she’s really cute and finally have the courage to initiate things. However, she doesn’t post photos/stories too often. What she posts on her stories isn’t really conducive (in my opinion) to starting a convo; related to some company she works/associates with and I never knew how to try and engage with it (ie, don’t want to shoehorn into shitty conversation lol). 

Until earlier this week, she posted a story of food she was eating with a friend and I liked the story. Things are getting pretty serious (jk haha). I just don’t know how I’d continue from here? Besides liking/trying to respond to such stories that aren’t related to that one company (because idk wtf I’d say). Some people have suggested messaging her just saying hey (others said to say I was thinking about her, but that’s just weird imo). I have a tendency to overthink + an autistic, so a lethal combo lmao. What do y’all think? She always views my stories and liked my photo that I uploaded a few weeks ago. I posted one story 2 days after she saw, but didn’t like. Again, this doesn’t mean anything, but just wanted to give some background. This is already getting long lol. What do y’all think?

"The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband... For purposes of this story, my ex's name is Hannah, her husband is Jeremy and her sister is Amanda (all fake names).
Hannah and I started dating in our senior year of high school. It was great, but lasted about 6 months and ended things about a month before graduation. We kept in scarce contact until about the end of the year when I moved out of state. We didn't talk at all for a couple of years but I knew she had started dating and ultimately married another guy from my facebook feed. When I moved back to our home state, I randomly got a message from Hannah asking if I still liked the same type of stuff. I said I did, and she replied that she knew a girl, Amanda, that ""would be perfect for me"" and offered to go on a double date. I said ok and then she said that it is her sister-in-law. I feel incredibly awkward at this point (I was 21 and not the best in awkward situations) because I already agreed but would rather not go out with her SIL, I had thought it was going to be a friend or something.
So the day of the date comes and I meet Jeremy, Hannah, and Amanda to go see some Christmas lights. Jeremy and Hannah walk off and I'm left alone with Amanda which was the ""best"" part of the date, only because that's when I was the least awkward, but they come back and spend most of the date with Amanda and I. It wasn't a great date by any means (mostly due to me). I felt like I couldn't talk to Amanda with them there. Jeremy and I didn't have anything in common that I could glean from the conversations that I had heard whilst on the date, and I felt like I couldn't talk with Hannah (even though I had no feelings for her at this point, being married and all. I just got along with her best) because that would probably just upset Jeremy and Amanda. Then Hannah and Jeremy offer for everyone to come back to their place for hot chocolate any more conversation, and me being me, agree to go over. More awkwardness ensues and after a bit, I say I better get going and leave for home and finally get to unwind from that shitstorm of awkwardness that just engulfed me those last few hours.
So, yeah, that's the story of how I went on a blind double-date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband (and in case it isn't clear; husband and SIL are siblings).
P.S. During the time we were dating, I knew that Hannah's parents were divorced and she lived with her mom 100%. What I didn't know until after the date was that Jeremy had also lived with a single parent (his dad) and that Hannah and Jeremy's parents married each other (after Hannah and Jeremy were married, not before).
P.P.S. So I guess, technically, I should have titled this: The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL/step-sister, my ex, and her husband/step-brother.

"How Can I Stop Dating App Addiction? I never realized I was addicted to dating apps until I saw a pattern among my friends as well as myself. I need to check my messages every day, a few times a day at least.

When I meet people in person from the dating app, I always keep thinking there is someone else better and I usually find excuses to not want to see that other person again...or vice versa as it happens to me.

If things do go well with someone I meet from a dating app I still feel the need to go on the dating apps and respond to or send new notes to other people.

I noticed in the last 20 years I have bounced around from one dating app to another on and off over a period of those years.  Even if I am with someone in a decent relationship I keep thinking there is something more, it scares me if they want to get too serious, because I seem to want my freedom, but also want to be with someone else at the same time.

"Haven’t went on a date in years. Is it bad that my only hobbies are working out/snowboarding? Can’t think of any date ideas I think this is where I’ve always really struggled when it comes to dating.

I was never really a player or anything, but before, I would never really date; just have them sneak into my parents house for sex. So I don’t feel like I’m the most well versed in the actual “getting to know you” phase of courting someone.

I live in a legal state now, and the very few times I have went on a date, it’s usually just something like “hey let’s smoke and go to the park”. I don’t have many date ideas at all and I’m always kind of afraid of going on dates thinking “oh they’re gonna think this is boring” “she’s probably thinking ‘is this all he can come up with”. 

I feel that it is also worth mentioning that I am kind of a loner. Now, when I have gone out to the bar here (I work at a resort), I’d see other employees I’ve met before and am decent at being social. I go out with coworkers every now and then. But most of the time, I don’t go out. Don’t get me wrong, I do love meeting cool people and talking to people, I just have a hard time initiating anything. If I go out and don’t see anyone I know, I feel insanely uncomfortable and just end up leaving.",Ok-Bookkeeper-9071,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b4v5f/havent_went_on_a_date_in_years_is_it_bad_that_my/,1690471720.0,1.0

Then she asks me to give to her. Given I snuck out of work to go see this chick and get it in and then head back to change. I left my wallet and everything important at work locker. I just have keys license phone and rubbers.
She insisted in giving the roommate money and says won’t meet up until I do I’m literally parked outside her door. And she is texting me back and fourth that roommate wants money threw cash app, Venmo, Apple Pay or cash. At this point my big head is telling me something is off all these places require debit card and bank info so I don’t want to risk that and the cash option that’s usually u give to a hooker and then u get busted like that. I kept on saying I couldn’t but that I was outside to let me in and have fun. 
She said no that not until I set up a cash app and pay her roommate. So I said thank you and left. And she still wants me to come back but won’t let me in until I pay the 30 to roommate.

"Tinder date of 3 months - need advice Hey there reddit! 

So I need some advice, sorry in advance for the long post.

Like I never did the dating thing properly before and I don't really know the dos and donts, especially if it comes to American dating habits. 

So a little background. We matched about 3 months ago on Tinder. He (33/Texan) and me (33f/German).

Apparently being Texan is a big thing because with it comes a lot of old school habits like: a girl should never touch a bill or a door handle... Well I'm german, I feel bad if he's paying for it all the time, but love the door handle thing. Anyway that's not the point, even If it counts into it a little. 

Back to the story:

So we went on our first date: first going for a walk with my dog, going to dinner after and having 2/3  drinks. It was amazing we linked really well and I took him back to mine. Well things got a little heated, he ate me out like a starved man and left with the words ""I'm trying to be good right now"". 

Well that was that. Things took a sexual turn ever since, we go still on dates on Saturdays usually but I do stop by for a night of sex thru the week usually. The sex is great, he's not what I'm going for usually, which is new to me but I like it and he's blowing my mind sexually. Also I'm not the cuddly type usually but turns out I can be a snuggle monster if treated right.

So we do cutesy shit, like he cooks, we do the bathing together relax thing, I get t shirts, he gets panties left behind, period sex, it's all very relationshippy to me. But we never actually talked about where this is supposed to go. I mean we seem to be exclusive, he fucking adores my body, sex is amazing etc. All great. But I don't know him well enough to go down the relationship path. You know what I mean ? Like if we together it's great there are no sec. thoughts but when I'm back out of the bubble it's like, hmm who am I and what is this?

So I need advice about dating habits and if this is me sliding right into a relationship I'm not yet ready for. Or if I'm overthinking shit again and should just go with the flow and it will present itself at some point.

"Is this ""ghosting""/rude? Hi all - sort of a silly question of semantics around the definition of ghosting - bear with me:

\- Say you go on three dates with someone - nothing happens beyond a polite kiss goodbye after date 2 and 3

\- They leave town for a week for work

\- When they get back, YOU leave town for a week for vacation

\- When you get back in to town, you reach out to them to make plans.  They respond that ""it's really busy this week but lets reconnect next week""

\- They do not reach out the next week to reconnect, and you don't hear from them again.  You also don't reach out again because you already did once, and it seems like they won't at this point and are just not interested.  Oh well!  You move on.

In either case, settle a debate - is this being ""ghosted""?  Or this is just a casual dating relationship that naturally faded out?

"How to navigate an early relationship if I want a commitment? We've been dating a month and a half now. Things have been great, aside from this weekend (I will get to that below)... We started off strong, though he started off lying to me about just getting out of something with his ex. She started messaging me the first week of us dating (I guess she saw that he and I were friends on IG)... Basically, he had just paid her rent (she claimed they lived together and she wanted him off her lease but he said he is not on her lease and I believe him) and he just bought her a sofa. She also sent me screenshots of another girl saying he was ""playing house with her 2 months ago"" ... based on that, I already knew the ex's timeline didn't add up (they just met this past January and he and I started dating in June, so how was he living with her and playing house with someone in April...) Either way, all of the drama made me very skeptical and even when things would be going well, I would express my doubt to him. For instance, I brought up to him late one night after a night out that I think he's dishonest because he's always at my place but has NEVER invited me over his. In that same moment, he told me to get up and get dressed. He took me to where he lived, with his grandmother, which reassured me. We spend a lot of time together (at least 5 days a week and he sleeps over). This past weekend wasn't good for us, though. Kind of a bump in the road... we went out to bars with his friends and kind of did not get along. Definitely a mixture of drinking and probably overdoing the festivities. 

On Sunday I ended up telling him I wanted to take a step back because the weekend left me with a terrible feeling-- Friday, I got drunk and argued with him and when he walked away in anger to calm down, it alarmed me so drunk me thought it was a good idea to call his ex and ask if his behavior was normal. I hung up before she answered and apologized to her for calling. I told him I called her and he was upset but we didn't dwell on it. Saturday, we had an outing at the park and had a wonderful time, then he wanted to go meet his friends at a bar. We went and he was basically limiting my drinks-- understandably so because I acted a fool the night before. I had a bit of an attitude so he went to the bar to get me a glass of sparkling wine with his friend, who was getting his date a drink. This guy was trying to flirt with me when he came back and he got upset with me and basically ignored me for the next 30 minutes. Really rubbed me the wrong way. Sunday morning when we woke up, I just thought it was too much and I wanted to spend my day alone. He insisted he come with me to run errands though, so we stayed together. Later on while we were watching a movie, he just seemed so distant. I was relieved when he had to go pick up his friend. That's when I told him we should distance ourselves. He assured me he wanted this and was afraid of losing this and wasnt going anywhere so I said, okay no need for the distance, but he agreed two days would do us some good. We saw each other again yesterday and just watched a movie, and I was surprised when he wanted to leave after because he usually stays the night. When he left I asked him where his head was and he said nothing has changed and that we're just getting past a bad weekend. 

I would really like some advice on how to proceed in a healthy manner. I really like this guy and I want him to want to commit. On Sunday we were watching a movie and he said something like ""a man knows within the first week if he wants to commit to someone."" Should I take that as a red flag since its been a month and a half or should I just trust his actions (consistent contact and effort and always wanting to see me)?

"What’s all the fuss about prenups? Just came across a post about prenups and it had me thinking. I’ve always intended to get a prenup when I get married. Long story short, I’m an only child and so I’ll be inheriting from my parents one day. Not that I wouldn’t trust a partner, but you really never know what could happen in the future and I feel It is my responsibility to protect whatever I’d be inheriting from my parent’s hard work. Not to mention, it would also protect my partner’s income and I believe that to be fair.

"I'm in love with my ex, and I love my boyfriend, but I'm not in love with him. This is really long because there's a lot to explain so I'm really sorry. 
For the sake of privacy and having no confusion, we'll call my ex salad and my boyfriend forklift. Random names that correspond with them.

Backstory on my ex:
We met when I started working at a restaurant. He was the salad/fry cook, and I started as a dishwasher. I always found him to be pretty cute, but didn't really have any feelings for him or at least didn't realize that I did, until I worked my first double. We have a thing that he does with jar lids. He can fold them in half by squeezing them in one hand. Hard-core grip strength. And then I would unfold them, make them look nice again. He does this, and I get the idea to turn it into a heart shape. He had to help me with this. I wrote inside, something like ""you're doing great"", just something positive. For a while, he had it hanging on the fridge in his station. We became friends on Facebook, started talking more. And on mother's day in 2022, confessed feelings for each other over text while at work. This was the beginning of something that would tear me into shreds later on. We started seeing each other, sleeping together. But kept it ""private"", it was secret. No one could know. He didn't have a girlfriend or anything, but we worked together and didn't want coworkers in our business. However, no one knew that he was seeing ANYONE. He literally kept it entirely secret. Fast forward to July. He had given me a key to his apartment, I had face wash and moisturizer in his showers, lingerie in his bedroom. It was my second home. We had a mutual coworker who had just quit, we'll call her airplane. Airplane was pretty and skinny, but she was quirky and annoying. She confided in me that she had feelings for Matt. Me, being stupidly loyal, told her I didn't think he was seeing anyone. Then they start talking. She sends me screenshots all the time of their conversations, asking if I think he likes her. I'm always very vague but it seemed perfectly friendly at first. Until it wasn't. Until he was flirting. He tried to say he was just being friendly, but it sunk me. In late july, they both went offline at the same time and stayed offline. This was unusual because salad was pretty active on Facebook and I knew he wasn't at work. So I shoot airplane a text, asking how she's doing. She tells me she's hanging out and cuddling with salad. And then that he kissed her. I text salad and tell him I'll be getting my things the next day, and I don't want to talk to him again. However, we were coworkers. So we tried to be friends and make nice. I was also head over heels for him. He was the first person I'd been able to commit to in years. We end up hooking up again. But he's still not ready for a commitment or something. So we argue, and I block him. Now enters my current boyfriend. 

Boyfriend's backstory:
He is my best friend's boyfriend's brother. That's how we met. I always thought he was cute. In semptember, he gets drunk and admits he has feelings for me. I say I wouldn't mind talking. We talk for a bit and start dating. Things were going great for about a month, until he gets drunk and yells he doesn't love me and never could. We break up, he apologizes, we get back together. This went on for a couple more months, alcohol always being the source of our problems. We've been off and on since, and we're currently on. I do love him, but he doesn't make me feel the way salad does. Ever. Sex is boring with him, whereas salad does lots of different things to stimulate me. I still talk to salad, we slept together right before forklift and I got back together. I told forklift he'd have to cut way down on the drinking if this was gonna work. It seems like he has, but he still drinks beer like water. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not being fair to Forklift because I can never truly love him the way I love Salad. But I don't think Salad will ever want anything more than the occasional hookup from me. Does anyone have advice? 


Other info that may be relevant: 
Salad is 8 years older than me. 
Forklift is 6 years older than me. 
I am of legal age, and I have a great relationship with my father, just like older guys.

"One heartbreak after another 6 months with my first partner were some of the greatest and happiest moments of my life. We broke up 7 months ago and I was absolutely shattered to the core. Now, I 21M met this other person 21F who I was interested in for around a month. Turns she was really into me and she showed a lot of interest in me which I’ve never felt before. I was later quite addicted to this feeling of being wanted that I made a shitty decision which you’ll read in a moment. After a great first date at an ice rink, she made it clear that all she wanted was a casual relationship, nothing with a future possibility of something long term as she was an international student. I was once again heartbroken, so I called it off. Quite convincingly too. A few hours later, I call back changing my mind while giving her shitty reasons like “I too want something casual” when all I wanted was the feeling of being wanted. This was the shitty decision which ultimately drove her away as she ended things a few days later. 

Although we’re still in touch, this girl doesn’t even show the same enthusiasm as she did before. In fact, she’s quite dry texting. The fact that I went back to her after making a strong choice, showed her I was desperate which ultimately ended things.

Now, I feel really devastated after this ordeal. All I want is to enjoy my summer with someone. I don’t want anything long term atm because I’m not mature enough for it yet and I just want something casual with some commitment because I’m going into my final year of university and I just want intimacy after being starved for so long. I just wanna be held man

"One of my best friends just found out her husband asked me out a few years ago and had a crush on me, now she's acting like she doesn't want to talk to me I have a friend group through my son's school (I'm a single mom). I consider these really close friends of mine and we hang out a lot and have dinner parties and movie night. I mentioned to them that I'd like to start dating again and what I'm looking for - I'm a single mom so dating has been really hard for me the last few years. One of my closest friends said her husband (let's call him John) knows tons of eligible bachelors at work. This guy John works at a big tech company (think Google, FB, Amazon) and is very well to do and so I liked the idea of meeting his friends. I was out to lunch with my female friend and asked her to ask her husband to try to set me up with some coworkers. We got to talking and I mentioned I would like to meet a guy like her husband, ""I missed the boat with him"". She asked what I meant and I told her John had asked me out a few years prior in a completely different setting and it wasn't the right time for dating back then and I turned him down. She immediately had a look of horror on her face like I had told her that her mother had died. She got quiet and just asked ""what?"". I told her that John and I had met through a volunteer organization a few years back and he made a pass at me and she asked ""why did you turn him down?"". She seemed upset all of the sudden. I tried to explain to her I wasn't really dating at the time and wasn't interested. Every since our chat my friend has been ignoring me, at least from what I can tell. I texted her asking if John can introduce me to some of his coworkers and she just texted back ""I don't think so"". I don't understand why this information was so difficult for her to process and what I did wrong. I've been single for a very long time and would love to start dating again, especially with some of the guys like her husband but she seems totally put off that her husband had asked me out a few years back.

"29 and still single. How do I turn my dating life around? So I turned 29 earlier this year and since then I've been in a major self loathing and self pitying phase. 

For the longest time I believed (and still believe)that I'm too unattractive to date but I don't think that's correct. I have no facial deformations, I go to the gym regularly, keep up with my grooming and wear clothes that fit me well. I have a nice group of friends and hobbys. Also I never talked to a lot of women. So my only evidence for this thought are a few bad experiences in my early twenties.

I think my main problem (besides my negative self image) is, that I don't go out a lot. So I don't meet any women. But just going to bars and clubs isn't really an option. I don't like those places and feel quite uncomfortable there.

"should I tell him how I feel? 
hi, i’ve recently run into a situation with the guy I really like/am talking to (?) that I would like some advice on. 

I met this guy about a month before the end of my first year at college. He drove down from a city about an hour away to come visit me on campus. We really hit it off, we talked for hours, smoked, watched a movie, got takeout, and talked some more. He visited me again about two weeks later, before I left to go home for the summer. He took me out to dinner and we had another wonderful time together, we really connected and explored town/talked until the late hours of the night. We laughed about how we were shocked we met on Tinder and ended up connecting this much. He kissed me at the end, and said he’d like to stay in touch, he even offered to have me travel up to the summer camp he works at over the summer. 

We’ve been texting and exchanging memes and stuff all summer, and I’ve been so excited to see him again in the Fall, but we’re not official. 
Yesterday he called me to check in and chat, which was really nice. We laugh so easily with each other and seem to get each other really well. 
This is where the dilemma comes in. 
He told me his scholarship for his college in the city by mine wasn’t renewed, so he isn’t returning in the Fall. :( I was really sad, but I didn’t really show it outside of saying it was a bummer, which he apologized for but I assured him it wasn’t his fault. He said he may look at other colleges in the same state, but also mentioned another state as a possibility. 
I want to tell him I want to stay in touch with him regardless of where he ends up, and that I really like him and would love to see him again at some point, But I don’t know if that’s too much or not.

"What should I do..? Me (24, f) been dating this guy (26, M) for at least almost 12 years now. We've been in a LDR and so far everything was great until this year I've notice he barely spend time with me which is I understand. We all have life outside of this relationship.

But what's bothering me is that I literally asked just for a 5 mins call and he can't even give it to me. I have busy time too where I can't open my phone and check socmed and I understand that we all have different way.. But I'm literally asking for bare minimum and he seems to be just cutting me off which is never happened to me like ever. He has a lot of time to play video games and read novel (which is I do the same thing too but at least I make time for him) He's my source of happiness and just hearing and seeing him for like 5 mins can make my day.. I just don't understand why even 5 mins is already feel like a chores to him. 

I kept confronting him like maybe he's messing around and just waiting for me to just give up and ask for break up and the last thing he said ""Don't be like this, don't think like this"" I keep asking him if he's cheating since how the hell would I know if he's far away from me? We only do video call and the only respond I get is ""I never cheated on you, I never broke my promises""

I never see posts about guys who date women where they know they can do better, or women who feel horrible knowing their man could dump them at any time.I have always had girlfriends where people look at me like ""dude, that's who you're with? Come on man you're better than that"". I end up dumping them and it's nasty. I feel extremely alone, emasculated, and worthless because I can't find people who relate.

But now this new relationship he’s very independent, we see eachother twice a week, when we are not together we only send a few text messages a day and because he works etc he does take hours to reply which I’m not used to… I’m struggling to feel connected with him and time spent apart even a few days it feels like I’m not even in a relationship. He’s very relaxed let’s me go party, go away without him, he checks up on me at the end of the day but through the day and evening we don’t speak that much 
When we are together we talk loads but he’s very much mature and intelligent and I feel dumb against him… 
I don’t feel like I would moan or tell him how I feel I’m struggling to feel connected and close with him and I don’t wanna moan and put him off so I feel a bit alone really….

I know he likes me as he wants to spend nearly everyday together and I have met his kid, but there’s not much in the way of being there for me on an emotional level or even really returning the care and love I’ve been giving. I’ve been feeding him and his dog almost every lunch and dinner and helping him out with some things like giving him rides to the airport, doing laundry, watching his dog, and taking care of him on his bad days at work and it’s gotten to a point where I feel like I’ve been pouring a lot of love and effort into someone and I’m feeling empty myself - there is more that he is taking than he is giving back.

"Is two days too late to text a girl back? How does texting even work? Hello, good people of arr-dating. I'm back here for advice.

I (23M) ended up texting a girl (a few years older than me, F), who I think *might* like me back, over a work-related platform. She didn't immediately file a restraining order which I think is a good sign. Problem is, every time I look at the ensuing conversation, I get a different vibe from her:

&amp;#x200B;

Points for no:

* Our conversation is pretty impersonal for the most part, though I'm not sure how to quantify this.
* Her responses are pretty short and she's asked one question back so far. That was her one attempt to continue the conversation.
* We've exchanged a total of nine messages so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Points for yes:

* She texts back almost instantly. Every time. Even when I took half a day to text her back.
* Her responses are short but not dismissive. Seems to me that she's just a bad texter. As far as I can tell, English is also her second language, so that might be part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a pretty strong no to me. I've stopped bugging her.

However, I've been told it's common for some girls to not ask questions back and expect you to continue the conversation on your own. That's what our dynamic (which, I'll admit, is a strong word to use here) was in real life too. She's very quiet and I'm not. She hasn't gone past work-stuff, but I also never asked for fear of being weird. I've talked about my own life (once) instead and she never reciprocated. Again, strong ***no*** vibes, but people say this is par for the course.

I stopped talking to her because I figured she wasn't interested, and it's been about two days since, but I keep getting this nagging feeling that I'm seeing a rejection that isn't there. It's an old habit of mine. On the other hand, I don't want to be the guy that can't take hints. If she's not interested, I'll gladly leave her alone and drown my sorrows.

"Dating perspective, or advice, from men needed! Hello! I’m an early 30s young widow (childless). It’s not common, I know. I’m not exactly sure how guys in their 30s+ feel about this status of mine but it is what it is. If you have an opinion, great, please share! 

But. I recently downloaded Hinge and the area that I live in is a suburb so it’s a hit or miss sometimes on the options. 

I’m interested to see what different things about women men are really looking for in their 30s? I know it can be heavily preference based. 

I have a great career and education, loyal group of friends, family oriented, open to children, self-aware, and I’m active. I’ve been told I’m really easy to get along with and trustworthy. My ability to be a present and devoted partner is something I’m extremely proud of. What else would I highlight when talking? 

I do get asked why I’m single by the men on apps and I feel like answering that I am a widow is kind of jarring to hear. So then I had it on my profile and the likes dropped… lol. So I’m not sure how to approach that one. I don’t want anyone to feel like 1. I’m single so something must be wrong with me or 2. They have to be what my late husband was. 

My friend suggested that men might think they can’t offer me anything because I am completely on my own but idk about that - I disagree. They can. I’m genuinely looking to date and see what’s there. 

Any advice you guys have would be appreciated as I navigate the dating jungle! Thank you in advance :)",PressSnoozeAlways,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b8cp4/dating_perspective_or_advice_from_men_needed/,1690479923.0,1.0
"I am deeply regretting telling her the truth. How do I make her calm down?! I just started dating a girl and told her that I had a thing going on with someone else while we met, but after the first week together with her I broke up with a previous girl. Our energy just did not match and I feel alot better with a current girl... 

Now she is going crazy and thinks that she might have caught some kind of STI from me (I am 99% sure me previous girl was clean and before her I did a test) and worried that I might dump her like I did with the previous woman after I met her. What do you guys suggest I do? How do I make her calm down?

I was just telling the truth when she asked me if I am also sleeping with someone else. Now I am deeply regretting telling her.


Edit: People keep saying I was in a relationship or exclusive and was cheating. I had nothing official going on before and felt sour with the previous girl already on our last two dates.  The new girl who I had real connection with just made it clearer

When I say current girl was going “crazy” it was just a expression. Trust me I have dealt with crazy and she is not like that.

Thank you everyone who has some brains and actually gave me some positive feedback this is highly appreciated. Big thanks to your help we are getting together tomorrow and fixing things:)

For the one’s who say I get what I deserve for sleeping around, you probably do not understand what dating is like in your 20s so it is better to not say anything if it’s negative…",ittask,204,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15a4v15/i_am_deeply_regretting_telling_her_the_truth_how/,1690375457.0,0.78

"Dating app recommendations? Honestly, I don’t really know why I even fuck with dating apps anymore. Most people are fake. Anyway, I work a lot and I’m also a home body so my chances of finding someone naturally are practically nonexistent. Im also dumb enough to want to be In love and share life with a partner, and not looking for love makes me uneasy.

It’s not that I have issues getting matched with people. I’m a young female, successful and decently good looking. 

My experience so far:
Tinder - I’ve had some kinda success with this app. I feel like more people are looking for hookups though.. my fuck girl days are over lol and I want more meaningful connections.

Coffee Meet Bagel- honestly this app is a hit or miss. I met my last long term partner on this app and we dated for almost 2 years before realizing we wouldn’t be compatible in the long run. Haven’t had any success after that, just a lot of men in committed relationships/open marriages looking for a 3rd (I’ve also tried this, not really my thing).

Bumble- never had any success with bumble. It’s been a few years and I feel like the quality of people on bumble is directly related to where you live…? I’m a traveling nurse and sometimes live in the boonies while on assignment.

PoF- let be honest, when has this app EVER been quality? Maybe it’s changed over the years but I’m not hopeful.

Hinge- has turned into more of a fuckboy community over the years. I’ve had minor success with this app.

I feel like this hits the big apps but anyone have any other recommendations?

I’m also also experimenting with my sexuality so, definitely open to less mainstream and more queer friendly options.",Neat-Ad2904,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b1wrr/dating_app_recommendations/,1690464464.0,1.0
"Not fully sure where people(women) my age tend to hang out.  For context I'm 28M. I live in SWFL. I've been rolling solo since for a whole now.  One of the biggest struggle I've had since moving here 7 years ago is the amount of older folk in the area vs  anyone who's somewhat close to my age.    I'm still just at a lost on where to I should be hanging out to have a better chance at stumbling across  those who seem my age.   I would say most the people are 45+. And most being around that retirement age.  I dont think I've had a proper random conversation  with anyone under the age of 40 so far this year(  work not included).  

 I am the introverted type who  doesnt always know what to do to open up more. I've never step foot into a crowded bar or club. As I struggle with loud music/lights/bumping into people and so I do ussally make a point to even try on like a friday or Saturday  night( work nights any way)   I do get sundays for free time but everywhere I kinda go is chill but always just filled with older folks. You know when I have the free time. 

Am I just being dumb about the situations?. I am on the spectrum  so I know  I can be pretty naive  about basic things at times. I just dont even know what people around my age are even doing or are into  that's around my age.   Find places where it mainly 20s and 30s flusters me.  I only seem to see children,teen,parents and older folks but cant seem to pick out people my age.   

  Just for context  meetup.com had over 10 active options for people 45+   the only active 20s,30s group is  a over an hour drive because it's for a different area altogether.  The closest mall that isnt dead is 45 mins, beaches alere an hour or 2 depending.  Semi rural

"My (19F) bf (22M) liked a tiktok video of a girl dancing provocatively right behind me Just like the title says, it's kind of wild to me how he did it. We were in his bedroom, he was sitting on his bed (behind me) scrolling on tiktok. I was busy putting away my stuff since I was going to sleep with him that night, and I heard the audio from the tiktok repeating from his phone. 

I'm quite familiar with the audio since I've seen girls posting their sexy dances with it, so I turned around to him and by this time he already scrolled away from it. I asked what video was he watching earlier, he hesitated so I scrolled up on his phone and I was right afterall. It was in fact a girl dancing sexily and guess what, he liked the tiktok. There goes the classic excuses of 'liking everything he sees' or the 'accidentally liked'.

I'm wondering if it really is a small matter since he asked me if I'm really mad over that small thing. But the more I think about how he literally liked the video while I was in the same room as him, right in front of his eyes, only facing away from him, the more miserable my mind gets.

That's not all, he lied about a lot of things after I went  through his phone (with permission since he told me his password confidently). And there's always nonsense explanation to each of it which I don't believe at all. Did I mention I found out that his Instagram is filled with girls that resembles his ex (a muslim) but only half naked on his homepage? There's like a hundred of them too. 

I'm starting to think I should leave since he and his family was pressuring me to get engaged with him while he's got all of these going on. I'm gonna confront him about all of these soon, but before I do I just wanted to know what do you guys think of these type of dudes anyways?

I (23m) would like to develop meaningful platonic relationships with women but I find myself getting attached and catching feelings as soon as we get somewhat close. I then end up thinking they're ""the one"" and it's not healthy at all. It usually ends up ruining the friendship although I am very respectful of boundaries and try to communicate as healthily and respectfully as possible about mine and their feelings and what the relationship is. I eventually end up losing those feelings after we have communicated about the nature of the relationship. And I usually end up getting those feelings for someone else as soon as that happens and the cycle continues. I still remain friends with some women that this has happened with but not as close as I would like to be with them even platonically. I understand this isn't very healthy which is why I am asking for advice.

Is she fishing for attention or is she interested? I (26m) met this super beautiful girl (25f) on hinge just over a month ago turns out we went to the same high school and grew up in the same area and have a bunch in common. We seemed to get a along really well over text but I had to put off going out with her as I was super busy since my sister was getting married and had family in town. When we did make plans she ended up canceling on me and saying “I’m putting a pause on dating to focus on work and family right now” I have heard this a bunch and wasn’t really fazed by it but what caught me by suprise is that she keeps responding to my Instagram stories and usually when she does we end up having a conversation. I can’t figure out if she’s interested again or if she just wants to be friends or if she just wants some attention? I figure I will let this continue for at least another month before I ask her out again but am I crazy for thinking that she might be interested again?

I really just want someone to hang out with. I feel sad and I don't have anyone to give to, by no means do I need someone to ""fix me"" or validate me or help me overcome any insecurities cause I've done that all myself. But I just don't want to be alone when I get home anymore. I want someone to look forward to hanging out with, I've tried dating apps and getting out but it just leads to hookups and short term fwb type stuff. I don't know how to deal with this really, I'm in no way a romantic due to my inexperience and people honestly just find me really obnoxious. It's a front in a way but no one wants to actually get to know me and all the girls I've talked to are in relationships or taken by other guys with more experience. If there's one insecurity I have it's that, can't really help it though because if I try to come across as ""smooth"" I just think it sounds cringe and kind of creepy. I dunno what to do, I have so much love to give but no one wants it. Im having a lot of fun in life and I want someone to be a part of that with me. It's a weird spot because most single guys want relationships to ease their insecurity or make them happy in a way.

"Trying to meet this girl, but she is giving mixed signals I'm 25 male, had this breakup 6 months ago. Months ago I noticed this girl exchanging glances with me at the gym, but everytime we look at each other, she tends to look away. I think she is so so so attractive, but didn't felt ready to engage at friendship or anything else cause I was dealing with the breakup. Now I feel so much better and ready to try meet new people and she's top 1 in my mind right now, but we barely chit chat on elevator last week and take turns lifting. Few days after, in gym again, we saw each other while I was leaving and she was entering. I tried to look at her and say something but she pretend she didn't see me (we were very close). Now, when at gym, I avoid to look at her cause I don't want her to feel uncomfortable. But I really do think she is a shy person, and this could explain why she does look away sometimes, as when we did chat, she seemed at least interested. I'm confused cause I don't want to miss the chance to get to know her (for a friendship at least), but I don't want her to feel awkward as well and she is giving mixed signals (in my opinion).  
  
I personally don't think the gym it's the appropriate place to start flirting with someone, cause when I'm working out, I don't like to be bothered, so I don't bother her as well.

After a while of not seeing me, he parked his car down the street, physically got out, walked to the apartment complex, through the gate and was spying on my vehicle.

This really scared me. Is this stalking? I literally saw him earlier that day. I confronted him on camera asking why he is following me. He had been drinking. He couldn’t get his story straight.

I‘m super confused. I (f32) was dating this guy (m39) for about 10 months when he ended it due to personal issues. I accepted it and it was all fine.
We work together (different departments) so we still see each other. Although we were both away and havent seen each other or been in contact at all for the past 6 weeks. Radio silence.

Anyway, today we saw each other for the first time and he seems to try to avoid me like I‘m the pest. And I honestly don’t get it. We were fine before the contact period and I expected „normal“ behaviour at work. Like the colleagues we were. 
And now that? That kind of threw me today. Caught him staring at me from the distance once, but that’s it. He seemed normal with everyone else…

So when I see that the man still appears to be looking on his end it makes me feel horrible. Not good enough. Just venting here. I hate dating in this era. I really wasn’t made for it.

Edit: I’m still proceeding with this man to see if he still puts effort in and still wants to see me and if anything moves forward. He currently still is putting effort at the moment. BUT there will definitely be a conversation and I won’t let it go for long if I feel like he’s just stringing me along and there’s this continuous behavior on social media lol.

"Girl hasnt contacted me after our second date. Basically ended up back at my place on the couch listening to music. Me and the girl were making out. I was really turned on at this point and wanted to have sex really bad, so I stopped kissing and said to her ""I think youre so hot , what do you want to do now?"" she said ""i dont know?"" I said told her thats okay went back to kissing. We make out for another 5 minutes or so and I try to be a bit more direct this time and I say ""is it okay if I touch you"" she says ""okay"" so I start touching her body but not her breasts or anywhere because my question was a bit vague. She starts to touch and rub my leg aswell. Im crazy turned on by this girl at this point. I pretty much am going to explode and really want to have sex so bad so I think to myself fuck it Im asking her, and I say ""do you want to have sex?"" she looks down and replies softly ""i dont know"" I tell her I respect that and continue to makeout. I dont want to be pushy and ask again for sex so I eventually stop making out because I think its probably too soon for her.

Anyway we hang out for another hour or so on the couch just talking and getting to know each other better and cuddling a bit. Anyway she went home and now its been about 1 week and she hasnt responded to my messages.Was I too pushy for the sex? Did my eagerness turn her off?

"Opinions please… Hi all,

So I met a girl a few weeks ago at a party and we hit it off straight away. Chemistry was all there and spent all night together. She insisted to get my number from me before she got into a taxi home.

Later I decide to follow up and ask her out. She ignored the request and replied with how late it was and getting home with it being light already.
I left this and she later replied again to say that she was busy all weekend and ‘maybe next week’

So I left it for half a day and then offered the Tuesday. 
I then get a reply saying she is not looking to date and her head isn’t in the right place but could still meet up sometime. The next day I was out in town and happened to see her with another guy… I immediately knew what this looked like. 

A few days of us not talking, she offers to meet for a coffee on the weekend. I accept.
The next day I get another message asking if I wanted to join her to a party the day before the coffee. I also accept this and go with zero expectations.

This time it’s even better or so I thought….
She admitted to me about her head being all over the place but a few weeks ago decided to date a guy from a dating app but realised she actually liked him after 3 dates. 
As the conversation progressed she leaned in to kiss me and we did.. mostly all night. Saying how good the chemistry is etc and she said she didn’t expect it to go this well with me. 

I explained my position of not wanting to be involved unless I date her and not after casual.(learnt my lessons)

Before she dropped me off (she didn’t drink at all)  - she said… We can sleep together and it may or may not lead to us dating.
I said no to this but she insisted I think about it and she will think about her situation on dating.

She also decides coffee the next day isn’t such a good idea but her words “it’s not a no like that it’s just I need to think” 
“Not saying no in the future”

She goes cold with me the next day.
The following day I take a last ditch shot and ask to meet-up.
I am then greeted with a “my situation has changed and I am looking to date and see where it leads” (with the other guy).

I’ve replied and said I understand and to take care. I don’t know if he’s a rebound or what. 

She then said “we have great chemistry and I’m sorry it’s not something we can explore right now”.

Wtf?! 

I know the right thing is to move on and not look back but ffs the chemistry was off the charts. Anyone at both events commented that we either looked a couple or should be.

Part of me doesn’t want to let go of the idea. It sucks.

"Work crushes? (Just reflecting back - doing a lot of reflecting &amp; evaluating - can’t take action but am making plans for if when I can in the future.)

Ok so, I was thinking back to work crushes.  How much if any action to take there or is it a no go zone?

It’s rare I’ve had them as I’ve mostly worked with women &amp; straight women at that but have had the odd crush. 

Is it different if it’s the main job?
Compared to it it’s a holiday job?
Or a once a month side job?

What would you do? 

Again, it may be me being dense, someone said “I know some good” (I don’t remember what it was maybe some kind of self help thing rather than an event) if you’re interested”

Should I have said “I’d love to know more could we swap numbers?”
Again, I assumed I’d see her again (I can crush on both) 
I really got a sense she liked me back or at a minimum as a friend but also maybe more. 
With the guy, I didn’t really have an opening like that, except for him saying where else he worked.  Also got a vibe from him too that it was mutual.

Another time it was a guy crush but I only saw him once a month.  I was feeling so shy too. So I talked a bit some lunch times and that was it.

And at the main job when it’s every day what do you do then when you see them every day even if it goes wrong?

I did date a couple of guys kinda at a work &amp; study place once &amp; sometimes it felt awkward if things ended? 

Thoughts?

Keep em separated?
Outta bounds?

Or maybe another place to find connections?

"Messaging turned sexual way too early, and I’m not interested anymore. This guy is weirding me out. Should I ghost or block cold turkey or should I fade slowly? On Tinder, this guy’s intro message was “if all jobs paid the same, what would you do?” For some reason, I just didn’t respond for at least a few days, maybe a week. Then he sent another message, “hmm I guess I should just try ‘hey’ like everyone else.” At first for a few days, I was thinking I should just ignore it, but looked at his pictures again, then I gave in lol. I guess I thought it was a funny thing to say. From now on, I’m not replying to those who send a message after an intro implying they’re wondering why I never responded. So for the last few days, we’ve just been messaging each other. He’s said a few times “I’m feeling so much better now that I’m talking to you” or “I had a bad day today, but now talking to you helps.” And he’s seeming needy, seems extra eager for me to respond soon. I was on the fence before if I wanted to video chat with him, but last night he played a question game with me and I knew the third question was just leading to something sexual. And it did. I played along. We were sort of sexting. No pictures, just more explicit messages. I have to admit it was fun going back and forth with him for a couple hours until 1am, conversing and talking dirty, but at the end of the day, I’m looking for something serious and this guy doesn’t seem to be. I’m not meeting him, even virtually. He seems too intense and is honestly weirding me out. For some reason, I’m just feeling anxious. What should I do? Should I fade slowly or ghost cold turkey? He even expressed a message, saying “I’m afraid you’ll ghost me if you know what music I listen to.” He sent a few songs and I jokingly said “I’m ghosting you” and he sent a meme saying “please no” and deep down I am not joking, and am actually feeling a bit anxious.

"Need some tips on my little situation. (Dating/social skills) Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I’ve recently started talking to this girl, she’s 28, I’m 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we’re probably more friends than anything else.
We’ve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn’t help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I’m shy and I can’t really find anything to talk about that we’d have in common. She’s a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can’t be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it’ll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it’s because she didn’t talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15aymwx/need_some_tips_on_my_little_situation/,1690455052.0,1.0

"Is he dating his baby mother or me after everything? 
I met someone at my first ever job. I’m 22 and he’s 33. He’s got a baby mum and two kids (7 and 3/4), he stays at their house together and states he sleeps on the sofa.

He never mentioned his situation until after we slept together, he then proceeds to say that he thought I knew as everyone at work knew. I carried on believing that he was single as he’d reassure me but then someone at work said they saw him with his baby mum hugging and kissing her which he denied outright. Then he went on holiday with her for the kids and said he didn’t want to upset the kids as he booked it when they were together, he stated that he got a single room. When he was on holiday I asked him and he said there was a problem with the single room so he’s in the same room but they split the beds. If I hadn’t asked he wouldn’t have mentioned it and I’m going off the fact that he was there for a couple of days. He won’t even tell me his baby mums first name, he goes why do you want to know but I don’t understand if he is single then why is he so secretive. 

He told me he’s in love with me and he has never felt this way about anyone. He treated my like I’m special and important, he told me that I act really mature for my age. He was caring and attentive. He was funny and sweet. He told me I’m the prettiest girl he’s ever been with, he states that I’m an upgrade from his baby mum etc.

I fell pregnant and he threatened suicide and guilt tripped me into getting an abortion stating that having kids ruins your body, I am destined for better things etc. He made me feel bad by stating that I’m trying to baby trap him etc. Long story short I got the abortion. 

He always came to my place, I live alone and I only know what area he lives in, he knows so much about my life and I barely know anything about his. 

He said he needs time to fix up and he doesn’t expect me to wait nor could he ask that of me but he’d wish I did. He told me she said they are done as he previously “cheated” on her when he was away on a boys holiday and that’s why it’s genuinely over but the way he feels about me is genuine, at the same time he mentioned that they were on and off multiple times so it’s hard to believe him. He states they are over and he will move out really soon but the economic situation of the country makes me think otherwise. 

I lost my virginity to him and I can’t get him out of my head but after all the bad he’s done it’s so difficult to forgive and move past it. 

Currently he is blocked but I constantly think about unblocking him and trying to resolve things. I need advice as I can’t get him out of my mind no matter what I do. I’m in love with him, I genuinely consider him my first love and no matter how hard I try I can’t stop thinking he’ll fix up for me.",Fickle_Industry2965,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15axs6k/is_he_dating_his_baby_mother_or_me_after/,1690452278.0,0.67
"my M25 bf follows hundreds of explicit nsfw twitter accounts even after telling me he would unfollow all of them cause he wanted to do it for me. It makes me feel like he’d rather look at them than his own gf F18 

I (18F) met my current and first boyfriend (25M) on Twitter… I know that isn’t the best place to start a relationship but that’s just how things happened. We are in a long distance relationship and text/FaceTime almost everyday. We haven’t been dating for long and he already told me he loves me. He tells me everyday, and it doesn’t make me uncomfortable but I don’t say it back cause i don’t want to rush into it. He told me he’ll wait as long as I need, and it doesn’t bother him that I don’t say it back. 

 When we first started talking I would occasionally send him a “nsfw” pic and even now I sometimes send lil pics. He did the same for me, so it’s not like it’s one sided, but after looking at his following and likes on twitter i never want to send him anything again. After he asked me to be his gf, I stopped interacting with all of my male followers on Twitter (and I have a lot who are kinda obsessed with me, not to sound cocky lol) so it really made my stomach sink when I saw that even after asking me out, he was still liking explicit and nsfw picture of women on Twitter. 
 
I talked to him about it, without directly asking him to stop, he was the one who offered to unfollow all the nsfw accounts he followed because he wanted to do it for me. I told him that I didn’t want him to do it just because I wanted him to, I wanted him to do it because he wants to do it because why would he need to be looking at that when he has a gf. I understand if he wants to watch explicit videos, but I draw the line when it comes to small accounts run by woman who are posting themselves rather than big accounts run by anonymous people posting explicit videos if that makes sense. I am definitely holding back saying “I love you” because of the accounts he follows, and told myself I wouldn’t say it until he stopped following them like he said he would. 

Honestly everyday I question if I even want a boyfriend, but then I talk to him and I’m reminded that I really like him and want to be with him. There have been times where we’ll be texting and out of know where he’ll say something like “not much, wby wyd?” And it makes me think he is texting some other girl, because what he messaged has nothing to do with what we were talking about . I’ll admit I have serious trust issues cause of my dad who cheated multiple times when my mom and him were together. So I don’t know if that clouds my judgment when it comes to if he is cheating on me or not. I really hope he isn’t, and I won’t ever ask if he is cause I don’t want him to think I don’t trust him. 

Am I wasting my time or am I the one with a problem? He is perfect on paper, he compliments me alll the time, tells me how much he loves and values me, makes sure I know that he means everything he says, and tells me I’m the best gf ever (I wouldn’t say that lol). Am I wasting his time? I’m scared to even consider breaking up with him cause I don’t want to hurt him or make him feel insecure. His past relationships haven’t been great, they took advantage of his kindness and how giving he is and im scared he’ll think that im just like the rest of them. I really do care about him and I almost tell him I love you every time we talk. But I can’t help but hold back cause what if he does something to prove that he’s unloyal or faking his love just to get things from me.

There have been times where he mentions our age gap and it’s made me uncomfortable cause it makes me think he’s only dating me cause I’m 18, and I’m scared he won’t want to be with me when I am not 18…

I really don’t know what to do and I can’t talk to my friends or family about this cause they would judge me. Sorry it is so long but if you took the time to read this I really appreciate you and this is my first time using Reddit so sorry if it’s not perfect.

I'm really happy with my self. I'm in shape, have Alot of friends and Hobbys. I get a lot off compliments about my looks and personality. Also I have a decent career path usw.
Hope I didn't sound like I'm arrogante or overly prag the whole time about me 
Don't worry I know for girls personality and confidence matters the most. I don't wanna debate that :)
But still only attract  women I don't find attractive, usually looks wise or a lot older far away. Never seen to work with the one I like. I've been on so many dates. It's never mutual...
It feels like I always hurt girls or I get hurt :/

I'm pretty sure I have more confident around girls I'm not attracted to, cause I don't care about them in a romantic way. With women I like I always fucked it up,worry about anything I do. 
Probably I subconsciously behave weird around them, to not make it work cause of  fear of rejection.
Usually I get the advice to speak and date to more women I'm really into. 
But they always reject me, I feel like these countless rejections made me even more anxious around women I like. For example around them I often run out of  topics to speak about act unsure

"Why do guys keep bothering you if they’re not interested? Been talking to this guy for a while. We’re both in our early thirties. I was pretty direct about what I wanted and he gave me a little bit of an excuse (just got out of a several years long relationship, which he did and which I knew) but basically give him time and he’ll come around. 

After a few months, he asked me if he should start dating (the implication being, other women). I was like ok, yeah, sure, go for it, because I figured alright, he’s not interested, we’re done. 

Then like a week later, he tried to hang out— made specific plans. I agreed mostly because I was curious and wanted to see if there was even the possibility of a friendship there but I also knew this was his last chance. He flakes and spends the whole night texting me but doesn’t ask to come hang out. That was the final straw for me so I told him, hey, we’re done here, we’re not doing this.

He kept trying to meet up with me all summer, even when it was obvious he was seeing someone else. He was constantly flirting with me. Tbh I mostly ignored him unless I was bored/lonely enough to want to talk to anyone at all but I didn’t flirt with him. Every time he asked to hang out, I made a very obvious and nondescript excuse not to. 

Then the other day, dude basically tells me in no uncertain terms: I don’t want a relationship with you and I’m dating other people. I didn’t really react because I was over it by that point and had been for months and just went on with the conversation. By total coincidence I did end up breaking up with a guy I had begun seeing (compatibility issues) later that day and he put 2+2 together from socials. 

Ever since then he’s been alllll over the place. Liking my selfies and stories, then disappears. Takes snaps at the bar in my neighborhood, doesn’t ask to hang out, disappears, and then barrages me with messages once he’s gone (that I basically ignore). It’s one thing to still want to have sex but he’s not even like, trying to make that happen 

I was going to just be cool about it because even though he’s a total fukboy, he is actually nice and helpful when you remove the sexual tension. And tbh, even though he wasted my time a bit and jerked me around a little, ultimately, it’s not a big deal— he was flaky and weird, he didn’t like, cheat on me or kill my cat. But this weird behavior is so annoying. I don’t necessarily want to just peace out on him because we have a lot in common and he’s got a lot of mutuals with me and I could see getting past this weirdness but I don’t really need or want some dude flirting with me and trying to get my attention for literally no practical reason. So what the hell? I Don ’t even wanna ask him because like, why would I even expect a straight answer?",Jasmotron3k,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ar448/why_do_guys_keep_bothering_you_if_theyre_not/,1690430039.0,0.63
"What do people look for in a partner? Recently out of a 4 year relationship in which my ex described me as a “Golden Retriever” in that I am loyal and offer companionship, but I don’t do things like cook her breakfast in bed or take care of her outside of emotional support. She said a partnership is where both people pick each other up. I thought I did that, but she considered me too much of an individual. She made a solid point and the golden retriever analogy was apt, but it started making me question what I had to offer to the dating world. 

Is companionship, company, and loyalty not enough to sustain a long term relationship? What would you say is?",supernasty,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15asytr/what_do_people_look_for_in_a_partner/,1690435872.0,1.0
"Am I the only one who feels like today’s society diminishes the value of relationships?   Recently I went through a hard breakup in a long term relationship. We had dated for almost 3 years and she was my first love and my first girlfriend. As much as I still miss her, I can look back on that relationship and know it was a true, real, loving relationship. And when I think about what kind of person I want to be with and what kind of relationship I want to have moving forward I realize that it doesn’t line up with what society expects today. 

&amp;#x200B;

  For example, I don’t really want to be with a girl who has slept around with a bunch of people for fun. To clarify that’s something that I would never do either. I don’t really want a girlfriend who goes and gets blackout drunk at clubs and parties around the type of guys who only think about sex, which is simply increasing. Call me naïve but I feel like todays society decreases the value of relationships and lowers the amount of real relationships. Perhaps this is the reason why the marriage rate in the US has dropped nearly 60% in the last 50 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

  And while I know these standards are a good thing to have, I’m going to be going into college next year and with how prevalent all of this type of behavior is, I’m wondering how long it will be before I have the chance to find a real relationship again. What do you guys think?",Theredfox255,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ak9r4/am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_like_todays_society/,1690411359.0,0.82
"My ex (18m) and I (18f) broke up but I am having second thoughts and I know I shouldn’t. My ex and I broke up after 3 years of dating. When we dated it started off from sending inappropriate pictures. Our relationship was very centered around sexual contact. Of course he loved me and I loved him I have no doubt about that as him and I didn’t only have sex but also had hung out and played games together quite often. We texted everyday and called one another everyday. We went to school together and would make time to always see one another between classes as we had none together. All around we seemed pretty great together from the outside perspective. We were considered the power couple of the school. Unfortunately during this all, we had fought and broken up several times. Our parents broke us up multiple times too as they saw we had been sending inappropriate pictures to one another when we are 15-17. We stopped sending and only had in person sexual contact. 

Here’s where the problem is, him and I both have mental health issues that we both need to work on and I know that he won’t work on his unless we aren’t together cause he always just considered me his “therapist” or atleast I considered me his with how he said that he didn’t need one because he had me. But I always referred him to the idea of one saying that it’s great for anyone and everyone. He says he doesn’t need one. I know he’s insecure and an over thinker and I think the idea of needing a therapist and hearing it from his girlfriend made him insecure and upset. Anytime I mention the idea of one he would get mad at me. We also have had a lot of issues regarding me being sexually abused multiple times during our dating, not by him but by a family member and someone who I had considered a friend. This damaged our relationship a lot as he made me feel the assault by my friend was my fault. His dad sort of convinced him of this also saying that I “had to have been flirty with him” which is untrue. He doesn’t blame me for the family member one as It was when I was in the ages 8-10 years old during that period of time it was occurring. 

I have left him multiple times in the past but I had always came back to him. He has always made me smile and happy. There is more to the story of why we broke up recently but the just of it was that I moved to a different area and I started to realize that I had relied so heavily on him that I now know I didn’t need him as much as I made myself think I did. I can now make friends and find y own person as he was very protective and obsessive over me which I never minded until it came to where he accused me of cheating on him with anyone I talked to. 

Sorry if this is so jumbled I am very stress as I don’t know what to do. I know I should probably just take a break from dating all around and try and work on what and who I want as a person but I am scared to officaillay commit to that because I don’t want to lose him. He has his flaws but I really do love him and care for him.

"My ex date is threatening me 31F Hey everyone! Im in a really weird situation right now. I started seeing this woman who is 31F and im 25M it lasted for 2 weeks. We had sex couple of times always protected. She took morning after pill for the first night. Nothing suspicious happened but we wanted to be sure. A day later she texted me i found condom inside my vagina. First day we were drunk so i said maybe it did slip away but im pretty sure that i did not ejaculate on that day. And a day later she took another pill.

Then she started acting horribly to me in an abusive manner. Told me that i should be paying for her doctor appointment, bacterial tests, hcg test and everything. And sent me her iban and i should send her money. Of course I didn’t cause it was so suspicious for me. She did a pharmacy test 2 days later since our sexual intercourse and it was negative i did show it to 7 different woman they all said its negative. She claims that it is positive…


So i offered her to split the doctor bills and she claimed that i should be paying for all. If not she will go to the police. I don’t even know if i did something wrong or illegal. Well i took her an appointment for 10 days later since our intercourse. The day of the appointment arrived and she said i should be cancelling the appointment cause she had her period. 

3 days later she texted me her period lasted for 2 days and i should be getting an another appointment. And she claims that she started vomiting. (Its been 3 weeks since we had intercourse, every woman i asked said that she is bullshitting since it doesn’t start that early).  I asked her if she can do another pharmacy test so we can have an idea if she is pregnant or not and she rejected it and called me idiot and said that they are not reliable at all. And if im not paying her doctor bills that she would go to the police.

So i asked women around me and they all told me to block her cause she makes no sense. Im completely lost like why would she reject to do a pharmacy test before an hospital test if they are suspicious of pregnancy…

"Hypothetical - Was rape or assault committed at the end of this hypothetical date. Lets say a woman and a man had a lovely evening drinking and listening to music at his house. He ends up making a move and they start kissing, the kissing escalates all the way to sex. Now the girl never told him no or stop at any point either verbally or with a physical gesture and her body language actually seemed encouraging. She allowed every escalation and from his perspective she seemed like she was clearly consenting based on body language. 

However this girl actually didnt want to have sex, she was just a very agreeable person who had trouble communicating her boundaries and did not want to say no to the man for whatever reason so she allowed him to have his way. After the sex she really regrets the night and never speaks to the man again.

I have a friend I met online, we have met only once before this encounter....the first time we hooked up with just making out and mutual masturbation, I thought it was really fun! We communicated after and he said he had fun, although I came and he did not....I only used my hands on him that time, not my mouth. So now, he comes over, we are pressed for time as my babysitter is only watching l.o. til a certain time. He took his pants off and sat on the couch, in the car on the way over, and in texts, I said I wanted to give him oral...we kissed,  I went down on him, he got very hard, pretty fast, was moaning...enjoyed it, precumming, called me a good girl, cuz thats how we play...he had been previously been  playing with and licking my breasts, he suddenly told me-take off your pants! I kinda mildly protested that we didn't have time, it was his turn for an orgasm. He fingered me a bit and we had some pentration, he asked me to come for him, then he hopped off, saying 'I'm finished"" I was like, wait, what, did you cum and I didn't notice? He still had a semi, didnt feel like he was soft inside. He said ""no, I'm just finished"". I'm a pretty big girl, and this was missionary-  he honestly seemed a bit tired. But WHY didn't he try to cum?! Is that not weird, I don't usually have this experience with guys. I asked him if he was okay-he's like yeah, let's save it for next time. Should I just leave it at that? I don't understand. The only other factor is he often boasts about being high (weed) and tonight I thought he smelled like alcohol, I asked and he said no. But it's a possibility. On the way back to drop him off, he was worried that now I'm thinking he's ""not good enough in the sack"" (I didn't say that) . A confidence thing? What gives?

"Urgent Help! Please The title is true… I need urgent help. 

About me:
23M make 400+k. Ready to have a serious relationship. Muslim and religious. Want a girl whose covered since to me it signifies modesty and virginity. 




Introduction:
So I’m a  pretty good looking Muslim who used a Muslim dating app. 

Matches with this girl. I did great job flirting. She wanted me number. And even before I responded she tried calling on the app, which I didn’t answer because I was busy. 
She spammed me with messages. 
I gave it to her but told her a riddle for it. 

Immediately I get a text from
Montreal. I live in Toronto running a towing business and also have a location in Montreal… I messaged her thinking she was a customer. 

She already starts flirting with me saying how she needs help because she’s stuck in the washer. 

Eventually we speak. Went well. Spoke for 4 hours. We both went for a virtual walk where I walk at a park and she does too. Was my idea. I like a lot about her. Her mom left her. My dad left me. It’s really weird but during the time her mom left her and my dad left me happened the same year. I kinda find that fascinating 


 Anyways She tells me she has to satisfy herrself every nightht before she goes to bed. That was the sexiest fucking thing ever. I started touching myself. Asked her what she liked. She told me. She asked me. I told her. I asked if she was playing with her self. She said yes. 
 But because I’m a devoted Muslim (and she is too). Sex after marriage. I told her if we’re getting married I can continue. She said she needed time
Because she just got out of a relationship. (I know I made a mistake there coming off like I’m in love with her after meeting her (but I am)). Before we went to bed she said she was spank me if I’m talking to other girls 

The next day went well… she texted me. I texted back later on. She then called me while she’s at work. Told me she’s having a problem with her boss. She said her boss said she could take the day off. She went to ask him. And he said no I said if you want to quit you should. He was very rude. I told her to quit. She did… afterwards I told her how she can help me find leads and I’d give her $100 or so… again I think another mistake… I told her we can focus on her potentially working for me as opposed to being sad about quitting. She said she wanted to talk to her sister. I kept saying not to because she will make the situation bigger than it seems. 


Anyways…. Problems start. I told her how everything will be ok etc. she didn’t respond. I texted her the next day saying let me know because I feel liable. Which is true… maybe her sister told her it’s my fault and stuff. Still no respond. Following day I sent her screen shot of a Turkish girl I was FaceTiming with to get her attention and a voice note (forgot to say that all we’ve ever sent each other was voice notes I’m typing to fast because I’m mad)


She fucking calls me at 1:30am when she hears it… I didn’t answer. She send two voice notes, 1 minute each. Where she pretty much says we can get to know each other and how she got out of a talking stage…

Anyways… we spoke that day FaceTimed I showed my self where she didn’t. I didn’t ask her too especially if she didn’t want too. The same day she sends me voice messages about how her aunt is getting divorced and it’s making her so upset. 

We kept talking and shit via voice memos. I texted saying that I’m promise they're not gonna divorce. Yesterday I replied to my text “they’re not gonna divorce” with an I right or am I right?  No response. 

Today this morning I sent a voice memo being flirty. 


Honestly… I think I was to availble for her and responded to fast. But my fucking job relies on answering my phone and driving around. If I am not on my phone I lose money.

"Should I be worrying about this? My (23F) boyfriend (35M) went to sleep instead of finishing round 2 of sex last night. 
So basically as the title says....we have been together for 6 months, have a pretty good sex life, see each 3-4 times a week and have sex once or twice a night. 

Last night we were both pretty tired (I got up at 5 am, he got up at 7 am) before going to bed, but had sex at like 11 pm. Then showered, got ready for bed by like 12 am. We were talking, joking about me needing round 2 but him being too tired. Then, he said he was horny from the convo but too tired to have sex again and I couldn't do a blowjob bc I had a root canal in the morning. 

So he said ""just jerk me off, you need to learn how to do this"" and I said ""we should just wait until tomorrow, i want you to be horny for sex tomorrow."" And he was like ""no i want it now"", so I started...

But he wants it in a very specific way without lube so it was difficult to do without the lights on, just trying to do it by feeling how his hand moves and copying him. So eventually he just took over jerking off while feeling my body. But he went soft and was like ""let's just go to sleep, i'm too tired and you made it into a whole thing, i'm not feeling turned on anymore."" 

I thought he was trying to say i did something wrong, and when I asked - he said I didn't and that we are all good...but i don't know, I feel worried that I didn't perform well or that he is not satisfied. 

For some additional context, some other things that make me feel like this: 

\- he had to teach me how to do blowjobs in the beginning in the specific way that he likes, and it takes him like 15-20 mins to cum from it still 

\- it takes him like 5-10 mins to jerk off with porn, but takes him like 30-45 mins to cum from sex 

\- he calls me a pillow princess like half-jokingly (I definitely kind of am) but idk if he feels unsatisfied 

\- he is a lot more experienced than me, I've really only ever had long-term sex with 2 other people

Is this just normal in longer term relationships and I'm overthinking it or did I do something wrong? I'm freaking out.

"Is my current boyfriend not good for me? Now I know if I have to ask that question, he’s probably not. The reason why I’m asking here, is I’m not sure who I can go to in my life right now to discuss this with, so hello Reddit lol. Thanks for taking the time to read. 

I’m not going to get into it too much, but we’ve been friends since highschool and are coming up on our one year anniversary. We’ve been in the same friend group and he decided to pursue me last year, very thoughtfully. I had been out of the dating scene for quite a while (5 years to be exact, I’m 23, still pretty young but ya know) and I was definitely swooned. Considering we’ve been close friends for so long and I had a budding attraction as the idea began being introduced, I took a while with myself to make sure I wasn’t committing out of loneliness. 

However, when we started dating, I saw a huge shift in who he is, or maybe I just started picking up on stuff that I ignored for years, because I hadn’t thought of him romantically until last year. Whatever it was/ is, it’s made me question a bunch about myself and him. I like to think I people read as well as the next person, but this man is not easily read. I’m concerned firstly, he said one of the reasons he pursued me is because he admired how empathetic I can be, whereas, he struggles with empathy. He’s very logical, and has a strict set of principles he follows. Originally, I thought it was sweet bc he made it seem like he wanted to learn from me and I found it highly respectable that he knew that about himself, and thought I was the one able to help him improve, but anytime I try to breakdown empathy with him, he seems incapable of putting himself in someone else’s shoes, and his sympathy feels forced, if that makes sense.I find it difficult to teach someone how to be empathetic, especially when they push back, which he does. 2.) he’s outwardly said to me he gets enjoyment out of pushing people to the point of frustration, “because he’s right.” And he is definitely very smart, and a lot of times, is right. Like I said, very logical. But my gut screams at me bc that doesn’t sit right with me, but then again, I am the opposite. He runs toward conflict, I tend to avoid it like the plague. 2.) rarely does he apologize, but I also haven’t been great at expressing my feelings towards him these past couple months.3.) he’s going for nursing, ultimately, wants to be a mental health professional. I worked as a pca for the last couple years at a hospital, i of course love that he is! But… I’m concerned because I myself have a variety of mental health disorders (ptsd being the root), and I fully accept that I have not been doing what I need to do to care for myself, nor do I expect him to be my personal therapist. I have a therapist for that, just haven’t worked up the courage to address this with her, mostly bc I’m worried she’ll confirm my suspicions, and encourage me to get out. (Another ah ha moment)

I have noticed as I had been struggling mentally, he is unable to think about how the emotions are affecting me, and he is the very first person to ever tell me I’m difficult to talk with. I’ve prided myself on having enough emotional self control to separate my emotions and weigh them with logic (rationalizing, which he does a great job) but he brings out a side of me that I don’t recognize, and it’s angry. However, I felt at times he pushed me to the point of breaking, or maybe it’s a combo of the things I haven’t resolved yet. 

Anywho, I know that’s a lot and I said I’d keep it short. So much to unpack, it’s the shortest I can make it. So thank you for taking the time to read this 🫶lmk what you think. **I want to avoid labels because it is not my place to say a person is this or that, I’ll leave that up to the professionals.** so, if you are able, I’d appreciate if you left those out :)",Ok_Procedure_3988,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15asirz/is_my_current_boyfriend_not_good_for_me/,1690434410.0,0.99

"Had some ED issues while on a date. Wish I knew the cause. I had a date with an indian woman I met at a club. She's 32, works in IT, and still a virgin and wanted lose the V that night. I got to her place, we had some pizza then got into the foreplay.

I should mention that on the bus ride to her place, I started to get some ""hot"" feelings in my bowel but they quickly subsided, therefore I ignored it. 

I wanted to have foreplay like I used to with my ex: Where we'd shower first, then use hands on each other, oral then sex. This girl wanted to do it differently. As me and her stripped down to our underwear, I fingered her and she jerked me. We had discussed what she'd like to do before and she said she was happy to do oral with me going down and she returns the favor, however that night she didn't want me going down on her and wanted me to go straight to the sex. 

The ""hot"" feeling was on and off now in the bowel and I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious but I also wanted to focus on this. 
I tried to enter her but for some reason I lost my erection right as I put on the condom. I still tried anyway but she was too tight and I went too soft so we couldn't continue.

I didn't want to use the bathroom but the ""hot"" feeling got worse and I had to go. She was cool with letting me stay and watching a few movies but I ended up having to get up a few times throughout the night to go back and forth to the bathroom. It was some bad diarrhea. 

I felt ashamed of not being able to get it up since I do watch a fair bit of porn while using sex chat rooms. I have been doing this for sessions of 4-8 hours and twice a week. I am trying to manage this use.

"How to choose whether to be exclusive with someone ? During high school and college, I (M23) was interested in dating a few people at various points, but they were never interested in dating me. Now that I'm out of college, I started using Hinge, and the situation is completely reversed. I'm not really sure why (I've never felt attractive before and I didn't glow up or start making massive amounts of money after college), but I get a lot of matches --- enough that I can go on dates most days of the week if I want to. I'm happy about getting to actually date for the first time in my life, and it is a lot of fun, but I'm completely new to the experience of having to consider multiple potential dating partners at once (in the past I usually became close friends with someone specific before I started to be interested in dating them, so my potential dating partners never numbered more than 1).The problem is that after 5-6 dates, the question of exclusivity comes up, and I feel a lot of pressure to go exclusive with whoever I started going on dates with first. By then I can tell that I'm attracted to them and find them interesting, but usually I don't know them nearly as well as I've known the people who I liked in the past and therefore don't feel the same way about them. So the natural questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) If I like someone after 5-6 dates but they don't make me feel the same way as someone from my past who didn't want to date me, should I agree to date them exclusively when they ask ?  It makes sense that those feelings might develop from putting more focus on getting to know them as a result of being exclusive, but it also feels like a lot of risk to commit to dating someone when I don't feel that way about them yet. It also feels like I'm leading someone on if I agree to that when I know I don't yet feel about them the same way I felt about someone else in the past (although it took a lot longer than 5-6 meetings to feel that way about that someone else).

&amp;#x200B;

(2) If I agree to date someone exclusively, and then a few months later (even if the dating experience is nothing but positive and I am still attracted to them and find them interesting) I conclude that I really don't feel the same way about them as I did about someone else from my past who didn't want to date me, should I break up with them ?  It feels wrong and entitled to do that to someone who cares about me and contributes something positive to my life, especially based on a comparison with someone who didn't care about me in the same way. I obviously know how much it hurts to be rejected by someone you are close to, and I hate the idea of making someone feel that way. If that is an okay thing to do (as opposed to staying in the relationship that is working fine for everyone), does anyone have any advice on how to break up with someone after a few months of dating exclusively in a way that is as respectful and polite and non-hurtful as possible ?  I know that it will have to hurt them no matter what, but I've been rejected inreally cruel ways that made me feel awful about myself and I don't want to do that to someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) \[a variant of (1)\] The following situation has happened to me twice so far: I download Hinge, and start going on dates with people. I end up having gone on 5-6 dates with the first person I matched with (""person A""), and there's a few others who I've gone on \~3 dates with who I also like (""persons B-D""). But by this point person A is asking for an exclusive dating relationship. It's a really hard choice to make because I haven't gotten to know people B-D as well yet (and as remarked in (1), in absolute terms I don't know any of them that well yet), and I don't have much prior dating experience. Of course I could ask person A for more time being non-exclusive in order to be more sure about each other --- obviously this depends on the woman, but (among women who want a serious long-term relationship) are people typically okay with this or do they typically take this as a sign of general unwillingness to commit and decide to stop dating ? If the consensus is that asking for more time from person A might as well be ""breaking up"", do people have advice about what to consider when choosing between continuing to date person A or not ?",troybarnes691,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15as2fm/how_to_choose_whether_to_be_exclusive_with_someone/,1690432957.0,1.0
"Confused and torn. How do I move on I went through a sudden and unexpected breakup about a year ago that I can only compare emotionally to the pain I’ve had when family members die. Like when my dad and brother died, they can’t be replaced.

I don’t know how to move on. I’m still in love with him to the same degree that I was when our relationship ended. He was the love of my life, we were planning marriage and a family together. and those feelings are meant to endure. 

But I don’t want to be alone for the rest of my life. If we can’t be together, I want to fall in love again. But it’s not fair to anyone I date if I’m not over my ex. And I’m not sure I ever will be, despite my best efforts.

Another guy and I found out we were looking for different things. He actually mentioned it first in which I just agreed. He got all creepy and was basically begging to continue after… (it was very confusing).

"I feel as if I had lost the love of my life There’s this guy, that i’ll call Gerard, i met him (almost) 5 years ago.  When i first met him, he was the kindest guy i had ever met in my whole life. As time passed, Me and Gerard fell in love, we dated for around 6 months (all this, being a long distance relationship), everything seemed ok to me, but then suddenly he told me he found another girl, naturally, i was confused, but i already expected that since he had been acting weird the days before that. I don’t remember much, but i do remember that we had been losing all the communication we had. When he told me he got someone new, we had an argument and decides to stop talking to each other (Here it was already 2019). This did not last long, we only distanced for one month, we both apologized and were in good terms once again. Ever since that, we kept on talking, but i couldn’t see him like that again. By December of 2019, i started slowly having a crush on someone, i’ll call her Ale, i ofc told him since after all i trust him way more than i even trust myself, he was ok with it. Here comes an important part, one that i regret so much. Gerard confessed to me on 2020, precisely on Valentine’s Day. I was flattered, but again, i already liked someone else by that time. I had to (sadly) reject him. I regret rejecting him so much. One month after that, i started dating Ale. He was always there to support me even though i wasn’t in a relationship with him. Soon then, arguments started with Ale, long story short, i was being constantly mentally abused by Ale. Gerard always told me that Ale was being a total jerk and that i should leave her. I didn’t. I regret not doing so, but i was blinded by my feelings. As time passed, i ended up breaking up with Ale in 2021 since she cheated. Gerard always supported me emotionally, he was always there for me. We did date by this time, but i told him that i wasn’t ready to have a relationship. Soon then, 2022 came in. We still talked a lot by January, even February, maybe. But that communication started going down, slowly. He told me he no longer wanted to talk to me by the time by August of the same year. I was hurt, sure, but i told him that i was ok with that. Time passed, and we started talking again this year, on May. We both talked it out, and started talking daily. We called almost every day at nights. It was the first time in a while i’ve ever felt so damned love by someone. If i had to be honest, he is the best guy i’ve ever met. He treats me so sweetly that it even overwhelms me. Everything was fine, until a week ago. He told me he needed time. I obviously understood it and told him i was okay with that if it was the best for him. But, i do miss him a lot. I’ve cried. I’m crying now. And there’s so much more than that, i always find myself missing him no matter the relationship i’m in. I just feel as if he was the correct one, idk how to explain it. But i’ve never felt that for someone ever before. It hurts but i also like it. But at the same time i still don’t know. Back then, we were both young.

"Advice on falling for my bff. There’s a catch I F and my best friend M met 2 years ago and started talking as friends. As the days have gone by we have gotten each other through tough times and we have grown a strong connection to each other seeming as though we are on the same wavelength. We have a lot of the same thoughts, interests and, opinions and we often say what the other is thinking. He has given me sound advice and tells me what I need to hear and not what I want to hear and has always been forward and honest with me as I have been with him. I have never had a friendship or relationship this strong with anybody and I have never felt such a deep rooted connection with someone as I have with him. I truly love this man as my best friend and hope we can stay best friends no matter what. But as the connection between us has grown so has our attraction for each other. The problem is though that he is married and has expressed to me his deep intentions of staying loyal even before we noticed any attraction towards each other. He told me when we first met he would never cheat and doesn’t understand people who cheat and has told me he plans to stay with his wife and does love his wife.

Would you date someone who doesn't like his/her own family ? Why and why not ? He or she just doesn't feel a connection with hisher family. No love connection or anything both parties did nothing wrong traumatically. No abuse just generally no connection. He she just is there with family. Rarely talks because no feeling of connection. Most are just small talks which he or she just finds it repetitive so no sense of talking. Basically no love or hate with his own family.

"Why can’t I make it past the second date? 27f. I’ve been in the dating apps for a minute. I consistently get first dates and often a second. Often times, I don’t feel a connection and communicate that clearly. In the last few months there have been 2 people who I really felt I vibed with but they don’t reach out after the second date to schedule a third. 

With the most recent, I went out of town after our second date and reached out  to start a conversation. We talked for a bit but then he left me on read. We didn’t really text prior to the dates but he still hasn’t reached out and I don’t think I should to see if he wants to meet up again. 

I’m fairly attractive and fit and I have a successful job. I’m not super touchy on first or second dates as I like to be friends with someone first.

"I (16M) Can't Get Over My Feelings for My Girl Best Friend (16F) I recently just had the most incredible day at the theme park with my girl best friend, and I need to share this heartwarming experience with all of you and ask for your opinions. We've known each other since we were around 5, and she means the world to me.

So, we decided to tackle this insanely long line for a ride, and let me tell you, it felt like an eternity—3 hours of queueing! 😅 But in all honesty, I wouldn't trade that time for anything. We held hands throughout the wait, not just to stay together but also because it felt comforting, special and helped pass the time.

The real magic happened when people started jumping over a fence to escape the queue. My girl best friend found herself in the way of the fence, so she leaned back, and instinctively, I hugged her from behind. I kid you not, when she looked back and smiled, it felt like a million butterflies fluttered in my stomach. It was such a genuine and intimate moment that it left me feeling overwhelmed with emotions.

Now, I can't stop thinking about that moment and what it might mean. I've had feelings for her for some time now, but this experience at the theme park has only intensified them.

So, here I am, trying to figure out what to do next. Should I tell her how I feel or keep these emotions to myself to protect our friendship? I'm genuinely torn, and any advice or similar experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this. :)",ItsmeSJ267,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15am047/i_16m_cant_get_over_my_feelings_for_my_girl_best/,1690415688.0,1.0
"Acceptable to ask out a job applicant that was rejected? I understand that asking a coworker out is frowned on these days. Yet my parents met each other at work. I wouldn't be here if they didn't have a relationship.

I recently interviewed a candidate. She was rejected by other managers. I did not reject her application and she was my first pick. She was my first pick based on her professionalism and skills. So her application rejection had no agenda on my part. She has no future prospects at the company.

I really enjoyed talking to her. I felt that we were very in sync during the interview. She was obviously polite since it's an interview but it just felt like time flew by. After I phoned her about the rejection she also asked me if she could connect on linked in (not sure if this is common practice).

There's no power that I hold over her at this point. I've clearly told her that she won't be hired. And if she was employed I would not ask her out under any conditions, because we would not only be co-workers but I would also have been her boss.

I assume the resounding answer here will be that asking her out is predatory and stupid. Yet a female coworker made a joke to me that I could ask her out now that she's been rejected. This was after expressing that I was disappointed in her being rejected.

Thoughts?

\- Would it be creepy if I reached out a few weeks after the rejection to ask her out on a date?

\- Is asking for a linkedin connection from the person hiring you after being rejected normal? Is this an indication of interest?",giveuporfindaway,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15aqm4v/acceptable_to_ask_out_a_job_applicant_that_was/,1690428522.0,0.67

"Not looking for a relationship I’ve been dating this girl for about 6 weeks seeing her probably 3 times a week. We’re only 18 so met in a pub smoking area where she approached me. She’s been massively into me by what she has sent and said to me. I get along with her friends and all. We went on a date last week where her friend was there. She wanted to see me afterwards without the friend being there but i had plans booked weeks in advance so had to let her down (kind of shit ik but not my fault i have friends) replies slowed down after so spoke to her about it this week and what was going on. She’s said that’s she’s not ready for a relationship at the moment and needs to sort herself out. Usually I’d think this would be a kind way of rejecting me but she has a troubled family life and a mum that’s quite sick as far as i know which leads me to doubt the rejection idea. It also seems very different to how she was treating me only 5 days ago.

I accepted what she said and said that hope whatever is going on sorts itself out and have left it there. My current plan is too leave it 3/4 weeks and then arrange to meet up with her and mutual friends and see where it goes from there.

"My 19F boyfriend 18M broke up with me after almost 2 years A little background: my now ex (I’ll call him Dan) and I were very close a few years before getting together but stopped talking due to me getting into a toxic relationship and not being “allowed” to talk to guys. Almost as soon as I got out of the relationship, we rekindled out spark and fell hard and fast for each other. Over the past let’s say 2 years, Dan and I have had an amazing relationship. He helped me heal with what I had went through in that toxic relationship and we spent almost all of our time together. We moved up to college together. The only thing was we would fight. Now I understand every relationship has its arguments but sometimes we argued a lot and I take the blame for most of those fights. I would get upset over little things and it would spiral into an argument. But after every fight we came back and we were constantly going out to dates or just spending time together. Fast forward to a couple days ago. Him and I were the happiest we had been in a long time but we got into a pretty big fight. We both did things very wrong in that fight. The fight boiled down to how I felt like the effort and respect he used to give me was a lot less than what he was giving me now. I felt very upset because we had talked about what we both needed from each other and I gave him everything he head asked for but I felt as if I was hardly getting anything I said I needed. We went back and forth for a couple days saying if we were together or not and it crushed me to imagine myself without the person I felt was my person. The other night he had decided that we would be together and work on it together but I was terrified that he would would back out or leave again and lo and behold he did the next day. We had a very good talk and both agreed that we could go back to just being friends but honestly I don’t know if that’ll hurt me more and I don’t know how to just be friends with him. I love him with all my heart but I’m also scared of being hurt again. We also agreed that maybe once he got the mental help he needs that maybe we can try us again. Any advice. I was so in love with him and even though I know we are young I feel like what we had was special. He would talk about me to everyone he talked to and he would spoil me like crazy.

"I’m (19) having some issues with this guy I’m seeing (24) about paying 50/50 on dates Him and I have been talking since the beginning of June. He moved here to Miami a few months ago from Spain for work. When we met in person I wasn’t physically attracted to him but as we’ve opened up and gotten to know one another I’ve grown to like him. 

He does not have a car. Ever since our first date I have been the one that picks him up and drives us to wherever we go. Now, I don’t have an issue with that but what is bothering me is how I am the one that drives 30-40 minutes to pick him up from his job and then another 20 minutes to go back to his apartment to then have to pay for parking (which is awfully expensive in Miami). I’ve also been the one that has been paying for parking wherever we go out. 

And the times he’s ubered food for us while at his place, he’s made a point to buy the cheapest food he can find and has said “I’m only paying for you because I really like you, I don’t do it for everybody”. Which absolutely rubbed me the wrong way. The times we’ve gone out, he’s passed up any and every restaurant after I’ve suggested we go out to eat because he doesn’t feel like paying for food so we just don’t get anything. 

I feel like I’m not being met in the middle with paying for things and it’s frustrating. I realized thats something very important to me and I needed to talk to him about it. 

Last week we went out and when we went back to his place (after I payed for mall parking, parking at his place and made the drive to pick him up from his job) I expressed that I wanted him to put more of an effort in paying for parking and have things 50/50. He said that he had cash but couldn’t zelle me anything because his bank account which is from Spain, doesn’t have zelle. He still has not made an effort to pay me half the parking for just that one time. He also doesn’t really put effort in planning our dates. He’s always asking me what we’ll be doing and never takes the initiative in making plans, which is something I want him to do. 

He’s a great guy, and we both prioritize communicating and being open with one another about where we see ourselves taking this relationship .

"How do you know? (19F) currently going through a break out with friends. At first I held on as best as I could untill I let go and right now I’m happy finding myself again. But dating boys my age is horrible. Not saying I don’t get attention, but they’re just not emotionally mature and don’t understand “the real world”. All they care about is ego, trucks/cars, how to get bigger biceps, and how to get one night stands because they’re not wanting to put in the effort to commit. 

But I don’t figure all of this out untill after 3 months. Is there any way to know if they’re just in it because they think you’re naive or you just have a pretty face and body to fuck? How do you know if they’re really in it to build together? Or how do you know their motive is just to dump you after the 3 months and move on to the next? How do you know when they first ask to hang out they’re not going to press sex onto you? (I struggle with guys who do this a lot) how do you know their eyes are open to really get to know YOU and not your body??

Friends: going back to when I said a break out with friends. I’ve also been coming to the conclusion that distancing myself from all guy friends is because I don’t want to lead them on.

"Situationship advice Okay I will try to be as short as possible. I’m a female and I will refer to my guy as T.
Me and T met on a dating app in march. He is a very strange (in a good way) person, veryyy mysterious, an outsider. We started texting on insta like once or twice a week, nothing special. I’ve always liked him a little since he is very interesting to me and I can’t seem to understand him which makes me want to know him more…
In the beginning of july he texts me his address and asks me to hang out (out of nowhere). I agree, we meet, first 10 minutes were very awkward, he was very nervous. We talk more, some random things and I noticed that he avoids talking about his personal life, so I don’t ask him too much. We laid on the grass, we talk, he asks to kiss me (very respectfully), I agree, we kiss. It was not an “I wanna f*ck you kiss”. It was actually very romantic and something I’ve never felt. He held my hand all the time, kissed my forehead, played with my hair. During the date I ask him what he is looking for and he told me that he is ready for a relationship but wants to go with the flow and doesn’t wanna rush anything. He told me he is not looking for one night stands, but he used to when he was younger. He took a break from dating because he used to get very possessive.
He walks me home, everything is great until he doesn’t text me all week after the date. I texted him to ask him how is he, he sends me a video of him cooking and basically we talk like nothing happened one week ago. After that he randomly texted me about an insta story I posted days ago (he doesn’t follow me on insta, just stalks me)
Then this sunday he asked me out on a second date like 20 days after the first one. He texted me “I bought a hammock and I can’t wait to kiss you there” 
We go out, we kissed,laid chest to chest with each other. It was the most romantic thing I experienced. Nothing sexual happened (I told him long time ago I need time). He constantly asked me if I’m comfortable.It was just pure affection. We talked about random shit, I told him about my issues with my father and he was very understanding. He walks me home, holding my hand. Then he texts me “Tell me how you are feeling after the date” 
The next day he texts me again out of nowhere and he recommended me a book and told me “you are not responsible for your dad behaviour”
That was in monday and we haven’t texted in 3 days. I’m starting to realise that Im falling in love with him and the thought of him possibly talking to other girls is killing me. Of course I can’t blame him since we are not dating. But I can’t do that “no label “thing.
What should I do? How do I ask him? Do you think he wants a relationship with me?

"Being repeatedly ghosted is having a severe impact on my mental health I'm 26f

Been ghosted multiple times (after 1 or 2 dates) despite the guys being very keen on the date and making physicl advances.

One guy particularly stung  me. He followed me on Instagram and we got chatting - turned out we knew same people and had a lot in common. We talked constantly for a week before arranging to meet. I said he could come to mine as I live right near his work. He made physical advances pretty much as soon as he saw me, kept saying how horny he was for me.  I refused to sleep with him thinking that would keep him interested. He kept saying what a great time he had had and couldnt wait to see me again. We contnued talking a few days thens suddenly ghosted and unfollowed etc. 

I'm not seeking to apportion blame-i know these guys dont owe me anything. But I'm just looking for some advice as to how I can continue dating whilst protecting myself emotionally- dont think I can withstand further rejection.  I've just started a new job so stressed about that too.

I have been going to more social events like meetups and professional Networking. Women are out there I went yesterday to a young professionals meeting and saw maybe 4 or 5 women who were new and were in corner no one approached them. Anyways I made a pact with myself to meet new women and ask them out in person. Last few times I gone out I have been talking to women more.

My problem is sometimes you meet someone and talk for say 30-45 minutes then disperse but what is a great way to get her number without it being awkward or interrupting her.

It took a few days of swiping to really train the algorithm to me but...definitely worth it.

Others like OkCupid I find the % to be totally useless at times. The questions are too broad. Just also say less active.

"I'm tired of being sexually unattractive Dating for the past few years have been pretty difficult for me. I'm always told that I'm nice to talk to or I'm sweet, but there's never any sexual attraction to me. The last woman I was dealing with was really enthusiastic about me at first, but then later down the line she eventually just admitted she's not sexually attracted to me. Its like I always have to ignore the fact that I have a sex drive because I know that I'm just not the kind of guy that woman would be intimate with for some reason. I'm not fat, I'm in good shape, I take my hygiene seriously, but for some reason I just don't have any sex appeal. 

After this last situation I'm not even sure if I want to continue dating anymore. I know there's more to relationships than sex, but it really does make me feel like crap to be told ""Hey you're cool, I just wouldn't ever think of touching you though."" basically. When I was younger, like in my early 20s ( I'm 32 now) I didn't really have this issue to this extent. I dealt with a few people who wanted to be intimate with me.

"I pushed someone away About 9 months ago I was fresh out of a seriously draining relationship. There was a lot of drama and it was definitely toxic. I've gone through a lot of therapy to get over it. I met this guy at a concert and didn't expect to get into something so soon but it just happened. He treated me really well even though he was kind of overbearing and got ahead of himself. He was immature and moved insanely quick. I got scared and pushed him away because I wasn't ready to move so quick even though I really liked him. He was crushed.

My ex saw him at a party a few months after that and then my ex messaged me saying he told him the reason I pushed him away was because I was still messing with him. I told him that was really messed up he lied to him and to leave him and me alone but I never messaged the guy I had pushed away about it to tell him that's not true.

Fast forward to now. I am feeling healed and ready for a healthy relationship. My first thought went to this guy. I went to follow him on Instagram since I didn't have an Instagram before and he immediately blocked me. I made a burner account and saw that he just recently got in a relationship. I'm crushed. There's so much I wanted to say and clarify and I hate the way it all ended. I truly think it was the right person wrong time, and now I'm too late.

How can I feel better about this? It's no one's fault really.

"How to navigate dating as a demisexual person? Hello, I (28F) am demisexual. I do feel sexual attraction to men, but only after a connection has been formed and I really like them. My first serious relationship was when I was about 21, and while he ended up being very toxic and I had to leave for my own wellbeing, it broke my heart because I was head over heels for him and enjoyed being with him in that way. My last relationship was about 3 years ago and it was awful, I did not like him much at all and had to fake everything (I was very mentally ill and he was not a good boyfriend.) Since then, I've done a lot of work on myself and while I do not plan to go out and start trying to find a partner tomorrow, it is my goal to start trying again in a few months time.  


My question is, how do I explain this to people in a dating situation? I did not realize I was demisexual the last time I was on dating apps, but now I do. ""Hello, I do not want sex and will probably not want it for an undetermined amount of time unless I really end up liking you""...I just feel like there will be lots of guys who do not understand, do not believe me, or ignore that.

"First time dater here, need advice. Two great dates, but I feel like im more interested. So I (m24) met this bi guy (21). I only went on 2 online dates and one semi date before, never been in a relationship. He had relations but only to women, he just made out with a guy once.


I saw him twice in a bar without talking to him. The third time I met him through friends in a park. I sparked up the conversation by asking him if we saw eachother before in that bar. He kinda hit on me and we talked for an hour, then I had to leave for work. But we did exchange numbers and set a date on the weekend. 

Date happened, it was great, spent like 13 hours in total, met some of his friends in-between. We basically befriended eachother on this date. I felt it was very romantical but I still asked him on the next day in a carefully worded message if that was a date or not, also stating I don't wanna pressure him into anything. He said yes it was, but he did not think too much about it. Which was a great answer for me, as it told me yes there is an interest but also without any pressure.

So the second date happened, also just overall great. It ended with us making out at my place and falling asleep. We were both not interested in having sex. This was the last time we met, cause he is out of town right now for a few weeks. I had plans which got cancelled so now I texted him saying I would like to visit him to which he agreed, without a set date yet.

So yea what's the catch?
1. I feel like he seems less interested than me than I am in him, even tho he did ask for the 2nd date (he did leave me the option for it not to be a date though for some reason) 
2. I just have the feeling that I am crushing very hard and I don't wanna push him away, while also doing what feels right for me.

In the last year I’ve been on dates with 11 different guys, two of which became quasi-relationships but ultimately didn’t last. I have always been a romantic person and thought my person was out there somewhere (even though I am totally financially independent, have a good job, have lots of friends and hobbies etc), but after being engaged to a guy who put in 0 effort, trying the online dating thing for a solid year, and dealing with all the bullshit that comes with it (ghosting, being strung along, being dumped and then hit up 6 months later, etc etc), I can finally say for the first time in my life I do not want a relationship. I do not want to date. I truly don’t want to be anywhere around men (unless they’re a friend or related to me). The thought of it is honestly repulsive. It feels very freeing!

"My Third Date - My Dating Experience on a Herpes Dating Site Let’s get to my third date. It was with this woman who I’d already known for quite a while. Though this woman was technically the third person I date from this platform, we had been communicating for quite some time before our in-person encounter. From our very first chat, there was a connection. Her life was firmly rooted in Florida, where she worked, and our virtual proximity allowed for a mutual exchange and understanding.  
  
We decided to spend an afternoon together. It started with us meeting at a local coffee shop where we filled hours with light-hearted conversations. I remember there was a certain ease to our meetup, a comfort level that only comes with familiarity.  
  
Post the coffee session, we headed for dinner. Shared meals always tend to bring people closer, and quite fittingly, we bonded over our mutual love for food.  
  
As the evening melted into the coolness of the night, we decided to go back to her place. It led us to an interesting turn of the night. She suggested sharing a bath together—an unusual but intriguing idea.  
  
And then came the moment that you might guess—a moment of closer physical intimacy, right in the bathtub, far away from the convention. But we went there, a decision meant for us and us alone. It didn’t stop there either, as we continued the scenario on her bed, weaving an experience of intimacy and connection that was unique yet familiar, a dialogue of affection expressed without words.  
  
Remember, this is less of a raunchy tale and more about the journey through a dating experience on a site that caters specifically to people with herpes. That shared understanding forms the backdrop of our interactions.  
  
So, there it was, my third date - a tapestry of fond memories, of connection built over coffee, food, amusing conversations, and mutual affection—all painted on a canvas of understanding and acceptance. This simple tale has less to do with the number in the series of dates and more with the exploration of companionship, acceptance, and shared experiences.",N111ko_for_dating,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15an0bt/my_third_date_my_dating_experience_on_a_herpes/,1690418361.0,0.25

""I want you to be my future ex-wife"" usually means recongnizing that the relationship is ultimately doomed to fail (if both stay at their current maturity levels,) but she brings something so wonderful to your life its worth half your current and future wealth.  


My gf at the time started consistently calling me this around the six month mark and we ended things about 18 months later. I had not given it a lot of thought, but in restrospect I feel like I need some female insight into the matter.

Did she just want my money, did she want kids, did she know it was over, or I just sucked, or maybe it was just recreating the relationship her parents had?

"How do you show that you are interested without coming across as “too much”? I feel like dating is a game. And I always end up losing because I clearly don’t know how to play very well. I feel like I’ve always fallen too fast and too hard and it has led me to get hurt in the past. Texting them all the time to get no response. Waiting on them because I’m hung up on their every word. I’d want to be around them all the time. Their feelings were never on the same level as mine. Now it’s the complete opposite.

"Need some advice So basically, I started messaging this girl about 3 weeks ago, we really hit it off, she was on holiday and I was at festival when we first started speaking, we were just sending video message after video message, we’d planned to go on a date when she got back but we changed plans because she was heavily jet-lagged, but she really wanted to see me so I stayed over at her, we spoke for hours about anything and everything, it was great and then we ended up sleeping together, there was real chemistry there, over these 3 weeks, I’d stayed over a bunch of times, cooking food and enjoying each other’s company, the texting was non-stop and we spent a lot of time together without going on an actual date, we had planned to go on dates however. We both said things that maybe to some people seemed very early but we both agreed it felt right, however, I noticed she wasn’t the same on Monday, I asked her what was up and she said that I have a lot of love to give but she doesn’t know whether she’s the right person for it, she also said the whole situation has scared her so we agreed to call it off.

"Went on a date, we kept texting but now he's barely replying, is that a bad sign? Hi! I'm gay and I met this cute and really nice on a dating app (it was Grindr and we both hate that app, he uninstalled it 1h after). We both look for something serious and have a lot of interests in common, so our conversations are really good and never boring. Before our date he event went to say stuff like ""Well today I'm really ugly but if you like me that way then I'm good with you forever ahah"" kinda as a joke.

We went on a date, we both expressed that we liked it and after that we still talked (one day, one of our convos lasted for 2 consecutive hours). But then he went on vacations with his family and he has been very absent, I sent him some audios and texts and he didn't reply to any of them... he then sent a random meme, ignoring everything I said earlier and he hasn't replied ever since (it's been 3 days). 

I haven't had a boyfriend for 6 years and I have a huge history of getting ghosted or people losing interest on me, and replying less frequently is one of the first things that usually happens. I'm afraid that it may be the case, but I wanna make sure if I'm not overreacting or acting clingy.

Smth else I've noticed is that alot of people will blame other things besides themselves if they can't get a date. If it didn't work out then try again another tike if you'd like.

At first it was fun, but it got super overwhelming because I was going on so many dates in so little time. I also felt like I had a problem because I wouldn’t ever go on a second date with any girl I went with. I had 0 idea how to do anything.

"How do I navigate meeting the son of a family friend? Long story short, I (30F) went through a breakup of a 6-year relationship early this year. I've taken time to sit with everything that has happened and to adjust to my new situation. I'm able to feel hopeful again now and am starting to think to the future.

"What could I have done differently sex wise so she would have wanted a relationship with me? Prefaces: we will never get back together as she’s got a boyfriend and I’m doing my best to move on. Also sorry for the long read as I overthink badly sometimes.

So I dated a girl for about 2 months, on the 2nd date she told me she wasn’t over her ex. I should have stopped dating her after that but I carried on.

When we had sex, I couldn’t perform as normal (I.e. when I feel completely at ease). I was taking finasteride and also told her I needed time to build a connection with her before I could perform fully. I’m not taking finasteride any more and haven’t for years. I’ve always struggled having casual sex as I feel uncomfortable not knowing the girl I’m having sex with on a deep level. She always looked distant during sex, like her mind was on someone else. But I felt like if I told her about this she would push me away. I appreciated that she might need time to deal with things in her head first.

She broke up and told me she needed time to work things out alone. But then 6 months later she had a boyfriend and took him to Italy with her family. I suspected the reasoning for the breakup was something sex related and she didn’t tell me for fear I would react badly. She told me months after we broke up that ‘I helped her through a hard time and a I’m a really nice guy’ which I assumed was code for she didn’t find me sexually attractive. But she never communicated her sexual thoughts and needs, other than asking for sex. I felt like she felt like sex was something she did to keep me around rather than wanting to do it out of physical attraction. Plus she always shut me down or turned it into a joke whenever I tried to have any kind of deep conversation with her.

"I (21F) breakup with my boyfriend (21M) of three years and started dating another guy (21M) just after three days of breakup I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy for more than 3 years, and some time back, we decided to end the relationship. The main reasons for us to end our relationship were our constant fights, lack of understanding between us, insecurities, and all that kind of stuff.  
  
But 3 days after our breakup, I started dating one of my close friends who knows everything about me and my relationship status.  
  
Now the issue is that even when I was dating my ex, I was confused about my feelings for my current boyfriend. Initially, when I realized this, I used to tell myself some excuse or another and try to forget about it. I didn't break up with my ex then because I loved him a lot and was not sure about my feelings for that friend.  
  
Since then, it has been very hard for me to trust myself. I always fear that if my feelings for my current boyfriend change or I start feeling for someone else, then I'll end up hurting him as well.  
  
My current boyfriend knows all about my situation and my fears. He always tells me that I should not blame myself for it and start trusting myself again. But no matter how hard I try, I always end up thinking about it the same way because the fact that I got attracted to someone else even when I was in a relationship (I loved my ex a lot, and even after I got confused about my feelings for that friend, I was still sure that what I felt for my ex was very strong) is something I could never justify.

"My dating history I was sitting at my computer, scrolling through the pages of a dating website, trying to find my better half. Honestly, I was starting to lose hope that I could find something real here. But suddenly, my eyes landed on a photo, captivating and mysterious with its gaze.  
I decided not to hesitate and sent her a message, making sure to attach my own photo. After a while, I received a reply: ""Hello! What are your interests in life?"" There was something in her tone that made my heart beat faster.  
Our conversation became unusually easy and enjoyable. She turned out to be an intelligent and educated woman, with a sense of humor and a hidden tenderness. We spent hours exchanging stories from our lives, deeper thoughts, and dreams.  
With each passing day, we grew closer and closer. It didn't even take a week before she suggested meeting up. I agreed, but only in a public place. Honestly, I had some doubts and fears, including about my own appearance.  
So the day came when we finally saw each other. We met at a local café to have a private conversation. And in that moment when I saw her, all my concerns vanished. She was even more beautiful in person than in the photo.  
We spent several hours together, and time flew by unnoticed. We laughed, got to know each other better, exchanged tender glances and passionate handshakes. It felt like there was no one else around us, just the two of us, an inseparable couple.  
The story of my online dating experience turned into a true love story. Gradually, our dates became more frequent, and we both realized that our happiness knew no limits.  
Now, when I look back on that day, I am grateful to the dating website that helped us meet. Because sometimes, love can be waiting for us where we least expect it...",ilonason,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15a1v8t/my_dating_history/,1690367115.0,0.83

"Learning to live single around couples… I F22 recently got out of a situation that took about two years of my life. I’m finally single and just trying to learn to be single. I’m not looking for love because i know i’m not ready for a relationship. All my friends around me are in couples and really it was just me and my cousin that were single. Recently she started talking to this guy and I don’t want love to be the basis of our conversations because i’m learning to live without wanting it but am constantly hearing about it. Even my closest friend who is in a relationship rarely talk about it and i appreciate that because honestly i don’t care to hear about it. Anyways i expressed to my cousin that if she’s happy i’m happy but i don’t really want to talk about that she can tell me the good stuff once in a while but for lack of better work, i don’t care. Maybe i’m being selfish but i it’s kind of like if you’re trying to quit cigarettes and are around a whole bunch of people smoking cigarettes. I get this immense pressure that I should probably put myself out there but from the deepest part of my heart I don’t want to. Am I wrong for expressing this?

I have a couple of dating apps and get several likes/matches daily, however, I am afraid to go on any dates due to the fact that I am just way too boring.

Most days I just wake up, trade stocks, go to the gym, then go home and work on my hobbies. On the weekends, I’ll pick a fun car and go out with my camera to beautiful nature spots and take pictures. Most people usually like to go out on the weekends with their friends and party or whatever. For me, it’s the complete opposite…but I just do what makes me happy.

"He was the perpetrator: How does he want to heal? Why do I cause him pain now? I genuinely want to understand. Last year, a guy friend (32M) was very unhappy in his unhealthy, on-and-off 5-year relationship with his girlfriend and approached me (28W) with romantic intentions. I eventually reciprocated his feelings, and we ended up falling deeply in love and thought of each other as ""the one."" But after a year of drama, indecisiveness, and entering and re-entering a toxic cycle with me, he eventually chose to stay with his girlfriend despite wanting to leave her multiple times. 

I believe they're in a codependent relationship and both of them are codependent individuals. His parents, friends, and I think his girlfriend is terrible, and he acknowledges our concerns, but what can we do at this point. 

We just ended our friendship/connection for good until we've both ""healed"" and ""moved on"" and agreed to reach out in 2 years if the conditions are right to see if friendship is possible.

**Since he called himself the perpetrator of this entire mess, I'm genuinely trying to understand:**

1. **What does he mean when he says he needs the time and space to ""heal""?**
2. **Why do I cause him pain now?**
3. This past year was painful for both of us, and he doesn't want to go through another year of hurting and being hurt. **How exactly is he being hurt?**

"My girlfriend is getting more distance, how should I confront her about this? Some backstory, I suggested to my girlfriend that she should make some friends online (as she doesn't go out with friends) and she agreed. This was great, I felt happy that she had someone other than me to hang around. 

That was a few months ago, it started off with only a few hours a week, since then its developed onto a streak of days where she wouldn't communicate with me (except an occasional text every 3-8 hours) I struggle from Anxiety Attachment Disorder (I wouldn't call it a disorder but my therapists named it that so I'm sorry if I have used the wrong term) I have gone to various therapist over the past 4 years for just anxiety and depression in general. Just to make things quick, my father died when I was 12 and I could never say goodbye, this triggered something as since then I always am cautious about family and friends about losing them. 

Apart from all that my Anxiety Attachment issue is mainly towards my Girlfriend, she brought me out of a very awful place in my life and I love her unconditionally for it and therefor she is valued more than anything to me. And with that I become very clingy, which was okay for us majority of the time because she never went anywhere and neither did I. The issue now is that this Anxiety has come back from fear of losing her from distance. I don't want her to stop but it doesn't feel right to not talk to her for days. I know I am defiantly being overdramatic about this but I feel like a second option in our relationship, Her friends come first. Or at least it feels like that.

She is well aware that I have attachment issues and reassures me that everything is going to be alright which I dearly love her for but I mentally can't go on with this streak. It's too little time to spend with each other. It is turning into a few hours a week speaking which especially for me is way too little. 

I want to confront her about it and talk about it like we always do but this is different. She is a very emotional person and the last thing I want to do is make her unhappy. But for the sake of my mental health I need to, I don't want her to stop hanging out with her friends but I'd rather she spend more time with me. She doesn't realize this is happening but its been going on for a while.

As a person with this anxiety, how should I tell my girlfriend that we need to spend more time together and why? (Without making her upset and seem its her fault because it really isn't)

"being one of the few single friends makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me i’m single and have been for a few years. to be fair, i was remote for covid and took a dating hiatus (i hate online dating) but each time i was living at my college i put myself out there and had flings. none of them became more than casual though. i’m only a 22 year old girl so when i think about this on it’s own i feel normal. i’d really like to meet someone one day, but i feel like im young and have a lot of time/places to do so. right now it’s so nice to be independent, long term travel, and plan moving abroad for grad school without being tied down.

I do enjoy the conversations though, he asks very personal stuff and shares personal stuff which is refreshing as I don't have friends to chat to at the moment, and it's stimulating.

"Talking everyday? Long story short: Is it truly a sign of no interest if someone doesn’t check in with you daily after hitting it off well in person and even sleeping together after a few dates?


I’m really taking my time to work on myself while dating.

And I just wondered if in the past I may have demanded too much attention or wether my POV of normal behavior was or isn’t.

So I’d like to know some opinions.

After you spent time with someone, let’s say hypothetically you met someone online, went for dinner hit it off, end up sleeping with them on date 3…. 

Are you supposed to have consistent contact now? I read that if someone is interested they would check in w you daily.  But I’ve had instances where the guys wouldn’t always do that. And I would feel a way because online it says it means he doesn’t care- even when he shows in person that he does.

I’m not talking about ghosting. When I text I get a reply. But is it really a sign of disinterest if someone doesn’t check in every day? 

Or is day 3 regardless of sleeping together still considered “casual” and so it’s more “see ya when I see ya “ I’m just confused on what to look for.

"got ghosted after great 3 days I’m feeling so unconfident all of a sudden

hey guys, just wanna share my story to see what you thinking.
I have been solo traveling for a while and in one place I met this girl, I instantly found attractive and charming. we went out and she got really drunk, we kissed a little bit but I saw her condition I walked her back to the hostel we were in, she said she’s very into me and sorry she was drunk.

the other day she and another friend she met(I know that from her friend) they were talking bout how nice I am and attractive blah blah blah.
In the evening I wanted to know if she’s really interested so I asked the friend and she said totally into me so I was relieved.

The night went on we had fun had sex(she told me she hasn’t done ons or something like that for 4 years) I told her I genuinely like her and she said the same to me.
the day after I had to leave but she stayed there. honestly these 2 days with her felt so great, I never got attached to someone in my trip since I knew it’d end as a one night stand.

she and her friend planned to go together to another destination. she said she missed me in text and wanted me to come with, we were texting for 2 days and 
I sent her a voice messaged (she didn’t hear it) about that I could come to see her but she never opened that text.

I honestly thought I met someone I could make meaningful connection with, and my feelings went with it. I made sure she’s interested as well, but now I feel a little confused since she ghosted me out of the blue..

My girlfriend wants to go to a festival with her ex!? I’ve been friends with this girl for years and after she broke up with her boyfriend of almost 7 years we started hanging out/dating. It’s been 6 months since they broke up but I think they still keep in contact a bit. Her reasoning is that they had tickets to the festival since before they broke up. and they’re just friends. It’s not just the two of them but it is a 4 day camping festival. We aren’t fully offical but I still don’t know if I should allow this??,Johnny55997,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1592hrz/my_girlfriend_wants_to_go_to_a_festival_with_her/,1690274612.0,0.88
"When do you find it acceptable to have sex with someone you are dating? Do you wait for exclusivity? Hi, 

I (21F) am trying to work out how long I should wait before I have sex with a guy (24M) I have been seeing for the past few weeks. There is a lot of sexual chemistry between us both, but I have seen some people say you should wait until 5th date, or until exclusivity has been established, to sleep with someone you are dating. I'm really worried that if I sleep with him too soon, he might lose interest in me.

I have previously slept with partners on the 2nd date, and on the 7th date - and in each case, this had very little to do with why we were incompatible/ why the dating ended. It goes without saying, of course, that in lieu of exclusivity - I would be practising safe sex.

What do you think - should I wait for the 5th date, or for exclusivity, or not wait at all?",anonacc1754,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159mnrn/when_do_you_find_it_acceptable_to_have_sex_with/,1690322686.0,0.8
"What is love? 🎶💞 (Baby don’t hurt me 🙃)

For awhile now, I’ve been struggling to understand what the difference is between platonic love vs romantic love (which is odd to me since I can point out previous partners/exes/relationships I’ve had)

At one point, I thought it might be that they’re both the same but romantic love also involves physical intimacy 💏

&amp; though it might involve being physical, it’s not necessary (asexual folks still have romantic relationships after all plus, the idea that physical attraction is the only difference feels wholly unsatisfactory to my hopeless romantic heart) 💖

Then I thought it might be that the difference comes that in a romantic relationship, those involved would go home to the same house for the rest of their life 🏡

But that just makes it feel like romantic partners are glorified roommates &amp; that too feels like a physical thing and again unsatisfying as an answer to me (though, maybe it’s true?)

For those feeling kind enough to share, I’d  love to hear your thoughts on the matter! ✨(What separates between romantic &amp; platonic love, aka what is the difference between a relationship and a friendship?)",Ser3nd1pity,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159yt1y/what_is_love/,1690356805.0,1.0
"caught feelings from my friend and in the end I had to go end our friendship I met this friend back in janurary. She was a former coworker of mine. throughout our time working together we have gotten close. When i left the company she kept in touch with me. She would call me everyday and we would hangout occasionally. I ended up catching feelings for her. I know she had feelings for me too so in the end i asked her if she wanted to date and she happily agreed. Sadly the timing was bad tho because she had a lot going on in her life. She wasn't in the space to date so in the end we didn't date. At this point I thought I moved on but then when I heard her talking about another guy i realize I still had lingering feelings for her so in the end I ended our friendship so that I could fully move on

I still think about her time to time which shows i really liked her. Sometimes I do question if i made the right choice. I do know she is a good friend and i feel like having someone like her in my life would be good but i don't know what is the best thing. She always made me feel special and I always see that she cares a lot about me so when i ended our friendship i did feel bad and also felt like i lost a good friend

"Being nice is actually affecting me I (22M) have been on a lot of dates and when sometimes the girl starts to think I am just too good for her she starts to tell me you are eventually going to leave me and even if I am not feeling the vibe I have tend to spend a good amount of time just to make sure she isn't upset like by dropping her home or staying extra few hours. 

I feel i dont want to be seen or even create an image about all guys are just rude and shit. And even if i want to ping the any girl i have been on a date she is probably gonna be more than happy to connect with me but the thing is I get mentally drained after doing alot of these efforts. And think do I really need to do this? 

Maybe its because on one of the dates I my my date cry cos she said i was being really sweet, romantic and ""very"" cute (apologies not trying to be an asshole) and that reminded her of her ex which is why she was just meeting new people for hookups to forget about him and was not actually looking for a connection like me. I felt super guilty for some reason and it became one of the worst dates ever. 

Another time, i matched with an older girl (25F), made some imprompt plan to come over but I was a virgin that time so I didn't wanna do something to make her upset so we ended up having a 3 hour long fun chat and went to bed, we were almost about to sleep i looked at her and came close and we kissed and when i started to take her dress off she said, I never had sex before, which i knew was a lie, but we agreed to do 3rd base and i could see here getting little not comfortable and we decided to let it go. I was just mad and wasn't able to finish either so i went to bed. Then for some reason i made her breakfast and made sure she reaches her home cos she was new to the city. When i discussed this with my friend he told, we are not supposed to do all these and its okay to just ask her to leave in the morning. I don't agree with that. I got alot of messages for that girl saying you're the sweetest of all the people, thank you for the night, etc. Tho i never replied to her.

Honestly I have happy that i am able to do good for them but its just that do i really need to make all these efforts just to make them feel good and get upset and think im just another jerk who's just trying to get in bed.

"Where may I find women who do not care about looks/height? I'm 5'3"" and 21 (senior in college). How ought I go about dating at my height?
I realize height is extremely important to women and they consider short guys to be ugly; that's fine, it's their life, their prerogative. I've made my peace.

But there is always the advice for short men to go for ""women who are not shallow"" but how does one go about that? Where may I find said women?

I just wanna clarify that I do not care about looks (would be very hypocritical of me if I did lol) at all in women be it body, face, makeup, hair on head or that on body. Just being hygienic regarding bathing and brushing their teeth is enough.

I'd say I'm a good, kind person, I'm as hygienic as one can be, I try to make people smile or laugh as much as I can, am into soccer, critically viewing movies and shows, writing, read a lot, am taking Spanish class to learn the language, learning how to play guitar.

"Women: Ask the men for exclusivity instead of making theories about what you are. I genuinely want to help with this post and I think it's important that women take some moment to really think about their situations with men.

I see this time and time again. Women asking here on the forum about what to do in their current situation with a guy and it's always the same type of posts and the same type of answers.

The woman is invested, \*KNOWS\* how she feels, \*KNOWS\* what she wants and instead of communicating that directly to the guy about whatever troubles her heart or wanting exclusivity in a firm manner where she lets him know that if he's not going to give it she's looking to end it.

Instead of doing that... She comes out here seeking advice and all the advice from other women is the same: ''block him'', ''drop him'', ''he seems like a player'', ''this happened to me as well and was very hurtful''.

Just hurt women give hurt advice.

You don't know if he's a player or whatever he is until you ASK, it's when you ask and you're firm about it and show him that you're serious that you'll see his real intentions. You'll see it in his actions.

The last thing I want to say which nowadays for some reason isn't politically correct: It's the woman's job to seek exclusivity. It's been like that since the beginning of time.

Think about it... You're beautiful. Sought after by a lot of men, getting a lot of interest and so on... And here comes a man who for whatever reason is the main option for you. He passed all the tests, whether it was his looks or his way of communicating or his energy or all of them combined. He essentially was better than everyone else. He probably did some form of pursuing until he got intimacy, now after intimacy it's on you to keep him.

Or as women do you want the men to do everything? Pursue you to get you, and pursue you to keep you after intimacy? Like it literally doesn't make any sense if you think about it.

Also furthermore what a lot of women don't understand is that you're probably dating the top 20-30% of men who have a lot of options. If you're on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge or even going down to the local bar. You're not going to go with the boring/dry or not so attractive men. You're probably going to be with the men whom many different women like. If they're attractive to you and likable to you then they also appear that way to other women.

These men are already getting both invites to relationships frequently and women who want to spend time or date casually and so you're always in direct competition with these women.

At the end my final advice is this: if you meet a man and you don't care that's fine do whatever you want, but if you met a guy who essentially is the main guy for you and you are invested pursue him and communicate with him. You literally have nothing to lose. You'll only find out if he's the real guy for you by his actions afterwards.

Also some of us men need that. I needed my ex girl to communicate with me frequently and pursue me for a relationship. I had no clue whether she was playing me or not. Like quite literally, no clue. I needed to see her efforts over time. I was already attracted to her and enjoyed her company more than the other girls I was seeing at that time (we were not exclusive in the first 1-2 months)

Her doing what I felt was the job of the feminine made her stand out from all the other women because it showed me that she was a good girl. That instead of her playing the field and not caring and doing the ''female player'' type of thing she was actually interested in something real.

One of the big reasons for me going exclusive with her besides actually liking her and enjoying her company was that she was persistent and feminine. Showing me time and time again over the period of 1-2 months that her feelings was invested and she really wanted this to go somewhere.

In the end we ended for some different reasons two years later, but at least it was a fun ride.",abbehardy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15a0rro/women_ask_the_men_for_exclusivity_instead_of/,1690363614.0,0.57
"I need advice from people on what to do I will make this as short as possible. I have been with my gf (22) for over a year. I (22) male used to have sex on a daily basis whenever we saw each other. A few months ago she went through something scary relating to self harm. I took her to the hospital. She has been better and getting treatment and taking anti-depressants. For the last two and a half months, we have not been intimate. Listen, before anyone says anything. First month I understood and just held her and was there. Second month was harder and we had a talk about it as its important to me. The last half month, she said and keeps saying idk, or I am scared. I reassure her it is okay and we can take it slow. She recently said she has no desire to have intimacy anymore and that upset me and it is partially due to the meds (which I fully get). But she has not kissed me, touched me, or done anything more than two times in that time span. I love her to death. She was in a abusive relationship in high school and it still affects her. I just do not know what to do anymore. I do not want to break up with her or pressure her, but I feel like an ass because my patience feels like it is getting to the point. For every one steps forward its one step back.

"Girl has gone cold on me. How do I approach this situation? Hi Guys, I was hoping I could get some advice on how to approach a situation with a woman I'm interested in.   
  
So I recently began talking to this woman on Hinge (she's 29 and im 35). We spoke for a couple of days and I asked for her phone number. She said she wasn't comfortable giving her number out just yet but offered to talk to me on Instagram, which I was fine with, so we followed each other and began talking there.  Turns out we share a mutual friend too, who we are both good friends with (another female).   
  
It's not often I click with people online as I'm very particular with what I'm looking for in a life partner, but this girl really got my attention. She's really cute, polite, smart, respectful, really sweet and we share the same core values, beliefs and morals.   
  
She wasn't a big conversationalist, I did find that I had to always initiate, but she was always responsive, would apologise if she took a while to respond and explain why (she didn't need to do this but I appreciated it and found it respectful), she was really sweet and would always be very appreciative of my efforts, for example I asked to if I could give her a call later that evening one day and she said that would be nice. When that evening came and I offered to call, she said she wasn't up for it that night due to a personal situation that day and wasn't in the right head space and asked if we could do it another time. I said of course, totally understand, told her I would be up for a while longer and if she felt like texting me about it she's more than welcome, otherwise I would message her the next day.   
  
She thanked me for being understanding, and she ended up opening up to me through text for the next hour or so.   
  
After a few days of talking on insta and no phone call, just voice notes here and there (she's a shift worker so it was hard to get access to her when I wanted), I just simply asked her out. She said yes, although she was busy that weekend so she said we could meet up the following week. I said no problem, happy to work around your schedule.   
  
The following week I followed up with her on Thursday to see if she's given any more thought as to when she's like to see me and sent her a link to an event that was currently on and asked her if she'd like to go with me. She said she loves activity dates and would love to go with me, and asked if we could go that night as she had plans over the weekend, which I said yes.   
  
She asked if she could drive to my place and we go together as she thought it would be stressful trying to find me in a big crowd, so I offered to pick her up instead so she didn't have to drive all the way to mine as long as she was comfortable with that. She said she didn't mind, as long as I was okay with it as it was a long drive and she felt bad. I said it was no problem for me and I was happy to do it. I gave her a time that I would be there and booked tickets. She thanked me for being so accommodating and said I was really sweet.   
  
Fast forward to the date, both of us had a really great time. We got to do a fun activity together which allowed us time to talk and get to know each other, and it's probably one of the better dates I had. At the end of the night when I dropped her off home, I walked her to her front door and she gave me a hug, thanked me for the evening and told me she had such a great time and asked if she could see me again soon. I said I would love to.   
  
The following morning I texted her, thanked her for coming and asked if she would like to to go the zoo with me (it's something we spoke about in the car). She thanked me for a wonderful evening again and told me she had a great time and that she would love to go to the zoo with me (with a smiley emoji), and I asked if she wanted to go the following weekend, as she was busy that weekend. She said she can, and I asked her what day suits her best and she said she would let me know and get back to me, with a smiley face and heart emoji.   
  
Later that evening I knew she had an event on, so I sent her a simple text saying I know you're out tonight but I just wanted to wish you a great evening and I hope you've had a lovely day. She thanked me and said that she may not be able to respond that evening as she would be busy. I said no problem at all, no need to respond tonight, I know you're busy, just wanted to wish you a great evening. Talk to you whenever you're free.  
  
The next day she messages me at 5pm, apologises for getting back to me late and then said her dad had a heart attack the night before.  
  
Now before I continue, for context, she doesn't really have a relationship with her dad due to something that happened 2 years ago (her dad was the one who stopped speaking to her).   
  
She said she didn't know what her movements would be like next week as her dad needs a triple bypass and will be in the hospital for a bit.   
  
I replied back and said that I was sorry this happened and that I hope her dad will be okay. Told her I was sad for her and not to worry, we can go to the zoo whenever she's up for it. Asked her if there was anything I could do and if she wanted to talk about it. She said not to worry, and that she's not close with him, however he is still her dad and that she needs to be there for him physically to assist.   
  
I replied and said I totally understand, and to do what she needs to do. I told her I was heading out shortly but to text me if she wanted to talk, and thanked her for letting me know. She left me on seen. I thought this was odd but didn't read too much into it.   
  
Admittedly, I was pretty bummed out as I genuinely really like this girl and I was honestly not sure if she was blowing me off or if she was being legit, as I'm not quite sure how invested she is in this situation. Nonetheless, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and carried on.  
  
The next morning I sent her a voice note just asking how she's feeling and that I had to rush out the previous night so didn't get to talk to her properly, but asked if she was okay and how was she doing. She left me on seen again.   
  
I thought no biggie, she may be out and can't listen to it. Not an issue (not the first time I've sent her a voice note).   
  
She was at a kids birthday party that day (she posted it on her story), so I figured she's just busy and would reply to me later. Nope, nothing. Waited until the next day and still nothing, even though she posted another insta story in that time.   
  
I texted her at 5:30pm and said 'Hey \*\*\*\*\*, just wanted to check in with you and see if you're okay as I never heard back. I hope everything is okay, and I hope you had a wonderful weekend 😊'  
  
She replied and said 'Sorry I’ve been with my dad and now I’m prepping for my night shifts this week so I will continue to be a little MIA'.  
  
I replied 'Ah ok fair enough! I understand. I'll give you some space. I hope your dad's surgery was successful. I'll just touch base with you in a few days. In the meantime, if you feel like talking, feel free to message me'.   
  
She left me on seen again.   
  
I don't know if I'm just overthinking this, but her coldness towards me seems rather strange and out of character. I get she may be going through a difficult time, but I'm struggling to tell if it's just that, or if she's no longer interested for whatever reason. I'm just not sure how to proceed from here. Do I reach out in a few days, or just leave her be?  
  
I feel really bummed out as I really like this girl and would love to go on another date with her, but I'm not sure where I stand and it's driving me nuts. I would honestly just love to know if she's still keen, but I'm not sure how to approach her to get that answer without coming across as insensitive to her situation and potentially ruining my chances if a second date is still on the cards.

"Childhood traumas = difficulty in dating I'm (24F) the eldest sibling and I'm the only one single. My twin brothers are only a year younger than me and are already in years long serious relationships--like wedding bells ringing in the distance kind of relationships. 

I've never been in one so I'm kinda jealous. Every time I dip my toes in the waters, I back out. I always go back to the memories of my father hurting my mother physically and my mother hurting him verbally and psychologically. This happened when I was in highschool. Every night I wake up to them almost killing each other in their fights. I was the only one who witnessed it since I'm a light sleeper. My brothers sleep thru any disaster imaginable. I swear someone was trying rob our house, there were footsteps clanging on the roof, they're dead asleep. We had a major earthquake around 5 something intensity, dead asleep. I think that's why I only had this and they turned out fine.

Every teeny tiny sign of similar characteristic of my parents, it's like my eyes flash forward to how this man can potentially react to my words, my behavior, my humor, my expression, anything to eventually hurting me. Or that time when someone liked me and I tried to open up to them; I got scared that somehow I might end up hurting them by acting like how my parents did to each other. So it's a never ending cycle of me being scared of the possibility that I become vulnerable enough for them to hurt me or me hurting them. 

Aside from that I tried really hard to put myself out there like I joined parties and travelled. I also use dating apps but it's tiring to introduce yourself and talk menial things and then repeat for the next match.

"What do I do when I’m the problem? I’m 22F and have been with my 22M boyfriend for about a year and a half. We’ve had our ups and downs, but are doing very well at the moment. The problem, though, is that the majority (90%+) of these “ups and downs”/ arguments / any general relationship unpleasantness comes as a result of my mental health problems. 

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and am prone to anxiety attacks and overstimulation that often cause me to behave visibly strangely and awkwardly. I have a horrible tendency to get overwhelmed and snap at my boyfriend, saying things to him in the moment that I know are unkind or uncalled for. I am also highly anxious-attachment, codependent, and sensitive. I am fully aware of all this, go to therapy for it, and am extremely displeased with how my actions affect him. I’ve improved slightly over time, but nothing major. 

We’ve spoken at length about this, and his most recent take on it was the (true) statement that relationships are never exactly 50-50, and that he’s willing to be there for me when I’m having a difficult time (which is almost all the time. We joke about wanting to have a “normal” day out without some kind of disturbance from my mental health issues). I love him and we care deeply about each other, but I’m concerned that I’m truly holding him back and he is just taking it like a champ in the name of being supportive in our relationship.

"Approach Advice: Going Out with a Co-Worker I have a crush on my co-worker. She had a boyfriend when we first met, but they seem to be no longer together. The unfortunate caveat is that she is primarily a remote worker, which limits our in-person interactions. Our conversations, albeit infrequent due to our different teams (around once monthly), are always engaging and can last up to two hours.  


  
How should I get closer to her outside of work? My connection with numerous teammates extends beyond work, although they belong to a distinct social group that she might not easily assimilate into. The challenge I face presently is my apprehension about initiating non-work interactions and that I might get too conspicuous how what I feel.  


  
How should I transition from ""work-friend"" to ""girlfriend""? Ideally, I would want to hang out with her a few times outside a professional setting before asking her out.",tinderdating23,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159z4qd/approach_advice_going_out_with_a_coworker/,1690357953.0,1.0

"""dad bods"" versus ""fit"" is extremely dependent My actual question is what makes a ""dad bod"" attractive to you versus a man who is in great shape? Not a body builder. Not a man with bulging muscles or ultra defined abs. But just a dude who is in good shape overall and his body proves it.

WARNING: I like to write and get too detailed sometimes but like to give as much info as possible! This is also going to sound super narcissistic but it is what it is so judge me if you want! ;)

I'm curious because I, as a man (mid 30s,) have one which is entirely due to beer and pad thai lol. So I have a belly but it's not what you imagine. It's there. It's obvious if I want it to be. Overall I LOOK macular and in shape/athletic. Technically I'm overweight for my height (5'10"") but enough to carry a ""dad bod."" It's incredibly interesting how like 95% of women literally don't care. 

Ok, minus the belly/dad bod I do have a very very attractive face so that probably helps... But I've never had issues dating, hooking up, etc... with women who are petite, super athletic/fit, or skinny and objectively ""hot"" or gorgeous by society ""standards,"" despite me clearly being out of shape. I do have a very charming, flirty and funny personality so I suppose that also helps but, you'd think a 5'5"" 120lb super fit woman would want nothing to do with a 5'10"" 210lb guy who is obviously out of shape lol. Apparently that's not the case - at least for me.

I was blessed with amazing genes, both physically (especially physically) and mentally/academically - CompSci from MIT if you are - so, I've *always* been super naturally muscular and just have an ultra athletic build. Extra weight or not. I carry it extremely well. So maybe it's just my genes/natural physique, idk... but I'm far from in shape or ""muscular"" now but I still *look* like I am. I know that doesn't make any sense but I have a dad bod 100% lol. So I guess you could say a muscular in shape looking dad-bod?

Anyways, I have lurked on all the dating sub reddits here for a long time and one thing that people always say to men struggling with women is ""go to they gym,"" ""lose weight"" ""lower your standards,"" etc... which is always a GREAT idea! But, that's not IMO the solution to being successful with women. It'll likely attract more women but, then again I'm some dude with a beer belly and I do just fine! If I lost 10-15 pounds then idk what I'd do with women.

So, what and/or why do you like ""dad-bods?"" What makes them attractive to you?",Former-Corner-4446,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159u96u/dad_bods_versus_fit_is_extremely_dependent/,1690342191.0,0.75

"Bf was unfaithful once, I don’t know what to do. Looking for advice Not sure if it’s the right place to post this but here it goes, 
My bf (31m) and I (24f) have been together for 2 years, long distance. I found nudes of a woman in his deleted album when he left his phone unlocked downstairs one night. (Not proud that I snooped) I know he didn’t take them himself because we had an app that tracks locations at all times and he was never suspicious. He told me that it was a woman he used to sext on WhatsApp a year before we started dating (she lives in another country). He never heard from her until that night when she told him that she visited the States and he responded. Then she said to him, “ I have a gift for you.”, the nudes were followed. He said their convo last for a duration of 8 hours (with a total of roughly 15 text messages since he works at night). He admitted sending selfies back to her but realized right after what he did was wrong and shut it down - deleted everything (chat and photos) and went to bed. WhatsApp has a feature that saves photos to album it not turned off manually. 

I’m contemplating on what to do next, I want to forgive him but tell me if I’m being naive: 
- it’s been over 8 months since it’s happened and his story has never changed. 
- He’s also got rid of all social media and messaging apps.
- Reassumes me that he’s 100% faithful to me. 
- What I can’t quite give through is that he sent selfies back to her, though he immediately realized what he did was wrong. 
I want to move past this because he’s shown great effort since the very beginning of our relationship, and still does. His work is hectic and he always prioritizes spending time with me. He said that he made a terrible mistake, but he corrected himself right after and shut it down, never let it happen again. He told me that he’s grateful for this incident because it’s shown him that he was weak at the moment and lost sight of who he is, and that he needed to be better. 

I honestly don’t know.. I’ve never been betrayed before. I want to believe that people make mistakes and learn from them, but I hope I’m not being too naive.

"How To Date in Career Limbo? For context I am a 23 yr old who graduated college last year, casually ""dated"" in the past, but no long term relationships. In general I have not been focused on finding a partner as I was always busy with the pre-med-life. I applied to med school last year, and received no acceptances, I plan to apply again and I would be 25 by the time I start. I feel pretty insecure about my situation, which comes from a lot of internal feelings of failure and anxiety regarding med school and my place in the future due to the uncertainty that comes with applying.

I feel like it's affecting me and how I feel in regards to dating. In general I find it hard to get past this idea that someone would find me a suitable partner, when many individuals my age (and in my dating rage) have an actual career or are more established in life (or will be). I know that from past experiences on dates that most people haven't seemed to concerned with it, but it's personally hard to get past.

"Is he (24m) still interested in me (23f)? I (23f) met this guy (24m) at a party. We ended up hooking up. Prior to that, I disclosed that I was hsv positive. He had no problem with this and we hooked up a few times that night and I slept over at his place. He bought me breakfast the next morning and held my hand the whole day when we were hanging out.

We vibed really well mentally and physically. I was excited to see him again after he drove me home. We then talked every day for over a week. He offered to take me to return some items this week since I don’t have a car and wanted to give me some extra decor he had for my apartment, since I just moved. Very kind so far.

This was a really good experience for me since I have had a hard time with disclosures. He later mentioned again he had no issue with it. As we kept talking, I asked him if he would be interested in seeing me again, to which he said he would be very interested.

But now I haven’t heard from him for two days. This wouldn’t be an issue for me as I thought he was just busy with work, but he’s viewing my stories and posting, so that leads me to believe he’s not too busy to send a quick text.

"What can I do to improve my dating life? Hello. I am a 20-year-old straight guy who's super frustrated with my dating life. It feels like every time I am interested in or find a girl attractive I either get rejected or get led on. I wholeheartedly believe that I am attractive and have been told by many of my friends (guys and girls) for the past couple of years that I am handsome, smart, funny, and overall a catch, but it just doesn't seem that the girls I am interested in ever give me the time of day. FWIW, I am just over 6 feet tall, have straight white teeth (never needed braces or anything), have clear skin (I literally have been doing a 15-minute skincare routine every single night before going to bed since I was 18), and I also believe that I am generally a sociable person. I have very good hygiene and have been told many times by several of my friends and family that I smell good and dress well. I have been working out a TON over the last couple of years trying to level up and have put on a good amount of muscle compared to when I was 17. Working out has significantly improved my mental health and self-worth, but it just sucks knowing in the back of my head that I'm so frustrated with my dating life and that I am always lonely. It feels like I am never enough.  
The thing that is frustrating is that literally every time I see and approach a cute girl I always get the same old ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""Sorry, I'm not looking for that right now"". It's especially sad and makes me miserable because I've been rejected so many times that 95 % of the time when I hear something like this nowadays I can see straight thru the BS in the sense that these women are just trying to let me off easy by making up an excuse. I feel that I am very selective in the girls that I approach (I make sure that they seem single I know that you can't always tell if you just see a girl in public, but I've gotten good at figuring it out for the most part and I also try to make eye contact prior to approaching them), but I am still shooting my shot a lot so it's not like the sample size is small. For reference, this month (July 2023) I can literally think of 27 different girls that I have cold approached and only gotten 2 numbers from those interactions. And those two numbers led to me just being ghosted right off the bat (no response to my first ""Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from \[where we met\]"" text). It's just overly frustrating going through this never-ending cycle and just thinking about it makes me feel miserable. I'll use my latest cold approach as an example. I saw a super attractive girl at my gym yesterday, so I made eye contact with her briefly when I first saw her. Then, later on in my workout I went to the water fountain and was passing by her (we were walking past each other) and I pulled out my earbuds and struck up a quick conversation with her. The conversation was fine nothing out of the ordinary just basic gym small talk, and I maintained eye contact the entire time. After about 45 seconds of chatting, I said something along the lines of, ""Well, I've gotta head out soon it was nice talking to you. I'd like to get to know you better, may I get your number?"" To which she hit me with the dreadful, ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend."" I am basically positive that this girl is single. Also, there was nothing in the conversation that could have shown me that she was not interested. She was making eye contact the entire time. Her body language was more open and facing toward me (all the Youtube videos I've watched aimlessly hoping to fix my dating life have always talked about this), and she asked me a question or two in the conversation which I thought maybe meant she was at least interested in getting to know me at the very least. I guess she was just being friendly. I go into these approaches feeling confident almost like the mentality that ""this girl would be honored to have a piece of this"", but it just doesn't seem to make a difference in the outcome. By the way, the confidence isn't faked. I have genuinely been feeling very confident and comfortable in my skin, especially over the past few years. However, it just eats at me on the inside that I am lonely and not able to secure a date with a girl that I find attractive. Literally, all I want is a chance to get to know and take a girl I find attractive out on a date.  
One thing I haven't mentioned yet that's always been in the back of my mind is that I am of Indian descent. I was born, raised, and currently live in the United States. The girls I am interested in the most part are white girls and maybe some Latinas here and there. I don't know why, but those are really the only girls that I find attractive. Does this have anything to do with my experiences? I feel that anytime I flirt with an Indian girl they are almost always interested, but I can't ever seem to get that level of interest in the girls I am attracted to (white girls). Is there anything I can do about this? I've been constantly told by my white friends (guys and girls) that my race doesn't matter and that girls don't really care, but it's really hard for me to believe that with my experiences. I just feel miserable especially because I always see shorter, less attractive white guys having no problem in dating the girls I find attractive.  
Several months ago, my family and I went to the west coast for vacation (Arizona area), and I was getting significantly more matches with girls I found attractive than I ever had back home. Is it maybe where I live that could be the problem? Maybe these white girls I'm approaching all the time have some racism instilled in them still. Is that what's up? I always thought being in the 21st century that racism would be a thing of the past. Is that really the case though?  
I can anticipate all of the comments saying that I may be coming off as too desperate and needy, but I can guarantee you that is not the case. I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, this guy is just not self-aware."" I promise you that I am not putting a relationship on a pedestal. In fact, my goal for my twenties is to level myself up and build my career. However, I am still extremely frustrated with my results in the sense that I want to improve my game so that I can someday have what I desire. It's just really messing with my head, and I need an outsider's perspective on how to fix it.  
I am not expecting you all to solve my dating woes, but I would really appreciate any feedback you all have for me. I have decided that I am going to continue leveling myself up in the gym, career-wise, etc. in the meantime, but at the end of the day, I would really love to find someone that I am attracted to share it all with.  
Sorry for the super long write up guys, but I just really wanted to give you all a good understanding of how I am feeling and what's been going through my mind.

"girlfriend(22f) seems fond of my friend (21m) and friend seems interested in my gf lol I (22m) went to a chill house party with my girlfriend(22f) and my friend(21m) from uni. girlfriend met him for the first time. my girlfriend found him funny. she told me multiple times throughout the night that he is very funny. which I know, otherwise I wouldn't be his friend innit. I'm not trying to be a hater but she even laughed at jokes that weren't funny. a proper laugh too not a ""oh let's give a polite laugh to not make it awkward"" we went to get McDonald's cos we we're hungry. I was waiting for mine and my gfs order and she went to go sit down w my friend. they sat across from eachother and spoke about whatever I'm not sure. we were eating and we spoke career and taxes and being there for our kids vs working away from home and not seeing the kids for some months. (we both don't have kids it was just a hypothetical topic for when we have kids in the future). we spoke a bunch but my gf cut me off a few times while I was adding to the conversation. usually when she does this she at least comes back to me and apologizes and asks what I had said. but this time she was  blatant abt it . and just carried on the convo w my friend. I also recall my friend saying something abt me only having 2 friends (not sure how it got there, but it lowkey seemed like he tried putting me down now that I think of it) then my gf added to it by saying ""yeh the only two friends are sitting at this table"". I found  it funny but saw it as a v weird remark at the same time from both, my gf esp. they both laughed ofc. I could be overthinking it bcs it was a low blow and it probably was just banter but I didn't make fun of anyone at the table I was chilling. I didn't think too much of all of it. but I definitely took note. 

later at the place I recall him saying something along the lines of ""don't let me steal your girl away"" not those words exactly but it had a similar 'oomf'. was very weird I just looked and ignored what he said.  my gf was right next to me too so I'm sure she heard it too but she said nothing abt it. didn't expect her to in that moment, but I kinda expected her to bring it up the next day. but ig she didn't find that as weird as I did.

I wasn't phased by it that night, cos I couldn't care less. ik where my gf stands w me. even if I caught my friend looking at my gf every now and then lol.

But td out the blue my gf asks me
 ""what does 'friends name' think of me?""
I reply ""why do you care lol""
""nah I don't care""
""then why are you thinking abt it?""
""i meant to say, 'what does he think of me for you?'""
""idk"" 
she went to sleep after my reply 

this part is probably not much to think of but it's what made me make this post to see what you experts think of this situation.

Do u think it wise to bring this up to my girlfriend or will it make me seem insecure?

is this normal on relationships? it's it something you just have to get over?

why do ppl take digs at me when I haven't treated then abt such way?

yes i dont have many friends and this is kinda why lol

"Am I the asshole? I cheated on my boyfriend and we got back together. My boyfriend, james, and I have been dating a little over a year now. So to explain the situation, I have been doing substances such as marijuana and alcohol for many years, I do it to relieve stress and it’s become a habit for when I’m upset, or just anytime I crave it. My boyfriend is a religious guy, and is extremely against the use of these substances. “I don’t even consider them human”-James
When my boyfriend and I met, I knew straight away that I liked him and he knew straight away that he loved me, I chose to attempt to quit alcohol and marijuana for him to keep us together. 
Although, I quit the substances for a month, and I ended up doing the substances without his knowledge for the next 2 months. I continued to lie to him and tell him that I was not doing it in order to save our relationship, because if he knew he would break up with me. Though a big part of this lie was because I was struggling very much and I felt that he wouldn’t be able to understand where I was coming from if I did start these substances again, we never hangout, we basically have a long distance relationship because of his strict parents, so I didn’t have the full support I needed to get past my issue. my sister had died and I was the one to preform CPR on her, then my dad abandoned me leaving me with my grandmother is what caused me to start again.  
After a rough argument with James, I decided to go to a party with my friends without his knowledge. At this party I got blackout drunk and kissed another girl in a game of spin the bottle(I am a straight female), somebody at the party recorded the video and sent it to James. I apologized profusely, and I still do till this very  day, and I feel so horrible for it. The next day he broke up with me and I had a seizure, the next Monday I went to school and brought weed and got suspended, then I moved out of the town to live with my mom. 

We talked everyday for 3 weeks and then decided to get Back together, the reason he got back with me was because he still loved me and he didn’t want me to attempt suicide again, start marijuana and alcohol, and because of my seizure. I feel that this whole situation has helped our relationship grow so much now, we are both completely open with each other, and I actually have quit the substances now. 

Though, throughout our whole entire relationship I’ve been suspicious of one girl in his friends group, Amy(he used to like her and they are around each other more than him and I were, plus she looked exactly like me). James would tell me every little interaction that they had, it was obvious flirting but he continued to deny that he liked her.
Months after James and I started to date again, we were texting all night, then suddenly Amy texted him and asked James to come over and cuddle and stuff. James left our conversation to go talk with her, during their talk he called me because I was angry and said I was going to sleep, but he continued to text her. I then hung up the phone to see how long it took him to choose me. After a good 30 minutes, he texted me having a panic attack, so I called him to make sure he was safe and okay, he told me that they had both confessed their feelings to each other, and told me that he did like Amy too. He asked me if I wanted him to block Amy, I said it was his choice who he really wants here so it was up for him to decide that, 2 days later he blocked her.

I’ve been talking to this guy (30 and I’m 28F) for a couple of weeks, we had met up twice prior, had a brief date the first time and made out for a while the second time. 

He continued messaging me and flirting with me, usually he’d message me first. I’d tried to get the hookup going once or twice but there were scheduling conflicts and once he cancelled on me rather suddenly but hey, it’s casual and nbd right?

Then yesterday he’s chatting with me and sweet talking to me, cool. Like I said this is a casual thing, he’s only visiting my town, so a purely physical relationship is what I anticipated. Just to be clear on my “expectations” here. 

He asks if I want him to come over last night around 11, I say yes. Literally 20 minutes later, after he said he was getting in the car, he messaged me saying “I can’t come sorry” and then he blocked me on messenger????

I am so confused. I didn’t invite him over, he asked ME, so I have no clue why he’d ghost me or block if he was interested? I would legit understand it more if we’d already hooked up, like oh I guess he got what he wanted—but he literally blocked me BEFORE he got what he wanted? All he got out of me was the making out and then one slightly racy photo, not even a nude. 

Anyone have insight??? I am absolutely thrown rn.",cinnamonspiderr,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1599p65/blocked_less_than_an_hour_before_hooking_up/,1690294389.0,0.75

"I hated my first date I went on my very first date a week before I left campus for summer break. I met the guy on Bumble and after a couple days of talking he asked me if I wanted to hang out at his apartment. I didn’t think it was weird since his apartment was near my dorm and we went to the same university. However, I wasn’t able to go the day he wanted me to since I had some finals that week, so I asked him if he wanted to go to one my favorite restaurants nearby the week after. He said sure, and I planned a whole day for us. I planned out the place to eat, the trail we would go on a walk on and watching a movie afterwards. He agreed to everything. 
We set a date to meet on a Friday, a week after he asked me to come over. I was really excited, I did my hair, I wore nice clothes and wore pretty jewelry. I was also so nervous because we texted for two weeks and he seemed like such a chill guy I thought I might be too much for him so I calmed myself down when he texted, telling me he was downstairs, waiting in the lobby of my residence building. When I went downstairs I was immediately disappointed. Not about his looks, since he looked exactly like his pictures, but his attitude and mannerisms. I tried to talk to him, I started off by saying “hi, it’s nice to meet you” and he said “yeah you too” but he started walking away. I think he expected me to follow him, but I was the one who knew where the restaurant was so it was just awkward. 
We did end up walking and making small talk on the way to the restaurant and I asked him if he still wanted to the get the special menu item because I was looking forward to seeing him eat it after texting about it. He said yeah but as soon as we order he gets mac and cheese balls and fried chicken. He tells me that he’ll pay for his meal and I could pay for mine and I said that’s fine, but then I remembered that I was the one who recommended to eat here so I felt like I should pay. We ate and I listened to him talk for most of the time, and eventually he was “done eating”. I think he took about 3 bites of his food and was ready to throw it away. I told him that the server could give him a to-go box but he said he didn’t need it and just threw it away. Wasting food is a pet peeve of mine and I wanted to leave. 
I was annoyed at that point and needed to clear my head so I asked him if he wanted to go on a walk. He seemed like he was getting restless and he kept saying “maybe we should just go straight to my place to watch that movie”. I really just wanted to go on a walk so I told him we could go after. We walked for a bit and he kept telling me what he would do with other girls he went on dates with, like sexual experiences he had with them. Then he asked me if I was on birth control or if I have sex and if I meet guys regularly. I thought these were weird questions because I wasn’t even on that topic. 
He decided that he wanted to head back but I realized how uncomfortable I was so I asked him if I could get back to my dorm to change. I was wearing a cardigan with a deep v-neck and I just thought I should change into a crew neck since it covered me more. After I changed, he told me we should start heading to his place to watch the movie. I told him we could watch the movie here, since in my residence floor we had a lounge area and nobody was in there. He insisted we go to his place and I honestly didn’t know how to say no. 
I ended up going and got to his place. I automatically felt uneasy. I felt a little better when I realized he had four roommates and they all seemed to be home. He opened the door to his room and it was filthy. Food all over the desk and ground, wrappers, notebooks and pencils all over. Nothing was in place but surprisingly, his bed was made. He laid down and told me to come cuddle with him. I felt very weird so I just sat up on the bed next to him so he sighed and ended up sitting too. He started the movie and he had his arm around me, he was playing with my hair and caressing my neck but I just didn’t like it. I felt his arm on my back and I felt like I was hurting his arm so got up to ask if I was. He said no and suddenly asked me if I wanted to make out with him. I said no not right now. He said “that’s okay, I respect women.” I thought he was being weird because he didn’t act like this when we were in public. He kept touching me, around my thigh and shoulder but I made sure nothing else happened. I ended up staying through the whole movie and he made a joke at the end. I didn’t hear or understand what he said so I asked him. He just said never mind but he sounded angry. Eventually, he told me he would walk me to the bus stop. At the end I asked him if he had fun, he said yeah, and I asked him what he thought of me. He said he thought I was hot… finally the bus came and I left. 
I decided to get off the bus after a couple stops. I walked the rest of the way and got back to my dorm and cried. I was so frustrated with myself for wasting a day that I could’ve spent alone. I felt like I was baby sitting the entire time in public but scared to say the wrong thing when I was at his place. I tried to keep an open mind but I don’t want to see him again.",Rice360,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159qhy6/i_hated_my_first_date/,1690331795.0,1.0

"Ex initiated contact after I went NC and then left me on read I dated this girl for more than a year. We’re both in our late twenties. We behaved like a couple, though we never committed - mainly because she didn’t want to. We distanced each other and she started treating me like her last option, but she didn’t want to lose me either. I got tired of the situation and told her not to speak to me again, at least during some months. She understood and agreed.

Fast forward 10 days, and she replies to my instagram story with a sad emoji - to which I reply something along the lines of “what’s wrong? Do you miss me?” She read it, but hasn’t replied.

Honestly, I’m quite angry. It was already challenging for me to cut her off, and then she does this kind of stuff. Not only does she disrespect my boundaries, but then leaves me on read? Is this a power play? Because she’s always been quite honest and mature in her communication. However, now I’m doubting everything she’s done in the past. It baffles me.

If she wanted me to pursue her with this, she’s managed to push me further away.",grazie_antonio,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159v2as/ex_initiated_contact_after_i_went_nc_and_then/,1690344559.0,1.0

"Anyone else tired of the excessive location bullshit on dating apps? I'm so tired of literally being FORCED to put my location on every single time I use the app. Like just fuck off already. You already have my fuckin location; save it and use it. 

I understand all the excuses about ""it's like this because there's so many catfish accounts""... it doesn't make it any better. If humans could quit acting so shitty where they need to constantly spam and scam everyone, everywhere, all the time, then this wouldn't be an issue. 

Two of the biggest culprits I'm seeing atm with this are Tinder and Bumble. But shits definitely on other apps too. Shit even apps that AREN'T dating apps are forcing locations (like weather apps). 

Just let people choose their damn location. Quit forcing me to turn location on just to simply USE the app for anything. I sidestep these apps on purpose but when they're the predominant apps people use, it isn't really possible just not trying it. 

Again, like I said, I understand why they do it, but they shouldn't HAVE to do it. 

And then all these apps and their bullshit subscriptions. Like quit putting everything behind a damn paywall. Everything is a way to capitalize/profit from you nowadays and it's ridiculous. I will never, ever pay for a damn dating app and honestly NOBODY should. It shouldn't even be a thing. If people quit falling into their exploitive practices, and didn't just toss away money every opportunity they have, maybe these companies would finally see that and change could happen. 

Not every single thing on earth needs to become a subscription. Quit exploiting people's loneliness and desperation for your own profit. It's ridiculous more people don't see this. Or care. 

Lol you can't even see the people that liked you on these apps without paying and that's literally redundant to the whole point of dating. Same with the apps that prevent you from simply messaging. It's ridiculous. These companies honestly don't deserve a cent from people 🤦🏽‍♂️

"Dating At 28? I turned 28(M) and last I had dated was around 21 - 22 which was 2 months which ended bad and then I just bounced back to focus on my career around 2 years I focused on that and built it up, then I was thinking to date but then covid came and coz of negativity on going I had to deal with anxiety and also work was affected so my focus went to work and health and thats how just I turned 28.  
So, from last 5yrs I have been 0 social not met anyone coz usually I used to just chat with business and friends also online, not meeting in person.  
Now I am just working on getting the social life back but coz of my past anxiety in these 3 years that time it was on health anxiety coz of covid and news, but then it shifted to now from last 3 - 4 days on relationships and it just gave me tons of weird thoughts of like 28 is too late, a bit regret feeling on wasting last 5yrs, but actually when I talked with 1 friend who broke up he was like he regrets that relationship of wasting time and money lol.  
Right now coz of no social life my routine has been bad too like sleep in day wake up afternoon / evening, I guess that's the main cause of anxious feeling sometimes and these thoughts.

"How to move on after ex (22f) broke up with me (23m) after proposing to me and making me travel across the world to be with her I (23m) dated my now-ex girlfriend (22f) for 2 years, and we had a wonderful relationship in my eyes filled with love, partnership and we really cared for each other, our only weak point was communication, but we were working on it steadly and improvements were showing.

after a while together, I moved countries for her, leaving behind my friends and family. I had also found a job and started working hard, I came from poverty but managed to save 100k € to eventually buy a house for us. I honestly saw myself in the long term future having a life with her and she always motivated me to be better.

don't get me wrong, i was far from perfect, i'm not the tidiest guy around, and stress sometimes turned me into a grumpy moster, but i was working on improving my shit.

my communication improved a lot since the beginning of the relationship, as well as my ability to talk about my feelings, which I had never been able to do before and i was seeing really good improvement.

the first time she broke up with me was 6 months ago, after which she went wild on tinder while I fell into a deep depression and was the worse i've ever been before specially since i was left alone in a country i had no one ( this made a bit harder for me to take her back due to the pain she caused me but i ended up forgiving her ).

a couple weeks after the first breakup, she moved in with a friend of hers who had a crush on her and said she realized she had made a mistake and wanted to give us another chance.

i took her back and we were having an awesome time after getting back together, and I tried my best to fix the problems that caused her to leave, but it is stuff that takes time, and I again was honestly seeing a lot of improvements on my end.

within 2 months of us getting back together, she proposed to me and I accepted, we got engaged, i started working harder to build the future i saw with her.

two months after she proposed to me, she went to visit her parents in Singapore and invited me (almost begged) for me to come.

the trip was really not ideal, i knew it would be a bit stressful cause work was piling up, but I wanted to be there for her specially since it was something she valued (her past). i sacrificed my plans and work. but as soon as i got there it was totally different than what she said, it was tense, and we barely had any time together.

we only spent 7 days out of the 13 days I was there together, which was a bummer for me since she was begging me to be with her. Towards the end of the trip, she broke up with me, saying she wanted to move back with her parents (I assume she enjoyed being a child again instead of having responsibilities). (she mentioned she liked having stuff made for her such as her parents making her dentist appointments and stuff like that).

on top of that she blamed me for everything, not cleaning the house, working a lot, not listening to her and being toxic, and she said i wasnt worth it.

i need some help seeing if i'm really that horrible, i indeed got angry with her from time to time and we had some heated arguments in topics we didn't see eye to eye and could've done a better job cleaning the house but that was it and it was stuff i was working on.

i just got a 6 figures job offer with relocation to switzerland but I know I can't accept it, i don't want to move to another country and be lonely and even more depressed, I even had to quit the projects i'm currently working on.  


i completely hate myself right now and blame myself for everything wrong that has happened, i haven't been able to live lately and can't stop thinking about her, how do i just forget all of this and move on specially after all i wanted in the future was this woman and building a life with her.",JohnnyCampello,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15994ig/how_to_move_on_after_ex_22f_broke_up_with_me_23m/,1690293054.0,1.0

"As a man, what should I have learned from the Barbie movie? *spoilers* So I did Barbieheimer. Well I should say I did Oppenharbie, since I saw oppenheimer first. 

I went into barbie with an open mind. I knew it was going to be from a female perspective. I knew they were probably not going to portray men in a flattering way. I knew that I probably would not get the kind of catharsis I typically do. And it sort of fulfilled that. But I did enjoy it. The funny parts were funny, and I loved Ryan Gosling and Will Farrell especially. 

My own takeaway from this movie is that Greta Gerwig totally doesn't get what men want. To her, we can find fulfillment in masculine things like horses and sports. And we want women to be brainless, because we sort of are. In the real world, because we live in a patriarchy (and I'm not saying we aren't), society is set up for my success . And it sort of is. I do have a good career and I can feel safe in public spaces, so I will recognize that advantage. 

But the one thing I think I want is the love of a woman. And, in the movie, that is what Ken wanted, except his character arc ended with him realizing that he needed to be complete on his own. 

So like, with a genuine and open mind, *is this the lesson I should have learned from the film?* I'm asking because it is what women have told me for a very long time.

So...so far I have limited sexual experience; I've only had one girlfriend and we didn't go all the way because of her previous history of abuse; this was nearly a decade ago and haven't had any sort of intimacy with anyone since (also, had a painful childhood and teen years and healing from that as well as putting myself through Engineering school have been my priority).  
I've always known that my ideal and what feels most satisfying to me personally is having sex only with the person I'll marry (waiting till we're officially engaged or even till marriage); but for most of my life I've felt it's unrealistic and that persevering in that will mostly lead to frustration/resentment. I feel very alone in this and would love to discuss it with other people, especially if Jewish and/or gay (heterosexual and non-religious or people from other religions are also welcome).  
Also, I worry that women might discard me for my now intentional lack of experience or compare me to exes etc.  
Perhaps the most balanced option is having sex only in long-term relationships (waiting for at least a year before doing it etc).  
The purpose of this post is to find people that relate or in general discuss it to help me decide what I'll do in the future.

"Me (22M) feels happy but unsure after a date with female (20F) Today me 22M went on a date with 20F. We met on tinder and have been texting alot and talked once on phone for the past week. Today we had our first physical date which from my experience went really good. We had lunch and afterwards went to a park where we sat and talked, we clicked quickly and then talked about a little bit of everything even certain stuff that are more private.

On the date we held hands, walked around the city and kissed around 4x times. When the day was over and it got late we said goodbye and kissed one more time before she drove off. She seemed just as happy with the date as I was so I went home with what I thought was a good feeling (the whole date lasted 5 whole hours)

Problem: when I got home I sent her a snap and asked if she wanted to have a second date and she said yes!!! BUT... she then added that she was unsure of her feelings, at first I thought it was just normal since it was the first date after all and I answered that its fine with me if we take it slow but... the more I thought about it the more worried I became...

Between all of our discussions we had today I remember her quickly mention her ex (not a good sign I know but it was subtle and quick) apparently they had broken up around 6 months ago in December which is kind of long time to be single IMO so I doubt I am a rebound after that long time?? She also mentioned she had been having some short lived encounters with other guys during the last months that did not last, just as I had unfortunate encounters with other girls that did not click during the same time. 

So my question: is this a red flag? It was only the first date after all but I like this girl and I am not sure if I should invest more thoughts and feelings onto her if she can not (or do not want to) respond the same?

I could also be overreacting because she wanted a second date with me and I am pretty sure she enjoyed my company and I am still on her contact lists... I have decided to give her some space today and not write to her as much as we usually do but: if you were me and chose to keep trying to invest in her, how would you do it?

"When a woman says ""I'm not looking for anything right now because I just got out of long-term relationship"", is it true? Hi, just looking for some advice because I'm a little confused right now. I met this girl at a festival and we basically spent the whole night dancing and making out. We didn't go further because I had plans to take her on a date sometime later. 

However, I messaged her today and she said ""I'm not looking for anything right now because I just got out of long-term relationship"". I just wonder if she tries to put me down gently or is it actually true? I remember the ""Brad Pitt rule"" and I guess she would go on the date regardless of the situation if she really liked me? But then again, I was never in a long term relationship so I can't imagine how the breakup must feel like.

"Why do girls like a little belly on their man??? Not trying to brag here, but by many accounts I'm quite a fit, good-lookin' dude. However I'm not Olympic athlete level fit. I have a little bit of a belly and love-handles. I've always been a little self-conscious about it and I'm working on losing that last little bit of fat.

HOWEVER every girl I've ever been with, including my current gf, have all either indirectly or directly said they love my belly/love handles. They tell me I'm so hot even though I don't have those chizzled abs that models and famous actors do. Whenever I talk about wanting to lose weight and get rid of the belly/love handles they are always genuinely distressed and say things like ""nooo! I love your little belly!"" Or ""I don't want you to lose too much weight."" and etc.

I really want to understand this. How/why do girls find this attractive? What is it about a little bit of belly on a guy that girls find so attractive? And wouldn't any girl be happy to see their bf work on himself and get more and more fit? I have heard of the notion of the bf being super fit triggering self-confidence issues and such. I can understand that somewhat - Sometimes I look at my gf who is just so hot and it makes me wonder could someone so attractive really chose me? - But is there more to it?

Edit: This has been really informative and helpful. I think I might finally be able to feel more comfy in my own skin (or body as it were), finally being able to rest in the notion that there's more than one type of body that women find attractive. I guess I'm that ""husky"" or ""hardy"" kindof body that makes women feel safe and comfy. :)",mapleflavrd,351,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158hqr3/why_do_girls_like_a_little_belly_on_their_man/,1690221087.0,0.84

"A blossoming relationship seems to be on the brink (again) Just want to share this. Because I sense that I’m going to be dumped, again.

I (37m) have been seeing this wonderful (38F) for 6 weeks now. We get along great. I respect and admire her so much. From the beginning, we were both open about our circumstances. She was a mother of 2, literally just starting to date 5-years after her divorce. I am a single, childless professional, who is likely to move to another country in 18months.

The last 6 weeks have been great. We just went on a 3-day holiday together. At the end of the holiday, I think she’s become uneasy with the fact that I probably will move away. I cannot guarantee whether I will or I won’t, neither can I say if I’ll come back.

Since returning home. She’s been silent. 

This happened 6 months ago. Another woman I dated developed feelings for me. And instead of seeing where it goes, they dropped me because I can’t guarantee where I’ll be in (then 2 years).

I feel guilty of sorts that I am causing my current gf sadness. I just don’t know what else to do. All I want is to be present with her and make her happy. I hate to think that she’s currently deep-in-thought and in doubt.

I also feel sad for me. It’s like I can’t be with someone for now because I have long term plans.

I'm waiting for my (19f) boyfriend (18)to break up with me over some issues that i promised to fix but there's something I can't fix : i have and ex that I slept with (way before i met my boyfriend) and my bf won't get over it for a whole year we've been dating.
It makes him unhappy and I was begging and begging to the point where i feel like I'm just holding someone who wants to leave...
We we're unbelievable happy when we met, I was his hallway crush but i made a first move. Seeing him up close, he looked exactly what a man from little me's dream looked like, and he treated me like a queen.
Eventually things got into way and he has no energy for me as much, but he has for others and it hurt so much that i became anxiously attached.
Since i started asking for more time and after he promised to do so, he suddenly requested we see each other less often. 
It was not what i was used to ans it got me worried.
Now he told me he needs 3-4 days to decide if we'll continue to date or not and there's 3 hours left as I've been in pain waiting but every time i asked if he decided he said he doesn't know.

"Is he/this a red flag? I \[26f\] have a crush \[27m\] who I was thinking of asking out soon.

We play the same sports, are both involved in the same \*sport community, studied the same program at the same college, we work for the same company by coincidence, and overall we have a lot in common . \*I won't say what sport or college program I think it'll give me away just incase lol\*

However, at a recent \*sport\* competition, my friend pointed out that everytime we passed by him he was always hanging out with girls.

I follow him on IG and noticed that he's always liking posts of girls with a certain aesthetic. Pretty girly girls, asian influencers. (eg. SandyDianaBang, Helen Peng) I like following these girls too, but because I like the way they dress too and I wanna know what makeup they're using. But it's like he's the only guy to pop up on nearly ALL these girl's posts. A LOT.

The few thoughts that come up are like ""Wow. He's girl crazy."" ""He likes this type of girl huh?""

What do y'all think? Is it not a huge deal, or is he a ""Wear My Hug At?"" type of guy. Is he girl crazy cus he wants his pick of the best? To understand the female brain?

He's super popular in our \*sport community. Everyone loves him, and have said he's super sweet. I've chatted with him a few times too and yeah, he has golden retriever energy. But someone has said before that he seems to be girl crazy.

"Interested in someone asexual So sorry if this is all over the place but I tend to overthink things, but also want to keep it vague as it wouldn't surprise me if they're on reddit.
So as the title says I'm interested in someone that is asexual. They've consistently surprised me at every turn at how much we have in common, I think they're absolutely beautiful, and frankly they're an all around amazing person. I could sing their praises all day, but it may just be me being infatuated with them. I don't read people incredibly, or even mildly, well. Most people I've dated in the past have been VERY direct, like grabbing my junk and let's get it on, direct. Being asexual, they wouldn't do that. We've cuddled, and held hands, but it's not like they haven't shown that kinda affection to others around us, not quite to the degree they have with me, but it has me guessing, are they interested in me, or are they just that open with their friends?
I just want to date this person as of right now. My past experience says go for it they're interested, they probably want to jump your bones but are holding back because they're waiting on you to make a move. But again, they're asexual, so they don't get those... urges.
I need advice about what's the best way to talk about this with them, without risking the friendship we have going? Or are they just cuddly but not interested in me, so don't read too much into it(?)

"Expecting guys to pay on a first date and low effort men? (Rant) I feel that when guys do pay for the first and next few dates of the dating process, it shows me that he has interest in me and gives me the sign that he is willing to be a protective caretaker. Just based off of the family dynamic of my parents, my dad is the breadwinner and works to take care of my mom. My mom has been a stay-at-home mom and rarely works--to be honest, she probably has worked a total of about 2-4 years her whole life. I guess my mom has always raised me to believe that when a guy is willing to pay for things, especially in the beginning, it shows that he is capable of taking care of you and is a reliable man. However, I know that this is a very traditional view and I do think this way of thinking has become an expectation when I go on dates. Don't get me wrong, probably 99% of the guys where I have gone out on dates with will pay for the first date...but I think by them doing that it has made me see it as an expectation and expect him to pay for the next, next, and ongoing dates. I just don't know what I can do to remove this ingrained belief that I have known based on my parent's way of dating. And how should I suggest meeting guys then on a first date where we don't have to spend so much? Also, I noticed that when I initiate guys to meet up for the first time and suggest meeting up again, that is when they get all low effort and put no energy into the connection. I have found some guys on dating apps would just message me for 3-4 weeks and no sign of asking to meet-up; so I was just assuming they were shy so then I ask to meetup and then they either they me they are busy or meetup but then also slow down and not let me know when to meetup again. Online dating is just so frustrating and boring...I feel like I end up wasting so much time messaging and talking with guys who put zero effort in actually meeting up.

"This girl got cheated on and then we started talking and things moved close to a relationship and then she said she wasn’t ready So my friend set me up with this girl she worked with who had got cheated on about a month prior, things were going really well for about 2 weeks. I had noticed things about how she talked that I noticed that made it seem like she wasn’t quite ready for something yet(like saying sorry for not hanging out or would change subjects when I talked about her being pretty). So she and my friend kinda talked about it then she and I talked about and she gave the all clear that she was ready about a week ago. Then yesterday I asked her to go to dinner(we had gone on multiple dates with friends around and it was no big deal) and she got a little weird about it so I asked her about how her ex treated her and he was manipulative and wouldn’t let her do stuff which is why she always said sorry for not hanging out. Well we started talking about her past and one thing lead to the other and she said she wasn’t ready and then we both agreed to be friends. What I’m wondering is how long does it take for someone to get over someone cheating on them? I really like this girl and we both agreed that we are into each other and we see us going somewhere(that was before this conversation for context).

"I feel like he’s taking too long to make it official I (26 F) have been dating this guy (46 M) for almost 8 weeks now. We’ve seen each other every week since and the last 3 weekends, I’ve spend consecutive nights over his house.

We go on dates all the time, he’s met my parents, and we communicate almost every day. I feel like his girlfriend, but we haven’t made it official nor do we even talk about a relationship/future together.

Neither of us is seeing anyone else and I brought up the, “What are we?” conversation, although we were interrupted by something important and said we’d resume it later. He says that he sees it going in the relationship direction, but I’m a little frustrated that although he’s consistent and treats it like a relationship, he hasn’t taken the initiative to commit.  

I don’t like the idea of having to be the one to push that conversation. A part of me feels as though I’m wasting my time because most men (in my experience) express what they want without me prompting it and want to lock things down.

"Can someone help me? For context a girl asked me to exchange numbers with her sister. At the time I didn’t know how she looked like but I still went with it. We ended up talking and eventually calling frequently. She’s a good person with no major red flags. We connect on a surface level and have some similar hobbies. Personality wise we have some chemistry. The issue is that I don’t find her physically attractive. She’s not bad looking just not my type. Through the calls that we’ve had she said that she’s interested in me and wants to be more than just friends. I told her that I want to see where my feelings are. I want to take things slow and see how things develop. Because I didn’t want to continue to talk to her without making it clear that I’m just trying to get to know her. If I haven’t told her it would seem like I’m leading her on. So boom line drawn, my intentions are out on the table. But the more I text her and call her, the more I realize that she is falling deeper for me. And the more I realize that she’s just a friend. 

I’ve asked her on a hangout/date to see how she is in person. To be one on one is a more personal space that I want to use to get to know her better. But at the same time I feel she thinks I’m progressing from talking to dates now. When I’m just trying to see if I really like her or not.

"Should i talk to this guy again after he sent me some distressing photos? I hooked up with him after we met through tinder a few months ago. The experience was pretty bad, for a number of reasons, but after that we kept talking because we had some things in common and i overall enjoyed his company (we only saw each other in person once, after that i went overseas). He did like me a lot and even wanted to date but i told him no. I'll mention that he has a ""traditional"" mindset and tends to agree with stuff that Andrew Tate says, but nothing crazy.  
  
Why we fought: one day he was telling me that i need someone like him to protect me, and i told him protect me from what? Then he sent me some stickers on whatsapp, it was some pretty fucked up stuff that i don't want to explain or detail. He told me before that his friends are together in a groupchat where they send each other ""messed up stuff"", but that's it's not necessarily him who engages in that. Seeing that upset me a lot and we stopped talking. He said sorry and when i didnt answer, he blocked me.  
  
Then today he apparently unblocked me and DMed me asking how i am. Deep down i knew i should have just ignored him but i ended up answering him. Now he wants to hang out again...  
  
I'll be honest and say that i am someone that likes getting attention or approval from others, and i find it hard to let go of people even if they haven't been good to me. In this case i just miss having someone to talk to all the time, and i'll also say that it's a general ego boost since i know he likes me.

"Should I confront the guy I’m dating why he hasn’t texted me in week? I (24F) started seeing this guy (25M) back in March. There have been a few ups and downs and we live about 4 hours apart. The TLDR is in the last paragraph. The 4th paragraph contains necessary backstory I recommend you read. 

We stopped talking for two weeks late April (I blocked him) because I got mad at him for being angry that his ex/mother of his child hooked up with his friend. I ended up forgiving him.

We saw each other in person in June. He came up the first time to see his family and made time to see me. The second time I visited him and I almost broke it off because he fell asleep on me after we hooked up. I ended up spending the afternoon with his family but we made up.

(Necessary backstory) 
We were supposed see each other 2 weeks ago but a family member he lives with got sick. He hasn’t came up to see me because he said he doesn’t have money right now. He recently just switched jobs. 

Ever since he canceled on me I haven’t heard from him in a week. I called him Sunday night it went to voicemail. I texted Monday morning to see if he was doing well. He struggles with depression on top of having adhd. He recently got on medication for his depression and starting seeing therapy. 

Another important thing to note is earlier this year I told him I was messing around with a friend. Days before I was set to come out, I told him the truth that it was actually my coworker not a friend. I told  him I lied about it because I was embarrassed. I clarified things between us are over and I don’t want to be with him. He’s also gotten cheated on the past.  

I know it was wrong to hide that and I apologized. 

Another important thing to note we defined early on we wanted a serious relationship. When I admitted the truth about my coworker we also discussed this again and asked if we’re heading towards a relationship. 

My question is, should I call/text him to see why he hasn’t contacted me? I want to text him something like “hey I haven’t heard from you in a week are we still good? I’m assuming we’re done because I haven’t heard from you in a week. If so next time do the right thing and at least send a text ending things.” 

TLDR: the longish distance guy I’m seeing canceled on me coming out two weeks ago. I haven’t heard from him since he canceled on me. I tired reaching out Sunday night and my call went to voicemail and texted the next day day no response. I want to text him to ask why he hasn’t reached out and if things are done between us.

"Past experiences TW; brief mentions of abuse. Hey there.

I'm beginning to get back out there in the dating world, after my last relationship ended primarily due to an unwillingness to communicate, him being emotionally incestious with his family, and my PMDD definitely played a part I think. 

I also suspect there was some sexual/another kind of infidelity on his side, but it was never confirmed. The signs were there, and I also think that maybe also just had some massive issues dealing with serious past trauma, especially as he just didn't want to communicate, and would rather shut down, and not put any effort in.

He also KNEW my serious past trauma history (DV, and being the victim of multiple types of abuse &amp; assault) when he decided to betray me by using intimacy, to gauge if he felt anything for me anymore, which was essentially the #1 biggest hardest boundary I drew and communicated to him that wasn't to be crossed &amp; was an automatic relationship game over move if it were to happen, when the relationship started.

Now that I am getting back out there and meeting new people romantically &amp; for relationships, I am so scared of mistaking something for loveb---ing, for example, because it's what I've gotten in the past. Like if a guy is just affectionate by nature (eg. golden retriever puppy in human form), I'm nervous I'll mistake it for loveb---ing, and heck things up when they're perfectly good, even after all my relationship trauma therapy, and continuous therapy that I'm going through, &amp; getting.

For example, am talking to a new guy, and we just click, and I'm being wary and careful, while not self-sabotaging. He's flirting, but I think also because I'm on the spectrum, my mind is like 'wtf is this sorcery, and how do I deal with it?!'. I don't know how to respond.

I've dealt with my trauma enough to know that I'm safe to be interpersonally intimate at least with someone again, because I have the presence of mind to try and not let my past traumas actively affect my present relationships (friends, romantic, platonic &amp; everything in between), and to work on the problem behaviours when they come up.

**How do y'all tell the difference between someone just being affectionate (which I'm not super used to, and with my mind doing it's job and trying to keep me safe, it jumps to the worst case scenario immediately), and love-b***ing?**

"And now she wants to be friends So long story short my girlfriend (28F) and I (39M) split properly last week. This was after she split with me but then wanted to get back together on a casual basis. I was happy with that but she kept cancelling dates and coming up with excuses why she couldn’t see me. I said I couldn’t do causal that involved only seeing each other for 30 mins every two weeks as I needed more connection. I felt I should be pursuing something else which wasn’t possible for me if we were involved, so we mutually called it off. Ultimately we’re not compatible and there’s no future in that relationship.

I didn’t hear from her in 5 days and wasn’t expecting her to reach out. I felt like it was all done and dusted and I’ve been trying to move on with my life. The weeks and events before the breakup caused me a lot of worry and anxiety, I was glad it was all over tbh and was feeling good about myself again. She text tonight saying she wants to be friends but without blurring the lines of that friendship. We do have to take a class together next year so for the case of civility I’d be happy to be friends, however, not just yet.

I’m not sure how to respond to the text yet. I feel I want to do no contact for bit before I can say if we can be friends or not. Also I want to focus on me and move forward with my life. I feel that’s going to be difficult if she’s texting as ‘a friend’ and stirring up memories or if theirs ulterior motives. I’m too old to be playing these kind of games.

"Bf says he ""earned"" a bj and ""needs"" it, but doesn't respect my disgust towards it. **thanks for all the advice** I sat down with him and talked for hours, even continued the conversation to days. It really went amazing and he seemed understanding until he hit me with ""i liked you better when you were 17 and more open"". Immediately broke up with him and found out from his family he's seeing someone new already who is 17 which made them kick him out. I have no further update. I just know they haven't seen him since and i changed the locks on my home and blocked him.
---
My bf (23) and i (21) have been dating for 4 years. In those 4 years he's done ALOT for me and had to deal with my mental health issues. Everytime he did something (small like buy me candy or big like gift me earrings), he ALWAYS says ""i deserve head"" or ""i really earned head"". I came forward and explained my disgust towards giving head and he just hits me with ""it's clean. I haven't peed. I can shower."" or whatever.
Sometimes went so far and said ""but i give u head? how's that fair?"" which i told him, he does because he wants it. Not because i asked/begged for it. I'm at the point where i refuse to let him give me head because he's gonna ask for himself afterwards.
My opinion isn't gonna change on it. It's gross to me and what's worse is, that his ""thing"" smells really f-ing disgusting all the time+he's a cigarette smoker. Just imagine the bad diet.
This begging has turned me off so much that there's no sexual activities going on at all since a few months, which makes him even more aggressive and triggered. He mentioned once that if this isn't gonna change, he can't continue this relationship because he ""needs"" it in his life.
Sometimes he just shoves ""it"" in my face and like i mentioned, it stinks. Happened before in my sleep as well. I don't know what to do anymore. I gotta admit, i myself have no real interest in touching it. Yes, I'm 100% straight. Just no high sex drive and more of a cuddly person.
The relationship overall is amazing. I truly think he's my soulmate and apart from this issue, we match with everything. No serious fights, no disrespect...he cheated 3 times over his phone, but i forgave him, because it was pretty early into the relationship.

"Does being a virgin mean you dont know how to talk to women? A friend of mine who i do not consider a close friend because we just started hanging out this year wanted to go clubbing with me or going to bars. I'm 26 he's about 23 and there's definitely a maturity gap between us. We both agreed that we would be wingmen for each other going out. I've had no sexual experience in my life haven't even kissed a woman. I kind of regret telling him my lack of experience but I thought that if he's a true friend that he'd at least be supportive. 

We decided on going out to a part of town that we 
agreed upon and I told him I'd prefer a low-key place because I'm not really a big extrovert and I'd prefer to talk to people one-on-one or have a more low-key setting like at a speakeasy or some of the lower key type bars in town. He put a lot of pressure on losing my V Card and even went to the extent of saying that I don't know how to talk to women because I am a virgin as if it's some fact. I've explained that I've improved my social skills and that I've been practicing a lot of flirting with women. I personally don't think I don't know how to talk to women but I just haven't had good opportunities to have sexual encounters in my life at this point. I am a bit shy and sometimes I do put myself in positions where I miss opportunities to at least get numbers or express my interest in somebody. While I think I might not have as much experience as other guys obviously,I do think that I shouldn't be putting myself down and think that i can't because if you actually believe that you can't talk to women it's probably going to not go so well. 

I tried to debate with him that manifesting a sexual encounter with a woman is not exactly the same thing as talking to a woman. Obviously trying to gain attraction and respect the other person's boundaries and what they're comfortable with is the first step before trying to create a sexual encounter. I think this guy is more socially awkward than me though at times so I don't really know if he has a place to be arguing a certain point when I don't even know his own sexual experience. Also I think the point of going out is to have a good time , not to try to put pressure on trying to have a sexual encounter. If it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't.

"Is Promiscuity the new normal? How to accept this reality? Edit: Common response is not to judge the book by the cover. I wonder how to judge then? What would signal that woman is actually serious about long term relationship? How to spot a red flag?

Hello folks,
 
I am not trying to be picky on OLD but most women who I find remotely attractive are so sexually provocative in their profiles. I can't swipe right on them. Their profile suggests seeking long term but their pics says otherwise. 

I can't imagine someone in their early 30s would make profile like these if they are seeking a committed relationship. If I have to bet my money they are having casual fun all along but won't mind to settle if someone nice comes their way. 

I am insecure on meeting such women. I don't think I will be able to look past their promiscuous past. I will always think they are settling for me because I was the only loser they could find for commitment. 

Am I stupid for having these thoughts and judging women based on their pics without actually meeting. I am rusty and things might have changed in the past few years. (Out of dating scene for 6 years)

My follow up question would be if a promiscuous woman can change in long term relationship? I wonder if any normal guy tried dating a promiscuous woman.

I just need time to deal with this fact that’s all!!! I love him unconditionally!



I’m madly in love with my current boyfriend just to state that. 
The story is that, we often joke about having sex in public where everyone can see us, we both know that wont happen in the middle of the day in crowded place, so it was fine until he asked me if I had ever had public sex. I was in shock bc he asked me that but I guess it’s fine, so i told him I didn’t (which is true), anyways he was like “noo jokeeess, really??”, and I was quite surprised. Firstly, I don’t have much experience with men in general, not to talk about some adventurous activities like that, so i asked him (which I deeply regret) did he had it with some of his exs, and he told me he had it in H&amp;M and in the park. I was stunned. My jaw literally dropped. I was too shocked to talk. 
Just to state, i have nothing against public sex and people who like that kind of stuff, BUT, from my angle, that kind of thing should be done with someone you are in a long relationship (like 3-4 or 5 yrs or more) or with someone you firmly know you gonna stay with. That’s just how i see things. His longest relationship is with me (3 months now). From what he told me, all his relationships would fall apart after a week or 2 (in the best case) because he was neither serious about them, neither were they. 
So the problem now is, after he told me that, when i look in his eyes, all I see is him, with someone else, in H&amp;M cabin. Last night, and tonight, I can’t fall asleep without having sex scene in my head where he is with some other girl in H&amp;M. 
Now, people will tell me to talk about this with him, but to be completely honest, I can’t bare to listen any more about his past experiences with any of his ex girlfriends. I told him that today that I don’t want to know anymore more about them and if he wants to tell me something about them like a funny story or whatever, to think twice before telling me and if he thinks it’s the best, just to lie to me. I was, and I am crying myself to sleep.

It’s made very clear that I’m not invited when this happens. They were friends before he met me and before sleeping together so I think asking him to choose between us is very muddled and weird for me.

"How to handle this situation? So I (M25) got to know this girl (F20) from a birthday party a month ago and we talked for a bit (I assume she wanted me to ask her out but I only got the idea in hindsight). She left early but followed me on instagram the next day. I hit her up and asked her out to which she said „yes very much“. 

Not going into many details here. The first date was nice, I brought a blanket and something to eat and we had a good time. We held hands and I kissed her on her forehead but she didn’t want to make out. No problem for me. The next day she told me how beautiful she thought it was and how she wants to see me again. So for the date I visit her town, we went to the riverside, she baked some cake and shit and it was nice again. After that I noticed that I had missed my train (she lives right next to the station), so I suggest we go wait at her’s to which she agreed. We listened to lots of music we both happen to like and after an hour I leave. We didn’t kiss still and I don’t need to rush things. She has exams going and shit and I have stuff to do, so we didn’t meet last week but we wanted to meet today. Yesterday though she texts me that she has some issues with her endometriosis and that we can’t meet today but she’s already looking forward to next time. I would be in her town today anyway, so I decide to look up some things that might help with her issues, buy that shit and bring it to her together with a card. She opens the door and she was surprised. She said it was cute and she felt speechless and whatever. I leave because I got shit to do and after an hour she texts me again to thank me but also talk to me. 

I call her. She explains how she thought what I did was cute and how nobody ever did something like that for her BUT she doesn’t see anything beyond friendship and doesn’t want to lead me on and that she feels bad to do it over the phone and so on. I tell her it’s ok and that I saw more than that and that I think it would be better if we stopped talking and wished her the best, she accepted. 

Obviously I felt like I had no other choice but I feel crushed. I don’t know where it all went wrong.

"Mourning the end of a FWB My FWB and I have called it quits. I feel really sad about its not because I wanted to date them or liked them romantically but because we actually genuinely became good friends and were constantly talking. We occasionally hang out with the same friend group too. It was going to happen eventually because I will be moving to another city.

I think he was catching feelings and he is also a few years younger than me so I am trying to value his space too. I feel like he is trying to play it off casually which makes me wonder either if he is even sad too (like I thought he would be) and needs space or if he really just doesn’t care to be my friend/about me like I thought he did.

Anyway, how do you guys get over this feeling? Lol. Again it feels like mourning the loss of a friendship, it’s not that I fell in love. We were both also very clear from the start even though I do think he caught feelings.

TL;DR- how do you get over the end of a FWB that you actually developed a good friendship with and now there’s distance.",yeezymoneybaby,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1599neg/mourning_the_end_of_a_fwb/,1690294271.0,1.0
"Is a FWB possible? Kinda shameless post here. girl 21f and me 21m went on a date together, turns out we liked each other and we had a great physical connection. we only made out tho. She tells me she wants a casual relationship and i say no, later i change my mind and we're okay for a few days. Then, she calls it off.

i still fancy her, only physically tho. we have good chemistry as friends only. She seemed interested in me because she asked me out, made the first moves and everything. We chatted normally for a few days after everything but i ghosted her because i realised my intentions were to get back with her and not to stay as friends. its been 10 days since i ghosted her

i have never done a fwb before, and i just want some intimacy during the summer.

"Help!! I can’t get over a situationship :( Uh! I need to get this off my chest. I dated somebody briefly a couple of months ago ..went on just a few dates but I became attached too soon. We had a lot of similar interests, wanted the same kind of things from life, the chemistry was great between us ..fireworks! But it was not just the chemistry, there was something about this guy, that felt very familiar and his company was comforting in many ways.. never felt that way about anyone before. He excited me, challenged me but at the same time made me feel safe and comfortable. Sometimes I think it was all in my head but in his company I felt radiant and happy. The problem was he gave me a lot of mixed signals … would go days without communicating, (something that my ex did too) but when we were together it all seemed great. He had a lot of past hurt and baggage that I felt he carried along … and he seemed beaten up from the online dating scene which may have been one of the causes why he acted the way he did. I’m not very vocal of my feelings or in the way I show up so maybe he didn’t get a good read on me ..idk .. but the last straw for me was when we tried sleeping together at his place on our last date (which didn’t happen) and he asked me to leave despite telling me it would be a good idea to stay over! And that’s it … I let him go. And he didn’t tried reaching to me either … just shared some heartbreak related quote on his social media a couple of days later. Since that day, I have not been able to let go of him … I keep thinking about him and not a single day has passed without thinking of him. This feeling is so treacherous I hate it. I want to move on but at the same time the idea that I’ll find that sort of connection ever again is hard to take in as I’ve never felt that way ever!

"My Second Date - About my Dating Experience on a Herpes Dating Site Navigating the dating scene with herpes is a challenge in it’s own right. Discrimination, stigma, and fear often overshadow the potential joys of a blossoming romance. That’s why hesitantly yet hopefully, I turned to a specialized venue - a herpes dating site. What unfolded next was to be my unique, unanticipated second date.  
  
The digital cupid struck its arrow, pairing me with a dare-devilish student, hailing from one of the local colleges. Her pictures portrayed a fiery femme fatale - the kind of woman who would never fade into a crowd: a bold and spicy six-foot-tall seductress. Our digital encounters soon translated into a physical meeting, a coffee date by her campus.  
  
We rendezvoused at a quaint cafe near her college, the excitement in the air almost palpitable. The casual catch-up started with discussions about how our lives evolved post our herpes diagnoses. Such deeply personal conversations acted as the much-needed ice-breaker, paving the path for a trust-filled bond with openness at its core.  
  
Subsequently, the conversation took an unexpected turn. We plunged into an intimate discussion around our favorite sexual positions. It was an uncensored, liberating dialogue, free from any judgement or hesitation.  
  
As daylight faded, we decided to extend our date into the evening. A local restaurant was our choice for a delicious dinner, full of laughs, shared secrets, and mutual understanding. The culmination of our date took place at a hotel, an oasis of discretion and intimacy where we felt comfortable exploring our desires.  
  
From the moment we crossed the threshold of the hotel room, our anticipation escalated. We couldn’t resist the magnetic pull between us any longer. An intense and long-lasting lovemaking session took up most of the night, immersing us in a blissful, exhaustive trance.",N111ko_for_dating,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159qek4/my_second_date_about_my_dating_experience_on_a/,1690331543.0,0.43

I want to bring up to him that it makes me uncomfortable that he’s does that especially since we’re having .. relations.

"Dating is hard. Especially when older. Even more so in the Midwest. I'm a guy in my early/mid thirties and man, dating was never easy, but it feels like it just gets more difficult. I've seen some posts here kin to what I'm talking about. 

I don't really ""connect"" with people that often. I can find people attractive. I've been found attractive. People have asked me on dates and I've had to be on both sides of a rejection. I don't know what it is. I guess I'm emotionally picky? Physicality isn't a huge motivator or detractor. Attraction is important, yeah. But I want someone I can really just ""be"" with. I don't just want empty sex. A fwb would be good, I guess. But even that can't just be only physical stuff or I'd just end up feeling gross.

I look at the dating market and it's mostly people who are into a lot of drugs. Or have several kids. I don't have any of my own. I don't blame people who do, but it's a big thing to jump into when you're not a parent already.  

People tell me I'm just going to have to date someone younger than me, but looking back at my ex... it wasn't healthy. I loved her really deeply and it just ended up causing me to start acting like I did in my early twenties with all those issues I dealt with. We argued often. We just weren't good for one another. When I think about being in another relationship my blood goes cold. I don't want to hurt or hurt someone else. 

Of course a lot of this stuff could apply to anyone, but in the US Midwest, dipping into the South, even.. well, most people pair off between 18-22 here and it's just like... what do I even do at my age? Should I just give up that idea of companionship? I'm okay alone and I don't need anyone, but I want the same connections most anyone does. I wonder if it would be easier to just close that door.

"Not sure how to handle this situation Met this girl on a dating site and we matched. We actually studied together during uni and I had this huge crush on her during the start of uni. 

We spoke a couple of times and she seemed really nice but by the time I could pluck up the courage to ask her out she was already dating a senior . Fast forward to about 6 years later and we matched on a dating site. She starts to text me and doesn't remember me at all. So I go along with it and pretend to not know her as well and we stumble upon the fact that we studied together. 

Here's the catch , she is friends with a few people that I know and I'm sure she knows who I am because we share a few mutual connects as well and someone has spoken to her about me  recently. 

Conversation goes on pretty decently. We text about normal things such as work. I'm a bit hesitant to flirt as I normally do on dating apps while texting because I'm confused if she knows me or not ...but still we text back and forth for around an hour. 

The next day she starts to ignore me and after a few days unmatched me on the platform. I am genuinely confused as this has never happened before. 

It's been a few months now and I've gone on dates with other girls but I've seen her on the dating site a few times. 

I'm really curious as to why she texteded me for a whole hour and then ignored me for a few days and later unmatched. I really do feel like reaching out and asking her why she did what she did because I keep formulating reasons in my head.

"I (37M) went to South America and saw J (31F), but she didn’t post anything about us on her socials while I was there. I went to South America for two weeks in early July and got back a few days ago. I went to Antigua for a week for Spanish classes and went to Bogota for a week to meet up with J. I met her about 3 months ago dancing in DC. 

Antigua was great and Bogota was amazing.  J was an awesome tour guide. Things seemed to go well. I think she thought light kissing and hand holding was going too fast though. I did get a few serious kisses in but no sex. She’s a virgin. Cool. Nbd. I paid for everything because I didn’t want my tour guide to pay for my trip and because my US dollars spent a lot better. She’s not nearly as well off as me as a Colombian national. 

She’s been all about getting to know each other “slowly” and building a relationship instead of just one where we hook up this summer and go on our merry way. No worries. I’m looking for something more than that too. We’ve texted just about every day since we met. She was asking me how my days were and generally showing a genuine interest in how I was doing.

While I was there she insisted we take a ton of photos. Cool. I was totally down with that. Pictures of us. The things we did. When we had dinner on my last day she was trying food off my plate as soon as it hit the table. But she never posted any pictures of us on her insta while I was there and hasn’t really reached out since I’ve been back. 

She also posted a video of the belly dancer that was at the restaurant the night we went out. Short video. It got a few likes. I made a comment about how “i hear that place is nice!”, nothing major, but she deleted it. 😂 

It seems odd we hit it off so well and have been in such constant contact but to not have her post anything about me on her insta. To be honest it’s way too far and the distance is a huge deal breaker for both of us.

"11 Years My (29m) partner 29(F) just left our 11 year relationship out of the blue. She blind sided me by having all of her stuff moved out of the house while I went away for the day for a major back surgery. 

We were almost perfect. We shared all the same interests, values and hobbies but we were also able to keep ourselves separate enough to remain our own people. I loved everything about her and did everything I could to support her through college. Flash forward to just a month ago a mutual friend has a mental breakdown, almost full on ego death. She is there supporting him and she also experienced a profound revelation of her neurodivergent behaviors. They start hanging a lot more, he asks if it is okay if they hang out alone more and have more space because she reacts strongly to my presence. Sure, I want her to get better and learn the live again. 

They spend all night and day talking, playing video games and spending time together wallowing in their shared funks.  We went from doing just about anything together as a group (other friend is online) to she only really wants to hang out with him. She spends about 20 hours a day at her pc, the rest she sleeps or goes out with her irl girlfriends. 

Five days ago she dumped me out of the blue, all of our mutual friends except our IRL friends who know us well and one online friend who also thought something was fishy. She took everything, she didn't leave a note, she won't talk to me. All I have heard is that she is trying to destroy my name amongst our friends.

"divorcé dater After getting out of an extremely toxic relationship, I have recently started dating an amazing man who happens to be going through a divorce. Everything is great; the sex, the emotional intimacy and all of our future goals align. He’s basically the male version of me.   
But the problem lies with his crazy ex wife. He recently spoke to her about separating finances and finalizing the divorce. During the same conversation, she shared that she is thinking about quitting her job and would like to get on his health insurance while they are still married. After suggesting other options, he reluctantly agreed to putting her under his insurance plan. I don’t know what her deal is but I can’t help but wonder if she’s doing this in an attempt to sabotage his new relationship with me. She does things like this all the time and it makes me feel insignificant in the relationship. Almost like I have to compete for his love. I spoke to him about this before and he simply asked that I “work with him”? I really do love him and don’t want to lose him. But do I have a right to speak up about how their actions make me feel or should I stay quiet and let them work it out?

"Not sure if he's into me... Hello,

I (m/31) recently ended a relationship a couple months back. I felt I was ready to head back into the dating world, or at least look around for potential options. As I headed out on a two-week vacation to Europe, I received a like from this guy on Hinge (m/27). We started texting while I was in Paris and it turned into a facetime call. It would be around 3 a.m. for me to start this call since that would be around the time he'd get off of work Pacific Time. The chat went so well, six hours flew by. As I continued my trek around Europe, I would fit in a couple hours of sleeping just so I can wake in time to FaceTime him again for two weeks straight. 

We planned a date the day after I arrived back in town despite potential jet lag. Even the night before, we hopped on a FaceTime call that lasted four hours. By this point, it's pretty obvious he's into me and I'm into him. Not everyone would FaceTime someone for hours every day and not be into them, right? 

I meet up with him for our date and I felt the date went...okay? It seemed like he wasn't interested in me anymore. He'd check his phone, not return any compliments or flirts from me. We went to see Barbie in theaters and his body language had him crossing his arms the whole time, I fee like he didn't want me to put my arm around him or cuddle with him. 

At the end of the night, I gave him a couple of souvenirs I had picked up overseas. He collects shotglasses so I picked one up from all the countries I visited when I was FaceTiming him for those two weeks. He seemed very happy with them (he said his love language was gifts), and he gave me a hug and went home. 

During the date, we had discussed on going to another date this Thursday, but he texted me saying that he doesn't want to do it anymore because of money issues/busy schedule. I'm not sure if he's into me anymore. We never had any physical touching such as kissing during the date, and I'm not sure if I did something wrong. I didn't want to force something that he didn't want to do and I'm just at a complete loss. 

Do I bring up my feelings to him? What should I do next?",_Copper_,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159fo6c/not_sure_if_hes_into_me/,1690307559.0,1.0

"28F here. 6 relationships. Wondering if that’s a lot and if I’m doing something wrong? I’ve recently realized as I’ve gotten into my late 20s that I’ve had quite a busy love life, but with no luck in finding that one that I’m sure about. It’s my biggest dream in life to have an amazing fulfilling marriage and have that big happy family. So while I have been focusing on my education and career the past 10 years, I also have always remained open to meeting and dating. I have been in 3 long term relationships (1-2 yrs) and 3 short ones (6 months or less). I’ve also been in and out of the dating apps in the past and have been on a lot of first and second dates. However, I only met one of the short term boyfriends online, the rest were out in the world (class, mutual friends, mutual activities). 

I’ve been having the feeling lately that this 6 relationships might be a lot of relationships and I’m starting to wonder what’s going on. All my LT relationships were amazing in their own way, lot of great memories and I cherish each of them, but there always ended up being these big red flags or incompatibilities that I just can’t get past and it ends in a sad and traumatic breakup. Sometimes he would be feeling the same way, sometimes not. 

I’m paranoid that it’s just going to get harder and harder as I have more experiences. Like I’ll have too much to compare too. I’m also worried about future potential partners thinking that I’ve had too many boyfriends and being turned off by that.

I feel like most people get lucky and find their spouse after like the 2nd or 3rd LT relationship. I know a lot of people also tend to date for longer, whereas I’ve always been the person to know pretty early on if the relationship fulfills me or not. To also put it into perspective, I’m from the south, semi-rural, but I’ve moved around. I find both urban and rural settings to yield similar results.

TL;DR: Looking for insight from others who took a while to find their spouse. Is 6 relationships a lot for a 28 year old? Could that be a turn off? Could I be approaching dating in a way that isn’t working?",myrrhh,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159fkhy/28f_here_6_relationships_wondering_if_thats_a_lot/,1690307341.0,1.0
"Ask someone out after not hearing from them for over a month? Back in June I met someone at a conference. 

Texting went well at first. Though she said she said she’s not good at texting. Eventually I wouldn’t hear back for 48 hours. 

We went out for coffee about a week later. I suggested a second date to a museum and she sounded genuinely excited about it. 

I suggested a couple of days and I didn’t hear back until 3 or 4 days later. That was on one of the days I suggested going out. She said she was away that weekend and asked when I was free. I said have a great trip and reach out when you’re back so we can figure out a day. I never heard back. 

Normally, I would say this is over and she obviously wasn’t that interested. However, I was thinking of reaching out just because and instead of suggesting the museum or something like that, just keep it simple and ask if she wants to get a drink. 

I’m not sure how to open that conversation or even if I should.

"Do I need to step up as a “man” and help my GF with car insurance? Do I need to “step up as a man” (M21) or am I being mistreated by my GF? (F21) I have been with my GF for 5 years. We broke up last year and we got back together after 4 months. My life was hectic and so was hers and so we formed a strong bond with one another. Over the years there has been trial and tribulations. Her mom had a mid life crisis and went crazy. when she turned 18 she kicked her out of the house and divorced her husband. Which left my gf living with me.

Her and my mom didn’t get along so she moved out with her best friend (she was living rent free with us and choose to pay rent with her friend)  eventually she broke up with me because of how it was effecting me emotionally. Fast forward months and here we are, her friend is moving which means she needs another place to live. On top of that she got a DUI and her insurance is now 600$ a month. She works one job and for some reason won’t get another, she claims mentally she is drained. The issue started 3 days ago when she was crying. I asked her what was wrong and a whole can of worms was unleashed 


She wants me to put her on my moms insurance . with her as a secondary . And then said her step father said it was my turn as a man to step up and help her out. She then said she dosent understand how I could know what’s she’s going through and “watch her suffer” and that if I can’t do the insurance asked if I could help expunge her Record. I said this was a lot and that I needed time to think. She then called me selfish and talked about how I have never helped her… and that I have a few days to decide “what’s important “ she said I was also selfish for not agreeing to an apartment that I would pay more then her for “since my income is higher” She said so many couples do this and that I’m selfish for not wanting to do it for her. I then told her that I’m 21 and shouldn’t have to be responsible for her situation.  She then told me to let her know so she could find a man that will help her if I won’t. 

That same night she apologized and said she said a lot of things that she didn’t mean. And that she loves me and is just going through a very difficult time. I love her but don’t know how to handle this, she crossed a boundary however I love her and don’t want to kick her when she’s down:/ 


Thank you if you have read this far. It’s breaking my heart but I have no clue what to do in this situation. I’m nervous that if I help her again it might bite me in the ass like when I moved her into my house. And advise is appreciated.

"Signs that your ex still miss you ? What are the chances of getting back tgt Context:

We broke up around 5 mths ago and it was because of my situation. I am divorced with a kid and we always quarrel because of priorities for the kid vs hers. She can’t comprehend why I need to be there for the kid during special occasions such as dance or educational award ceremonies or birthday. She felt that it’s unfair because she treat me as a priority in her life but I didn’t manage to treat her as the main priority. 

I explained that the kid is a innocent party in broken marriage and I need to fulfill my duties as a father. Things eventually didn’t work out for both of us. During this turmoil period, her ex before me contacted her. 

After the break up, she get back together with her ex and they seem to travel overseas tgt. Somehow, I felt that she’s missing the attachment and her ex just happen to be there or she making of this opportunity to show me that she moved on. 

She continue to follow my instagram stories but disallow me to follow hers. I feel that because she doesn’t want to let me see her pic with her ex and trigger me to move on as quickly as her.

She did contacted me 1 mth ago to share with me her qualms and she hate me for treating her that way for a short moment and then went radio silence again

"After failed relationships, losses of loved ones, and my most recent breakup earlier this year, lead to a lot of self reflection- I have abandonment issues I’m not really venting but here to give my own opinions on if you are dipping your toe back into the dating pool after a breakup.

Are you okay? Did you reflect enough on your actions and the actions of your former partner? Are you in a healthy place to start dating again? If you still talk about your ex all the time, probably not.

Time is our most valuable asset. We can never make more of it. Why waste your time on a date if you’re not ready? Oh you’re lonely? Then go make friends. Don’t look for a partner to fill a void. Find fulfillment in yourself, then you can find someone to share that with. 

I’m not ready to date. I still think about my ex and I miss her, and I miss the companionship. I’ve recently started to fall for someone else, but I know I’m not in the right place to date right now, and my feelings are reciprocated anyways (I haven’t confessed anything, nor will I ever, as this person is a friend, and we met as friends, and I wouldn’t risk this friendship. Plus - think my late sister sent me to look after this person, but that’s a whole other story).

If I’m not in the right mind to date, I would not just waste my time, but the time of someone else, and pretty much guaranteed heartbreak. I realized now I truly have to be content with being alone, before i consider dating again.

I guess my only concern is, now that I’m living alone, once I’m okay with being alone, will I even want to date at that point. I think of how she (the person I have been developing feelings for) makes me feel when I’m around her or speaking with her, and I desire to have a partner like that. I guess I’m struggling with the idea of being content with being alone and the desire to feel the calm I feel when im talking to her.

"Seeing couples posting pictures together online, is it weird to ask my bf for the same thing? Okay, this itself might look stupid asf, but honestly I’m genuinely curious about how society views relationships nowadays. 

Me (20F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been together for a year. Both me and him have social media but we are not the type who post pictures or whatnot 24/7. For me, I post more than him and on special occasions or once in awhile if I enjoyed the events that occurred that day between me and him I would post it. Maybe one or two pictures (nothing extreme). While he, on the other hand, is only on social media for the memes and reels. Though, he does post pictures (sometimes) and majority of those posts are what he’s done on his own. 

Which is fine, but it’s very rare for me to see something that involves me and him. And when I joke about it he simply tells me “I don’t post anything.” 

See, I wouldn’t mind it as much if that were the case but I’m seeing these couples who do post pictures of themselves together, and it’s not too much, but it’s still something to show appreciation for each other. And even when one person post a selfie or something their significant other is quick to like and even leave a comment here or there. There’s even some people that say “if he doesn’t post you drop him because it only means he’s trying to keep his options open,” or something along those lines. 

I see this all the time, and even hear it from my friends as well. Before, things like this weren’t big of a deal for me, but recently I just wish for him to at least post something of me to show appreciates me in a way. 

I know this is wrong to say but I sometimes feel jealous or sad when I see my friends get this sort of treatment and I simply don’t. Even asking about it makes me uncomfortable and even like I’m being overbearing to him. 

A part of me wishes he would maybe comment sweet things when he sees me post something or even post something about us once in awhile, but I feel like I’m crossing a boundary and asking too much. 

Am I asking too much for wanting something like this? And is it normal for guys to not post pictures of their girlfriends?

"Can different fun time drives ruin relationships? Hi long time Reddit reader here. I’ve never posted anything but I figured it might help to get this out since I don’t any one to really talk to about this. Also this is 18+ can’t figure out how to put it on here. 

I (20F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together for about a year and a half. For a bit of context: we have known each other since we were kids and even lived down the street from each other. I had the biggest crush on him when we were in middle school but we remained friends for the sake of our friendship. Well fast forward a few years and we’re in our senior year. After a lot of stuff at his house, he ended up moving in at my moms for the second semester of our senior year. Yes we had to share a room but I had a giant beanbag he slept on and we never did anything. 

In October of 2021, we got the apartment we’re at now and have been here since. We didn’t start even talking about our feelings for each other until February and then eventually we got together in April of 2022. 

Here’s where it gets a little more relevant. 

I was a virgin when me and my boyfriend got together but he’s been active since he was about 15. Now I’ve never had a problem with that. It’s a small town and honestly I didn’t care because we weren’t together at that point. 

We went through that honeymoon phase where there was a bunch of making out whenever we could, constantly texting each other, you get the idea. And we’re doing great now even after we “calmed down”. And he was always patient with me when I said I wanted to wait. Well about late February we finally sealed the deal. And it was amazing. I found a side of myself I really like. 

But now it seems he just doesn’t want to get intimate anymore. At first we had a lot of makeout sessions and fun time. Then slowly it’s turned into a couple of kisses lead to fun time. I miss those makeout sessions where he pays attention to my body. Make me feel beautiful. Now it’s a feel kisses and then it. Nothing more. Afterwards he plays his game or something. I realize I have a much higher fun time drive than him and he says it’s bc he had all his fun growing up and that I’m just starting it. But he doesn’t want fun time if he isn’t in the mood and it’s gotten to the point that I quit initiating it because it hurt to keep getting turned down. He told me I could use some of our toys but those never really worked for me. We went two weeks without fun time. we finally had fun and he said it was because of the leggings. He wasn’t in the mood until I went out in leggings. 

We’ve talked about it and he said I could use the toys but he can’t help it if he’s not in the mood. So the other day I was really bothered and said I was going to take a long shower. I went looking for the toys and he (while on the Xbox with his friends) asked jokingly, “oh going to have some fun time in there?” 

I said “yeah that’s why it’s gonna be a long shower”

He looked at me shocked and asked if I was serious. I said yes bc he said if I was bothered to use toys if he wasn’t in the mood. He said he didn’t I actually would. I asked when would I have time to do it? Bc our schedules are almost exactly the same except for our days off and I can’t exactly going a a full week like that or I’ll be a mess and angry. I got too embarrassed and just took a normal shower. But even then. With that big hint. We didn’t have fun until almost a week later. He used to take showers with me and that was where our make out sessions usually started at lately. But now I get maybe a shower with him every month?? 

God I just feel like I’m losing my mind. Is this normal? Is it normal to react this way? 

I’m just ranting honestly. And don’t let all of that give you the wrong impression of him. He is one of the most amazing guys I have met. He’s so sweet and attentive and helpful. He gets me coffee in the morning our days off whether I’m still asleep or don’t feel like getting up. He will listen when I’m mad and let me rant about everything. He gives me space when I’m mad. Gives me kisses and back rubs when I had a bad day. And this man has a super tough job with long hours so I try not hold it against him but when we’ve talked so many time and he’s worked here just under a year and a half, it’s hard to let it go sometimes I guess.

I just feel like he doesn’t find me attractive or something anymore. He shows me he loves me in every other way so I feel like it’s ridiculous to feel like this.

"Guy (22M) I’ve (22F) been dating for a 4 months seems to have a crush on one of his friends from where he used to live. 
He used to live in Arizona for school. He said that over there he got into alot of shit had not many friends. Then by the end before he was going to move he calmed down a bit and ended up being friends with this girl. 

In the beginning of us dating he would bring her up a lot by showing me pictures she’d send him of her cute animals. He never would mention her name or anything just say “they”. One day I got very annoyed and asked is this person non-binary or what why do you keep saying they? She wasn’t. I openly talk about my guy friends so it just seemed weird to me. 

I ask why he says they for her but for guy friends he uses proper pronouns. He said he didn’t realize he was doing it it was just bc his ex didn’t like that he’s friends with her. I ask why and he said it’s because his ex didn’t like how close him and his friend are. I asked if him and his friend ever had anything more than just friend and he said that she’s pretty and all but it never turned into anything more than friends. He told me that they did flirt a lot when they first met, and the most that ever happened was them cuddling and watching a movie..  idk he had only known her for a few months so. 

He also told me that his ex found out how close they were by going on his phone and seeing but apparently she never said what bothered her. I also found out that while he was dating his ex he had to go back to Arizona for a week to get something done and apparently he spent most of his time with his friend. He said his ex got upset because he’d barley respond since he was busy with this friend and missed them. He said he was staying at a hotel alone and the only time his friend went into the hotel was to do his hair since she’s a hair dresser. 

He mention she has a cool niche hobby and later on he says he wants to get into a hobby like that. She sends a corny video she made that idk I don’t find funny then he sends it to me laughing saying how funny it is. I’m kinda starting to think I should just keep my distance now. It has been getting pretty serious with him and I don’t know what I should do or how to go about this. Or if I’m overthinking. Advice pleasee. I’m scared of just being the second opinion.. I wonder what it would be like if she lived in the same town as us.

"Does it creep you out when someone asks you out? I (27m) recently went to breakfast with an acquaintance (22m) who's soon going to take some of the same career paths that I took. He asked if we could meet and I agreed, thinking it would be a big bro - little bro kind of conversation. 

I show up and get a table and he arrives shortly afterwards and it quickly becomes clear to me that this is a date to him. I've known he is gay but have not expressed my own sexuality, so I took a moment to let him know that I'm straight and not interested in him that way, but would be happy to remain an acquaintance as a resource for him as he moves forward. 

He agrees and the food arrives and he keeps complimenting my beard and telling me I'm pretty and his type and his foot never seemed to stay on his side of the table. I began to feel more and more uncomfortable as the meeting progressed and he continued to make it seem like a date, asking me personal questions that had nothing to do with the aforementioned ""working relationship"".

I left the diner with a sour taste in my mouth, feeling like my wishes weren't respected and that this kid was walking all over me.

I can't believe that girls and women have to deal with this all the time. 

Personally, I like to think that I am good about respecting a ""no"" from a girl that I ask out, or when she turns down a second date even though I want one. I can't help but hurt inside to think that I might have made people feel powerless, uncomfortable, and without escape on a date, and that I pressed the issue.

"Is she [17F] interested and should I [18M] ask her on a date to know for sure? First off, don’t worry about the girl being under 18 since the age of consent in the country I live in is 15.

So I’ve been texting a girl over a dating app for the past few days. She matched with me and I was surprised and encouraged to see her text me first since her bio clearly stated that she doesn’t text first. I saw that as a sign of her possibly being particularly interested. I’ve also noticed that she isn’t very active on the app but that from what I’ve noticed she seems to open the app to answer my texts only (due to an activity feature telling you when a user was last on the app). Meaning she doesn’t seem to be actively trying to match with others atm.

Usually I’m the one bringing the conversation forward which isn’t a good sign but her answers are always more intricate than they would’ve needed to be.

I'm a woman of very high standards. I'm not gonna lower my standards for anybody, especially not some random online who I am meeting for the first time.

if i was an 18-24 year old catholic conservative woman, how would i spend most of my time? i would think reading books, staying at home, helping take care of my family. any other ideas?",divinedraco,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159dczw/how_to_find_conservative_woman/,1690302524.0,0.43

"(NSFW) My ex girlfriend harrases me, stalks me and has inappropiate stuff about me and I don't know what to do So, I'm a teen boy (not comfortable saying my age) and I just got out of a really toxic, almost dangerous online relationship. My girlfriend was really sweet at first, she always complimented me, made gifts for me and comforted me, and we could talk for HOURS, I loved her, however some things about her started to make me feel... Weird. 
(Before I continue the story, I'll add some context: My ex is poly and I'll refer to her as E, she was dating my (now) friend at the same time she was dating me, and I'll refer to him as M. E broke up with another lover of hers a week after starting to date me, then they got back and broke up again- and I'll refer to her as S, now, let's continue.)

-She was jealous on an abnormal amount to the point I got isolated because she would scare my friends away.

-She had favoritism, she prefered me over M and S and that was pretty obvious, when she talked to me about S she was like ""Uhh I guess we're dating but I'm not really close with her yk :/"" and she barely mentioned M, however she announced the entire world we were dating and that she loved me, I also feel like she was using me for clout because I have a fair amount of followers online because I upload animations but who knows.

-She never EVER informed any of us when she started dating other ppl at the same time she was dating us or asked for consent, I contacted S and M when I knew they were dating E and talked about it and they both said they had no idea about each other, and I had no idea about them neither, I just knew by accident.

-I was scared to make her mad because she would make a big scandal threatening to delete her social media, insulting her partners and victimizing herself on her accs.

-She lied about being kidnapped (she half admitted it) and made an account pretending to be her kidnapper threatening to hurt her (E) and harrasing us (M and me, especially me? And S didn't know because they already broke up for the first time at that point) and she made a huge drama when we called her out, even blaming M? Then we both broke up with her and she started to date S again THAT SAME DAY and acted lovey-dovey with her.

She did more, way more, really, mostly targeted at me (like disrespecting my grieving, making fun of me, asking me to do sexual stuff I wasn't comfortable with, and whenever I said no she would insist until I accepted, so I pray every day she doesn't show that stuff to anyone). As I said, M broke up with her after the kidnapping incident but stayed as friends, and I decided to give her another chance so we were together again, however I just couldn't handle it anymore and broke up with her because M told (and showed) me she tried to date him again without asking me for my consent, and she also made him uncomfortable with that, and right after that I see a message of her that was like ""Hey, could you ask M to stop being so nice with you? I'm kinda jealous lol"". So I let my anger take the best out of me and I insulted her and broke up with her, and she was almost begging for me to not break up with her, but I told her to screw off. M texted me kinda disappointed of me ig? And showed me E sent him our conversation, I told him I regret being so aggresive. It should have ended up here, right? NO

She made like 5 Pinterest boards with texts either insulting me and expressing on detail how she wants to hurt me or saying how she loves, misses me AND STALKS ME? Made a video victimizing herself and texted me almost everyday asking for forgiveness, I didn't block her because I didn't thought she was going to do this, and if I blocked her I wasn't going to be able to see her account and I wanted to take screenshots of those boards to have proof of her harrasement, so I just ignored her, and her texts started to get more and more aggresive passing the days. M was really concerned because he saw those boards too, but he started to date her again days after that incident... And I feel so betrayed because he knows everything I went through, before they started dating I told him I wouldn't recommend being friends with her, he didn't really care, and just some days ago he vents to me about how he doesn't feel really loved by her and when he tried to talk about it she would ignore him... And I was SO mad, not only at E for making him feel that way but also at M for not listening my advice, I didn't tell him that (and I don't think I will) because I knew it was disrespectful so I just comforted him, but I'm still really annoyed and I feel bad for being annoyed because I know it's not really his fault.

Anyways, some days ago M disappeared suddendly from the internet and didn't even leave my messages on read so I was worried because I know he lives in **really** bad conditions irl so I feared the worse. I decided to text E about it out of desesperation, she told me she didn't know anything and changed the topic asking if I was dating someone, I was confused so I asked ""Why are you asking that?"" And she went like ""What!? I can't know!? I'm just curious :/ Yes or no!?"" AND I WAS LIKE HUH????? Luckily M messaged me saying he was grounded but he's okay so it was a relief, I tried to tell him about my conversation with E and he kind of ignored it? So I don't think I'll tell him...
Just some days ago I was talking with S and we were sharing our experiences with E and she told me I should expose her because I'm the one who got treated the worse by her and so there are no more victims anymore but I don't know... I'm scared, I don't want her to expose that inappropiate stuff about me, and I'm scared people will call me dramatic, but more than that, I'm scared to loose M if I do this, I need an adult that is willing to help me, please. :(

Edit: I don't know if this post belongs in this sub but I didn't know where to post it and I just need help because she's still harrasing and stalking me. She still posts stuff targeted at me, just less intense messages than before luckily.

Edit 2: I forgot an important detail: The first time I broke up with her, she literally made an account with a similar username and pfp as her ""kidnapper's"" (only difference being like 2 letters), asked if we could be friends and said that me and E were the cutest couple ever. This time she did almost the same thing and even made a video about me, I showed M once I realized and he said it's suspicious but to not make assumptions... Idk about that... The accounts were made the same days I broke up with her and her first account only changed like two letters of their ""kidnapper's"" username. (Example: let's say the ""kidnapper's"" acc was ii_Kitty_pop, the account she probably made was named idk ii_Kitty_lol..)",Idk_yet_aaa,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158uv15/nsfw_my_ex_girlfriend_harrases_me_stalks_me_and/,1690251658.0,0.67

"How do you get over your lovers exes? My (19f) boyfriend (18m) is not sure about staying or leaving this relationship of one year. 
One of the main factors, or maybe even a deal breaker, is that I have an ex, and more important to my bf - me and my ex slept thogether (while dating before I met my by and I met my bf after I ended things with rat, I mean ex).
Now, since this is far away in my last I couldn't care less about it, but he does.
He told me today how quote ,, I knew you had ex but I didn't know you slept with him "" after that I found old messages of him and I that proved that he in fact did know that too, since like day 5 of dating, after finding out he told me ,, I wish I was your first but let's focus on future"". Oh my how did it went so wrong? For few months I was bombarded with jealous about ex I'm in no damn contract with anymore and this is when I made a mistake defending myself how ""it's just my past I can't change it"" instead of being more gentle.
Now, until few days ago i thought he's way over it, turns out he thinks about it every single day for a long period of time and it got to the point where he's been unhappy because of it.

"Am I wrong for expecting to not go home hungry after I was asked on a date that included food? Didn't get any food for the entirety of the first date he planned? Went home hungry lmao

For context this is someone I met in public. I'm 25 and hes 39.From the start,the excessive over complimenting,future faking,and just extremely intense need to express his attraction towards me and constantly asking my thoughts on him and if I feel the same overwhelmed me a bit. I had to tell him to slow down,I've started my only 2 relationships very fast and I don't want to rush. 

He asks me to a movie and burgers afterward. In our convo in the parking lot,I mention if he likes movie snacks. He says no but asks about me. I say I enjoy nachos,but if I plan on getting food after I'm fine with a soda. Upon entering the theater,we see how insane the concession stand is,and although we had 30+ mins till the movie,he bypassed it and took me to the theater. I have my own money,so 5 mins into previews I tell him I'm getting up to get my drink. That is until a preview caught my attention,and another and another (ADHD),until next thing I knew the movie was starting. I was chewing gum and I just accepted that id be hungry for a bit. But movie was 2.5 hours lmao. I was starving afterwards but to my disappointment we got in his car and drove me home. He asks me what I plan to do for food on the drive (that confused me since I expected us to get something) so I mention me probably ordering something since the food places in my area are closed. Later in that conversation we're discussing diets/eating habits and I mention not having eaten all day (my fault,something I do). After I said it I wished I hadn't because I didn't want it to seem like I am expecting something from him. So after being dropped off I got my own food. Down to my last moments in his car,he's complimenting and hugging me etc. Idk why but I feel this is enough for me to not want a second date. But idk how to tell him. It just seemed all about him with little regard to how I feel. He was my ride,I would've been fine with hitting up a fast food place. But it felt odd asking. Am I overthinking this?

He had brought his cousin (Jess) who is using a cane,I think she is the most attractive thing I’ve seen. And I heard her whispering about me from a distance to her female cousin (nat) and joe. Moments later I see her walk in front of me and ask her about the cane until suddenly her female cousin starts asking and pressuring why I wanna know and saying that I shouldn’t even ask her about that to start a convo.

But now my feelings for him are getting stronger day by day. But there's a problem I'm gay and he looks like a typical straight mean guy but I believe he likes me too

 I tell you why, so from few weeks I have noticed some signs I mean there's always some kind of sexual tension between us. Like 2 days ago I went to a party I got super drunk, got wild and there was some random dude who tried to take advantage of me but Noah came in and saved me and dropped me home (a friend of mine told me abt this Incident bcoz I didn't remember anything as I was drunk Asf) . he behaves kind of awkward when I'm around. also I have caught him staring at me a few times. he argues/fights with me a lot like last week he was fighting with one of friend so I stepped in to support  her (I can't resist a fight LMAO) and I called him a as_hole and Some other bad cuss words too .

 I know he has a really short temper like if u curse him, be prepared to get your ass beaten up.I knew it but still, I cussed at him bcoz a part of me knows that he wouldn't hurt me. Also I like to test his patience LMAO. We both have a love and hate relationship. hate is mutual and love is from my side I don't know about him. I want to ask him if he's interested in me but don't want to make it awkward. do u guys think that does he has feelings for me? Please give your opinions in the comment section.

He maybe a total nut job but the one thing I really like about him is the way he treats his sister. Like he really respect  her and very protective towards her. It's cute right? 

Tldr, I can't control loving this bad guy in my school even if he acts like total moron. He appears to be to typical straight guy but I think hes not I think he's gay or at least bi . I have noticed some signs which point towards that he prob interested in me what do  U guys think?

"""Why are you so good to me?""- what does this text mean from GF- Red flag? She made that comment after i told her i want her to come over and she said she was really busy.I kinda just said ok and told her that it was the only time to see eachother before holidays.She acted busy and later we get texting and she said shes in a phase where I shouldn't take doesnt understand how she feels,and not to expect anything she says me.She said it's about her overall life .

I just assured her that I'm always there for her and then she said ""Why are you so good to me""

 For background- Started talking 6months ago/going out and started dating soon after.We are gf/bf ,exclusive in our early 20s .She had no relationship before this one.I think our relationship is abit slower than usual,she hasn't meet my parents or I haven't meet hers.We haven't been intimate either,just making-out and holding hands/hugging.

She sometimes really cold hearted and sometimes really fun and lovey.I feel like she struggles to commit to me/our relationship.We try to talk about everything but,she doesnt tell me everything. I always try to get to hangout,text her ,compliment her, give her flowers.We did have a point where she said she doesnt know how she feels about us,that she didn't know what to do in a relationship and kept saying she's doesnt know how's she feels but she can't lose me or doesnt want to let me go.",Glad-Mousse-7298,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1591ec3/why_are_you_so_good_to_me_what_does_this_text/,1690271203.0,0.67

"Online Profile Advice I’m very tired of seeing people make the same photo mistakes in their online dating profiles and I often have the urge to help them but there’s not a way to give unsolicited feedback there, so I’ll do general advice here instead: 

1. Your first photo should be just of you! And your face should not be obscured (by a hat or by sunglasses). People should be able to see what you look like easily.

2. It’s great that you have friends! But they’re not who the potential partner is looking to date. Limit group photos to 2 maximum. 

3. Photos of you doing fun hobbies is great! It shows you’re interesting and gives the potential date something to talk to you about. But you should still be identifiable in the photos. If the photo really obscures you, rethink using it. 

4. Have you drastically changed your hair (facial hair included)? Then don’t use old photos that don’t look like you anymore. Don’t have enough recent photos? Ask a friend to do a little photo shoot! (Might be dorky, but it’s better to have a fun picture of you in the park than a photo that’s 3 years old and is no longer accurate). 

5. I know it’s sunny outside, but unfortunately sunglasses in every photo means no one can see what you look like. You should be confident in yourself and let people see your face! Limit sunglass photos to 2 maximum. 

6. You don’t need to smile in every photo, but you should be smiling in some of them. I know it can be miserable using online dating, but let’s not let the person you want to match with know that you’re completely jaded. 

That’s just a few hints and I hope it can help someone. Good luck out there everyone, I know it can be rough.",Responsible_Rip394,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158wd02/online_profile_advice/,1690255722.0,1.0
"Flakey Hot Girl 

Hey everyone, just to be clear I understand we are not in a relationship just ""casually dating""


Early this year around March 2023, I met this cute white girl at the beach. I'm black by the way. We are both 22. When I met her we were at the basketball courts on the beach. I was with a my cousin and had made a bet that I could get her number. Mind you before I walked over it was just her and a older gentlemen on the court. As soon as I walk over to make my approach it's likes dudes just came out of no where trying to cock block me and talk to her. It was so many dudes that we had enough for a 5 Vs 5 basketball game. Of course all the dudes wanted to be on her team but somehow me and her ended up being on teams. These dudes were trying there hardest against us. leven got a clean block on the dude who tried to cock block me lol. I had to Cary of course but we still lost. After the game she came up to me and said that I was really good and she apologized for being bad. Of course I took this as an opportunity to Rizz. Now remember the older gentleman she was with well it turns out that was her ""roommate"" and they have been living together for a few months. She just moved to CA September
2022. Of course I got her #. A few weeks pass and man it's like pulling teeth trying to get this girl on the phone or out on a date. One day I lose my phone and all contacts and had to get new phone. Then one day in June I get a text at around 11:00pm asking to hang out. I don't have the number sal V so l assume it's one of my homies and agree. BUt I actually turned out to be her. I pick her up because my car was in the shop and we go back to my place and she is a freak. Definitely some of the best head I ever got and she was tight. But she left her spend the night bag in a Uber. She said that I'm the first guy she been with since moving to LA but I don't believe that. I try to hit her up and make sure she had a good time because she was really drunk and I did not want any Me 2 situations but she was cool but dry text and convo. Later I get her bag from the Uber driver and offers to return it when we hang out again she agrees. But At the time of date she tries to push it back for hours later. I let her know that time doesn't work for me and we can plan another time. She hits me up again on a late night say she is bored and wants to hangout and if I can bring her bag. I agree but I don't respond as fast as the first time and take a while to get to her house but none the less I come. When I get there she tells me some story about how her friend threatened to kill her self and that she can no longer hangout. She ask if I had her bag though and I say no I can bring it later or we can go get it rn from my house but she declined then hoped in another car. I don't care if she is seeing other guys/girls or what not I just want her to respect my time, and to continue have sex with her. She really likes bdsm and I think I do to. I didn't 't like it until I meet her. She is really sexy and feminine around me besides the flakes. It seems like she cares more about her bag than me.

Anyone can figure out what scanning of the body means if he is gay and not into that? One time he also mentioned to me he likes big boobs and he was referring to the person we saw who had one.

I’m wondering who else is feeling like their entire life force is being sucked out by online dating. 

It makes me want to poke my eyeballs out sometimes, but I had a revelation that it’s 100% not the people that are on there. It’s not really about the people that I interact with or even having less success than others. I just HATE the online format, the prompts, and the way conversations unfold on hinge/bumble/tinder. It’s just so unbelievably mundane 95% of the time, and I know that there are a lot of cool, fun, and easy to talk to people IRL.

"My (25M) crush (25F) seemed very interested and worried if i date or like another woman but when i confessed she said she need to think about it Hello guys, my first post here, hope you guys help me with my situation 


TLDR: she seemed interested and worried if i actually date or like another girl, but when i confessed to her she said ill need to think about it with a smiley face. Any advice on what should I do next?

Here are the details: 

So here is the story, i have that coworker that i really like who i knew several months now, we've been talking here and there but never been very close and never told her my feelings, instead i believed she is taken so always tried to avoid being close so i lose interest. We didn't see each other for a while and i felt like i really need to see her so i texted her over skype when we had the same shift. 

Surprisenly she suggested to add me on Instagram and wanted to see me as well, on my break i was about to go to the next floor to her station just to find out she is already looking for me! So i took as avery clear sing

During convo, she asked me from no where if a girl X (another coworker) is my friend since she saw us before and now she works with her on the same department, i said not a close friend, She answered because you ""guys look close"".., (however ive invited that girl X before but i lost interest very quickly and kept her as friend, i dont if she told her something)

However I didn't focus on that question and i was just decided to tell her about my feelings next day.

So today i texted her agin to meet and i told her directly that i like her, she had a positive body language and reaction but she immediately said ""but i thought you actually like the girl X"", i said ""what? No i dont, even if i maybe did before i quickly lose interest when i smell a toxic trait"" and promised to tell her the full story later,, she was smiling and playfully asked so i actually met all your boundaries? .. however we kept laughing at it for a while and i asked about her answer, she said ""i need to think about it"". 

That got me really confused, is she actually need to think about it since maybe she thought i have no interest in her and i actually like the other girl and now she need to reconcider things? she showed many positive sings and when she said it she was smiling and laughing instead of being uncomfortable with a ""sorry"" body language. On the other hand if she is actually interested and want the same she would just say yes, people use ""ill think about it"" to politely say no and maybe that smile is just how she is.

I really like this girl, i usually lose interest very fast but this girl really got me, and no matter how much time i tried to avoid her yet she never left my mind, am now really confused and i don't know if its worth it to wait or should i bring the subject up again to her and ask her to make it clear for me?? Or should i just leave her alone and move on

"Feeling alone in this generation I want to know if other people feel the way I do cause I feel alone.

I just feel like dating in this current generation is horrible now.

1) I feel like socia media ruined it. 

2) I feel like pureness and dating to marry is not a thing anymore. 

3) I also feel like everything is just about sex.
People don't want to get to know each other anymore, as it's straight to sex. I know sex is important but i'll never understand people that does it without feelings. Respectfully, not hating on it. I just don't get it how. I prefer intimacy with someone special that loves me as well.

4) I also feel like people don't  try to fix problems in a relationship anymore, they go straight to cheating when things don't go their way.

5) I have barelt met gentleman guys.
(Opening doors/car doors ect)

I'm craving and want old flashion love. Feels like finding a gem in this generation is a rare thing. I might have a higher chance to win the lottery.

"Got randomly ghosted and am going through it I (25M) met a girl at a friends party earlier this month and we hit it off right away. I asked to see her again and we’ve gone on a few dates which ended with me spending the night at her place twice (we didn’t have sex just talked all night). Well the other night I slept over again and I asked her what the next move was and she told me she really liked me but because she had only gotten out of a 4 1/2 year relationship 4 months ago she wasn’t looking to jump back into one. I told her I understood and said as long as we still have fun together we can keep seeing where things go to which she agreed. Well yesterday I texted her and it’s been over 24 hours with no reply. I feel dumb for liking someone so much so soon since I’ve been in long term committed relationships before but I guess I was just infatuated by her. Regardless it’s pretty painful right now and I guess I just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading

Update:

Thank you everyone first and foremost for the nice comments. She finally responded to me saying she doesn’t think she can continue things this way because she isn’t ready for a relationship but thanked me for all the sweet things I did for her.

I’m definitely more on the traditional side and I like calling people that I’ve got a romantic interest in but I have never heard someone reciprocate the same opinion. Is it me? Is it outdated now?

"My (25M) Ex gf (23F) of 2 years and several months moved on quick I devoted so much physical and emotional effort into making that relationship work. I held myself accountable for my actions at the very beginning of us dating when it was a bit rocky. Eventually I asked her to my girlfriend and I believe that our relationship flourished only temporarily after that. We were pretty solid up until nearly our 2 year mark when I found out that she had been doing things behind my back that was in the direction of cheating. All while I was attending school, working, enjoying hobbies, and focusing on the relationship, she began to become a stressful burden for me after a year and a half and the final incident was the last straw. I still remember very vividly the night when she told me “I don’t know you deal with me. I feel like I’m too much sometimes.” I feel like such a dummy for saying “because I love you.” Yeah that was so bad. I did love her though. She knew it too. I asked her why she did the things she did and her only excuse was “I feel like we don’t do enough dates. I feel like you don’t take me serious enough.” I explained to her that I’ve been trying my best and that we already had something planned that week after. Overall, I realized it was a terrible excuse for her to cover herself. During the last few months of our relationship, I believe my subconscious was telling me to evacuate that relationship because I felt no Peace but anxiety and worry. Finally I packed up and left our apartment when I realized things wouldn’t change. 

We have been broken up for 2 months now. I still think of her. Slowly feeling better. However, I don’t think I can date for a while now. I feel like I have to focus on other things and I’m not capable of loving intimately right now.

Finally ,the point. I have a good friend (we’ll call him A) that has a gf (we’ll call her B) that has her on social media. I asked B recently if she knows how my ex is doing and she basically said that shouldn’t matter to you anymore but she did move on pretty fast with someone else. It hurt so bad knowing that she moved on quickly when I still feel devastated about the break up. Not really emotionally devastated but I guess I’m 
In shock and a little disappointed that she didn’t see our relationship the same way I saw it. How has this played out for anyone that has dealt with this? I feel like it’s pretty common

"When you're being cold to someone you love in order to push them away, does it also hurt you? A man and I were/are deeply in love with each other, and he was the sweetest and kindest man I'd ever been with. But due to drama on his end, he had to be the one to hold the knife and end our connection for good until we've both healed. Whenever we tried to end things in the past, he tried to end things gently, and it was always clear he was also hurting when he was hurting me.  
  
But this time, when we finally ended things for good, he took a different approach. He was the coldest he'd ever been with me. When I asked him if he was being cold to push me away, he said yes. He needed to be clear in order to not unintentionally give me hope and lead me on any further. I was clearly hurt by his new coldness, but he showed no sign of his hurt or was put into a position where he couldn't show any sign of him feeling terrible while he was hurting me.  
  
So yeah, does it also hurt you when you're being cold to someone you love to push them away? Do you feel bad about it? I'm left questioning and have always been curious about this question for a while anyway.

"My boyfriend stole my medication from me. 
Hello, I have ADHD and take Adderall. I got my new prescription today of 20 mg, because I have a very hard time focusing. It is severe. I normally have to wear ear plugs, with headphones, with brown noise to completely focus, and even then I can be distracted. I take adderall and it is helpful. I’m in the medical field so I constantly have to study everyday. It’s hard to do that with ADHD when focusing is such a big problem. I am also different medications for other reasons.  
I had some empty medication bottles on the TV stand - completely empty. Today, I opened my new adderall medication bottle, and I took a pill and left the bottle on the computer stand which is in the same room. I was gone the whole day studying and my boyfriend was home. 

Later today, I was looking for something and found that one of the empty bottles from the TV stand was in the dresser and it had two pills of my adderall medication. I was very confused, because I literally opened the bottle today and I never transferred any pills to another bottle - There was no point in doing that, it makes no sense. The two adderall pills were inside a whole different medication bottle. This medication bottle was specific for my bipolar II. This medication bottle was empty. Now, there were two adderall pills in the bottle.  

My boyfriend was there when I opened the bottle and stood there in confusion. I even asked him if he took these by any chance and he denied it. I didn’t want to pester it, but he saw how confused I was the whole time because I kept wondering how that happened. I didn’t want to keep pestering him because I didn’t want him to think I didn’t trust him, but it makes no sense for me to have put them there. Why would I transfer my adderall into an empty bottle for a whole different medication? And, specifically why two?  

I truly think he wanted to try them and took them without my permission. A part of me thinks I’m going crazy even though I obviously didn’t transfer anything. How is that logical of me to do? It isn’t. Do I think he stole them? Yes, and I feel awful thinking that way but it makes the most sense to me. Am I mad? Not mad, but disappointed.  

He knows how important these medications are for me. I only get a thirty day supply. I'm a student who is in an intense field and needs them to focus. I struggle so much with focusing. He doesn’t study. He works. He doesn’t have ADHD. He's not on any medications. Adderall is one of those drugs that people love to try and abuse. People make money selling it. It took me a little over a year to be prescribed adderall due to this reason. I tried countless medications, all with severe side effects, and for some reason, adderall was the best fit for me. I don’t appreciate this at all. A part of me doesn’t want to believe he did this, but then it makes me go crazy. Then, I start wondering if I did something with it. I get fixated on the whole thing. I know I didn't transfer anything. It wouldn't make any sense for me to do that.   

This was a VERY inconsiderate and selfish thing to do. I know deep down he tried to steal them. But, how do I get him to admit that he did? I don’t want to come off as too strong since I genuinely want to discuss this with him and why it’s upsetting. But, how can I do that if he doesn’t admit to it? I want to ask him in a way where he won’t feel as if I am attacking him, because then I doubt he will ever admit to it. I would really love to sit down and talk about this, because this is concerning. But, I can't talk to him about it if he does not admit to it. Does anyone have any advice on how I can approach this in a way that will result in a meaningful conversation?  As someone who is actively working on her mental health, this has been very stressful.

TL;DR - boyfriend tried stealing my medication, but won’t admit it. how can i bring this up without making him feel like he’s being attacked. i would like to have a genuine conversation about this, but i need to find a way for him to own up to what he did

"Should I give up on this guy? Will he never want me? Am I friendzoned? There's this guy who I've been somewhat hanging out with. Not really. We met 2 months ago and have been hanging out in person for only 2 times a month so far. We have not had sex. We only cuddled and made out once, then we slept together on the same bed without having sex. When we go out, he pays for everything. Nothing too fancy, just basic ""date"" stuff like movies, casual restaurants, the arcade, other fun activities. Unfortunately I don't think he considers them dates. At first, before we met, I told him if we could date and he said he would have to see where it goes, typical sign of disinterest. I gave it a shot knowing that it's not going to end well, now I'm so confused.

  
Why does he keep talking to me and hanging out with me if he isn't attracted to me? I've explicitly told him that I find him sexy, hot, that I masturbate to him, he makes me wet, now I've been VERY straightforward about my sexual and romantic interest in him. I've told him, straight up, that I want to have sex with him and give him a blowjob (through texts). Very explicit. Yet he doesn't respond to this. He'll change the subject and start talking about something else.

  
\*I\* had to initiate the makeout + cuddle session. In fact, I'm the one who initiated EVERY touch. When we held hands while walking in the park the first time we met, it's because I asked him to. When we hugged after the movies, I asked him. EVERY hug has been initiated and asked by me. I had to invite him over to my place and get turned down MULTIPLE TIMES until he finally agreed like a month later. I even wanted him to come over after our first ""date"" (not... first time we met rather), but he said no. To this day I continue to invite him over while he ignores me and changes the subject. Getting him to come over to my place is like pulling impacted wisdom teeth.

  
He also keeps postponing. EVERY hangout has been postponed so far except July 4th, I guess because it was a holiday.

  
WHY WOULD HE MAKEOUT AND CUDDLE WITH ME, BUT NOT HAVE SEX WITH ME? WHY DOES HE NOT EVEN WANT A BLOWJOB FROM ME? I'm very unattractive, I know that, but why would he continue to talk to someone he isn't attracted to if I've made my interest in him clear? Does he like being molested by some abomination then? He said he's planning to hang out with me again.

  
I asked him why does he even keep me around. He said ""it's nice to have someone to do things with"". So is that all then? Just someone to hang out with when he has nothing and no one else? This is the friendzone, right? Or worse?

"Still want to have sex with my ex after we broke up So basically, I(F21) broke up with my bf(M22) around 3 weeks ago. I felt like I was over him at that moment. We were still in love with each other at that point, I just didn't want to invest in that relationship anymore because I felt like our relationship would go nowhere because of some of his decision (I thought he was the one). We agreed on still being friends. 

I went on vacation for a week and intentionally ignored his text to get over him. However, when I returned to the city, my feeling for him got stronger. I texted him something like ”I want us to cut off completely, be strangers after this month, so if you want, we can be a couple again or ”friends” for the rest of the month” (deep down in me wanted him to pick being a couple again for the rest of the month, but he didn't)

About 2 days after the text, we video-called each other, and he suddenly got hard because he thought I was naked, so he came over and we had sex. After that, we agreed to be fwb for the rest of the month, but he said he wanted to set a boundary that we won't get too intimate, like kissing. I convinced him that I wanted to kiss. I feel like I only want it because I want us to be a couple again. (I'm on my period, so idk if the hormone changes have an impact on this)

Idk why but since then, I've been really horny for him (I've never felt like this before). Idk if that's normal after you break up with someone and still have feeling for them. I’m not sure if he’s hiding it, but for me, it feels like he’s over the relationship when I'm not, and I was the one call it off.

"Confusing signals from girls I recently met an amazing girl at a dance party, and we hit it off right away. We danced intimately multiple times, had similar interests and values, there was a lot of physical flirtation on and off the dance floor. However, after I asked her out, she said she doesn't want to take things further, but still wants to dance and have fun together.

"A major issue in my thinking I’ve been questioning myself lately because I’ve constantly brought myself in the same situations over and over again in the last couple of months. 

I want to know what are the right things to search for in a girl.

I’ve always wanted a girl that’s cute to me (I’m not picky and have this specific type, but there are lots of girls who fit it so that’s not a problem), who’s at least a bit classier(polite) and smart, and who’ll hopefully love me back (but I sometimes feel that’s asking for too much). But in the last few months every girl like that I meet is either emotionally unavailable or just already in a relationship, which somehow makes me harder to get over it

I’ve dated girls who I respectively liked less and tried to convince myself to like them, but it just didn’t work and I had to break it off.

I got an advice that I seem to look for the wrong things, and if I start looking for the right things, I will find myself the perfect girl

"dating a poli person Edit: here is some important context i forgot and it’s probably helpful:
-Im 20f and he is 18m, he was my first everything and knew much more about sex then i did
-We are in a long distance relationship but the person i mention in the post lives in the same city has him.

Im dating a polyamory person and i think i am monogamous but i do like him a lot…
Sometimes he tells me about the other people he kisses or has dates with and sometimes im jealous or insecure which i think affects him… so i try to find a way to be supportive, i really like him.
Also im fat and i have a lot of insecurities around that and he has always has been very careful and respectful of that during intimate times and i know it really bothers him because he said he would like to see my body and those kind of things. I always ask that we’re in the dark soo i can feel more comfortable…
one of this days he just told me about some on he me and he said he would like to be in a date with them… he showed pictures of that person and everything after they met and told me how this person was soo skinny and he found it cute because he could just throw them around and “hold them by the waist” and it felt so good (the last particularly hurted me because i’ve told him i like to be hug/touched in that specific place but he doesn’t do it a lot with me).
i just feel bad… i dont know if im just jelaous but i fear he might like this person more… I’ve seen photos of them and they are prettier and skinnier and for what i see their intimate life works very well too and i think he cant do those things with me because im fat maybe?

"Can’t do dating apps/ can’t date in general When I (21F) first started having sex, I used dating apps for hookups. I have an avoidant attachment style so I never got easily attached to any hookups. However, I get very anxious when meeting new people no matter the situation (yes even a hookup), so I stopped using them. Moreover, some guys don’t get the hint that you don’t wanna take things further despite telling them outright and it got very tiring putting up with their texts just cause I felt bad for them. 

I’m not looking for a relationship. I’m still not fully over a guy I didn’t even date (it’s been almost a decade but that’s something I’ll have to deal with). Even if I start talking to someone - on a dating app or from elsewhere - I end up chickening out when things start to get serious. Because I’ll be using them to get over my crush and that’s not fair on them. I want to meet someone in real life and for things to happen naturally. I have friends who’ve had/ have boyfriends from dating apps. I’m happy for them but no matter how I look at it I would not want to say I met my boyfriend on a dating app. 

It’s probably because of the way I met my crush or the fact that it didn’t work out and I’m still not over it, I just can’t seem to date or even be open to the idea of a relationship unless it comes out of nowhere unexpectedly, like in the movies. I know it doesn’t only happen in the movies cause my friend is in such a relationship.

"Did I handle this wrong? So I’ve been interested in this girl for awhile, we have hung out a couple times over last month or two. Well yesterday we hung out went to the mall and got something to eat and talked for awhile. When I got home she texted me thanks for coming out and I said of course I like spending time with you. She then mentioned that she talks a lot with her friends and officially thinks we’re friends now, which for me is the nail in the coffin. I glossed over that and answered another one of her texts and then she asked back “is it ok if I call you my friend?”. I responded that “yes, but I kinda like you more than that, but I will back off that shit, sorry if that makes it awkward.” She didn’t respond back. So tonight I decided to text back “hey I’m really sorry, that was unfair of me to bring that up like that. I do appreciate your friendship and I didn’t mean to come off like I’m brushing

"Seeing a guy for four months, he said he loved me and now is changing his hinge location daily on his vacation. What to do? Title kinda says it all

I’ve been seeing a guy for four months, who I have known casually as an acquaintance for years.
He expressed early on he was very excited to be seeing me and that he finally had a chance etc.

I am slow to enter relationships so I was very happy to take it slow and keep seeing other people.

Then a few weeks before he left on this vacation he told me he loved me. We were not in an exclusive situation at that point and I was shocked by this. I don’t love him as I’ve only been seeing him a few months at this point but I say I like him a lot. But he made no attempt to make things exclusive and I was okay as I am fine with something more casual, but it was confusing.

Anyways, I go to look at his hinge profile and he had changed it to the location he was going for vacation and has continued to do so as he travels.

I was in no rush to get into anything, but this behaviour is off putting and making me feel confused, coming weeks after he said he loved me.

I would have considered something long term with him before this but now he feels untrustworthy with his words (him loving me) not matching his actions (changing his hinge stuff)

I can’t decide if I talk about this with him or just clock this as a summer fling and move on because his behaviour isn’t really giving long term material? Or does this make sense after he told me he loved me and then it wasn’t reciprocated and he’s just trying to slow down?

Does anyone have advice?",tickalockev,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158wi55/seeing_a_guy_for_four_months_he_said_he_loved_me/,1690256109.0,1.0
"Did he ever like me or did he just use me I had a bad dating experience a year ago and I’ve largely gotten over it but occasionally it flares up especially when I meet new people, so I want some help to process it. 

Long story short, a guy I met on hinge fervently pursued me/love-bombed me for a week (constant text messages) after the first date (we had good chemistry on the first date). On the second date I was a little tipsy and the circumstances lent to a very romantic environment and one thing led to another and we had sex (although going into the date I never thought we’d end up having sex). This was on a Friday. 

Guy was still attentive over the weekend, but he tried several times to come over to my place on Monday and I refused. He claimed to be super busy at work that week, and the texting frequency started to drop quite a bit. On Wednesday he spontaneously called me while I was watching a movie at home, and I let him come over this time; we ended up having sex again. He didn’t stay over. 

Then, no texts at all for the following two days, until he called me on Friday to say he’s been busy at work but he’ll think of me when he thinks of sth fun. That just sounded weird, so I sent him a text after the call to point out how much his effort dropped after he got sex. To this, he responded that he felt I was a little entitled and he wanted to take a break. Obviously now he was just trying to gaslight me and pump and dump.

I never reply and unmatch him on the dating app.

Funny twist is, 6 months later he send me several super long texts, saying that it was his birthday today and while celebrating with friends at a certain expensive restaurant (he named the restaurant) a conversation topic came up that reminded him of me. He apologized for not managing stress well/not treating me right, and hoped that someone was treating me like the queen I was (lolol!!!)

My gut feeling about his texts is, he either wanted to absolve his conscience of any guilt by being some closure to this, or he wanted to see if he could rekindle things with m perhaps after months of dating new people he realized I was the best he ever got, or maybe he just got horny and wanted to see if I might fall into his trap and have sex with him again.

Some more information: 1) he claimed to want a long-term relationship on his dating profile, 2)although he constantly texted for 4 days after the first date, he didn’t make plans to ask me out until I prompted him, 3) he made some casual flirty comments (in texting and on the second date) that seemed innocent and just flirty at the time but actually had a very sexual undertone when I reflected on things afterwards

My question is, it’s pretty clear he just used looking for LTR and love-bombing me as a way to get sex, but why he he text me 6 months later? I do think the most likely answer, although extremely disgusting to think about, is that he wanted to see if I would still be available for sex. But why did he do it on his birthday (I know it’s his real birthday)?

"How do I date if whenever I fall in love I lose myself? Whenever I like someone, I always end up fantasizing about a life together where we live euphorically with no struggles, I don’t have to work a day in my life, and I’m happy every day. 

I guess these are good thoughts to have but the problem is it always screws with my head. I’ll lose motivation at work because all I want to do is run through daisy fields, and I’ll become lazy and uninteresting as a person in general and stop pursuing hobbies or learning to just fantasize for most of the day (i.e. loving someone becomes my whole personality). 

My biggest concern is that I seemingly no longer want to work. But maybe this is my inner feminine coming out and it’s a sign that I wasn’t meant to work? I’ve been a workaholic for so long I don’t really know if what I truly want is to be CEO, but the minute I fall in love these workaholic desires all disappear anyway. But I digress.

I’m such an “objectively” better person in every way when I’m single- I am ambitious and successful at work, I have a variety of interests, I have a bunch of friends that I care about. When I fall in love it’s like a cocaine addiction and I don’t really know who I am anymore but all I know is that it feels so good. I feel that it is my calling to fall in love.

"Shall I get with a man I’m not attracted to? I usually get with physically attractive men, the sort with a lot of options, but lately I’m getting a bit tired of chasing them and dealing with their hot and cold games, and having to navigate their wannabe Patrick Bateman personalities, and I don’t know if it’s me who finds this, but I find the mood swings and anger are more likely with very attractive men. 

What do I do then? Shall I throw physical desire and attraction to the wind in favour of a more average or even unattractive looking man who will likely offer more stability, more obtainable for me and be more grateful to have Me? 

I worry how I will navigate it, I don’t get turned on easily and can usually only fully enjoy sex if it’s with a man I’m fully physically attracted to.

"How to not be an asshole about this? So I(M 35) met a woman(F30) briefly, and later she added me on Facebook, and, while I normal don't do this, I somehow wrote and phoned a lot with her, while I was 3 weeks on a trip (that's why we wouldn't meet for real), when I came back for different reasons till now, one week later, we couldn't meet(she is working some nights and it's like 40km), anyway we spoke and wrote the whole time.

But just this weekend, I was bored at Friday and wanted to go out having a drink, and I played around with tinder, got a match, wrote a little bit, and somehow just asked her if we would have some drinks, she said yes and we went on our date, I really hadn't so huge expectations, but we have been head over heels somehow the last 3 days(she lives only 1 km from my place), I know this can lead to problems, but I am just feeling it right now.

So I don't really feel like meeting the other woman, but I somehow feel it's unfair, as I haven't given her the chance to meet in Real Life for a date, and I feel bad because we wrote so much, and exchanged a lot (I kind of told her that texting doesn't do much for me, though).

I also don't feel like, lying to one of the two. And the first woman also is making comments about me not answerig like before.

Is it a good idea to call her tonight, and just explain things to her, how would you do this without being an asshole, I don't want to host her either.

"I think the guy I’m supposed to go on a date with tomorrow has a girlfriend. Should I ask her? Hi everyone, so I’m (25F) supposed to go out with this guy (29M) I matched with on Tinder tomorrow night. We’re both looking for something casual. He told me he got out of a relationship awhile ago and that they “just drifted apart”. 

Before I go out with any guy I always like to look them up on social media just to make sure there are no glaring red flags. Well, during my search I ended up finding some pretty recent pictures of him and this girl, they’re clearly a couple (there’s an anniversary post from January of this year). On her profile the most recent picture is from just last month. Her Facebook photo is of the two of them, but her instagram photo isn’t. However, she still has at least 4 pictures of the two of them on her instagram profile. 

My question is: doesn’t this seem like this guy is in a relationship? What should I do? My gut is telling me to message this girl and just straight up ask her if they’re still dating.

"I had an argument with my boyfriend because of my birthday present Yesterday for my boyfriend’s birthday, I said that the gift I prepared was a razor gift box, but he was shocked and kept saying that I wasted it. He already had one and it was very important to him. He felt that buying another one was a waste of resources, and he didn’t have two faces. He also said that I kept putting pressure on him as if he was guilty if he didn’t accept my good intentions. He said that I didn’t consider the facts.

"Navigating Dating in 2023 A dating experience I had about two months ago has been sticking with me and is negatively affecting my view of dating today. I think what bothers me about it is what I’m about to share is very a very standard experience for daters in 2023.    

I saw a really cute girl at a restaurant with her friends so I went up with a friend and introduced ourselves. We ended up hitting it off really well and spent the rest of the night drinking, talking, dancing, and kissing. Two nights later I took her out to a nice restaurant for dinner, then to another bar for a drink after. We went back to her place and made out. She wanted to have sex but I decided to hold off as I thought there may be potential for something more than a hook-up because the chemistry was very good and we shared a number of the same hobbies and values (spoiler: I was wrong).    

She came over on a Tuesday evening, I cooked her dinner, we had sex, she spent the night, and we had sex in the morning. That upcoming Friday I was going out of town and she said she had a girls trip planned as well. She texted me heavily the rest of the week and we made plans for the following Wednesday when we were both back in town.    

Over the weekend she posted a few photos, none of which included any other people which I knew was a red flag. If she was on a “girls trip” she would’ve posted pics with friends, or been tagged in pics. I texted her on Monday and she told me she was getting serious with someone else and it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to see each other any more and she apologized three times.    

At the end of the day, it’s not a big deal. We essentially had 3 dates, weren’t exclusive, and I didn’t have strong feelings for her yet. But she clearly lied about the purpose of her trip - she went on a weekend trip with another guy. I guess her plan was to have sex with me, go on a vacation with another guy, and, if it didn’t become more serious, come home and presumably continue having sex with me given we had another date planned.    

Most people on here will say “you weren’t exclusive, she can hookup with whoever she wants.” Sure, I suppose she can, but something tells me her current boyfriend wouldn’t be thrilled to find out she was in someone else’s bed three days before their planned vacation. If that trip didn’t go well I presume she would’ve come home and continued having sex with me and probably not have told me what she really did that weekend.    

From my perspective, I can’t take someone seriously as a potential partner if they’re jumping back and forth from my bed to another guy’s bed in the initial stages of dating. That is a lousy foundation to build a relationship on in my book. Some posters here tell their dates they only sleep with people when they are exclusive, and if that’s a dealbreaker for the date then so be it. My issue with that is, in 2023 I don’t think it’s going to go very well for me to essentially tell women right off the bat they can’t sleep with other people if they want to date me. No one wants to feel like someone they are just getting to know is trying to control their behavior.    

My frustration is that she didn’t break any “rules” of modern dating other than lying about the weekend trip. From this experience, and others, I can’t help but feel that in the courting phase I have to invest my time, money, and energy into a woman who is going to continue sleeping around regardless of how well things are going. This leaves me to feel like I have two options. 1) Stop dating. 2) Accept that any future girlfriend will have slept with other men during the courting phase.

"M22 needs advice on how to start letting intimacy happen M22 yo University Student here.
So I have no experience with intimacy. I have no problem with talking to girls and strangers generally I think people think I am quite charismatic at first so its not some social anxiety thing. I know how to start a convo and I think I am an interesting guy to talk to. But only as long as its not about myself. I will talk to you about Ww2, Aldous Huxley, JWST or the physics behind nuclear fusion. I love good deep conversations about things but just not me. I dont consider my emotions to be valid and important. I dont understand it well when people want to be closer to me. I dont know how to act but I consider myself a pretty confident guy in all other regards. Ive been working out for multiple years and I'm tall so like Im comfortable in my skin as long as the matter on hand arent my emotions.

I never valued intimacy really as I always found emotions a bit annoying and more of a chore than something that makes life fun. It always seemed to me that the girls I was into never were into me. I dont blame them I was a mess for most of my life.

My life changed significantly last year when I moved and found a lot of new friends and people to do things with. I became much better at socialskills and got confident. We go to festivals, parties, raves etc and I'm having a ton of fun. With this naturally comes girls. I noticed that there are quite a few girls in our groups that I think are really attractive. One girl specifically I got closer with a bit recently. I know her via my best friend. I think he dated her at some point but now shes really just part of the friendgroup as my friend has another gf.

I had seen her a few times. She made it pretty obvious I think. Dancing in front of me. Constantly smiling at me. Seeking eye contact. Following me on parties, after hugs letting her hands rest on me. Anyways on a party recently I saw her and we talked and eventually it got late and for some reason she really liked to touch me. Like she wanted to hug me all the time and snuggle next to me. She was quite drunk and I kindof ""looked out for her"" a bit. She said how nice this and and how much she likes my body as its so warm. She is what one would consider ""petite"" and I'm over 10 inches taller than her and 60+ lbs heavier so idk if its weird that I have some ""protect her"" feelings but I know shes been sexually assaulted by strangers before and she is really delicate so like idk. I feel responsible somehow. She definetly enjoyed resting her head on my chest. I think she really likes me and I like her too. At some point when we had to stop hugging as my arm slid off hers out hands met and we held hands and interlocked fingers for what felt like an eternity okay so like Im sure she likes me and I do too. 

Now recently I realised something. I dont know what to do next. Like Ive never been around someone that I like that also likes me back really. Im really bad at showing my feelings and Im known to be ""cold and cynical"" at times. For some reason I dont want to text her. Idk why. Im so afraid of being weird and I just know what its like to be disliked and I reject affection regularly. My family for example I hate it when my mum goes off over how much she loves me. Or even my cats. When they come to me and start purring and jumping on me and laying down and rubbing their heads against me. I feel so undeserving of love generally. I dont want love because it makes no sense but man it feels so good when a girl you like puts her hands on you. Like a wave of warmth that you dont want to let go of.

 I realise how the friendzone works and how it punishes inaction but idk wtf to do. Its not just her. Theres multiple girls that I think like me and I like too but idk wtf to do as it always feels weird and inappropriate for me to be intimate with others idk wtf Im scared of. Like im so scared of how powerful the emotions are and I hate how incompetent I am so I just avoid it. Intimacy is one of those things that I cant just ""prepare for"" like an exam. It only comes with experience and I have none and I hate that. Im competent in physical exercise. Im good in Uni, I read a lot. I think Im at least somewhat educated and can talk about almost anything with people. Im openminded, I like to do drugs occasionally, I love all my friends, Im having fun so like I like my life but im so incredibly inexperienced in this one domain called Intimacy. I think if I had any experience I would end up trying to be competent in that too and be sufficient and capeable. But from my current position idk what to do lol",squarecorner_288,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158ufzh/m22_needs_advice_on_how_to_start_letting_intimacy/,1690250564.0,1.0
"Getting numbers at the Gym? Creepy or not? I (21M) am wondering. Is getting a girls number in the gym, creepy or unsettling for women? 

I usually ONLY go up to a girl in the gym, if we’ve made eye contact &amp; if she’s not in a middle of a set. And it seems like there’s interest already.

"Is he not that into me.....long vent *update I last texted him I couldn't text and if we could talk later...he never responded and has put no further effort....

I've been talking to this guy for a bit. He is out of state for the next few weeks. We are not being intimate or kissing. We just cuddle hold hands and I spend the night sometimes...which I think has led to me having more feelings for him. He says he wants to take things slow and the next person he is intimate with is someone he wants to be in a relationship with and get married to....I honestly don't really talk to anyone else and have also been abstinent for over a year...so to me it is awesome to not have someone pressuring me or feeling like they just want me for one thing... I do struggle with anxiety and sometimes over think on his actions.  He will text me and respond back to me hours or days after. I sent him a message about how I felt this was making me feel. I want to believe he has good intentions but also feel like he's gaslighting me...he took a defense mode stating how I take a long time to respond too and how he understands I'm busy as is he and to not over think it, and please be understanding. He is away for work and stated to ""Realize this because you are going to ruin this before we even have a chance"". He did state he is so overwhelmed and just needs my love and support...


I will add that while he is too busy to respond example once he took 2 days to respond he somehow had time to post 4 pictures and 6 +stories on social media😏 

I feel when we hang out he is so sweet and caring...but texting is so dry and distant.  Am I being to needy in thinking it's rude and giving off not into u vibes by him taking as long as he does to text?",Opposite-Swing6555,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158txyh/is_he_not_that_into_melong_vent/,1690249254.0,0.99

The way she looked at me couldn't keep her eyes off me her body language was also positive she smiled too even said my name.

So I asked another girl who I've known my whole life she said they were pretty close I asked who this person liked and she replied by saying she had a boyfriend. Me being I'm incapable of not telling the truth so i confessed everything. Then this person messaged me say she gave off the wrong impression I've always been good at reading people my intuition has always been spot on about people. 

The guy she's with was in my year when we younger his friends harassed and humiliated me while he stood and watched during that time captain america was great influence on me my friends made aware of how similar we were identical name and later I found out my personality was the same too I just wish she could see the true me I know exactly the type of person I am now I just hope the other guy can be a better person than me.",Luftwaffle-,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158txn4/annoying_situation_24m/,1690249230.0,1.0
"I should have asked my crush for his number I (17f) and my crush (17m) went to a sports camp last week where people from around my city can practice sports together for one week. On the first day I noticed this really cute looking guy, let’s call him X. X was being very kind the whole camp so I thought to ask for his number before the camp ended. I was going to ask for his NUMBER on Tuesday, one day before the whole practice thing would be over. When Tuesday finally came, I got too nervous to ask him for anything so I just thought it would be better to do it the next day so incase he rejects me, it wouldn’t matter. Well Friday rolled around and after practice was over, I got nervous again but sucked it up and asked, the only problem was is that I asked for his Snap and not his number out of anxiety. I got his Snap but after, I realized he’s never on it, so we wouldn’t be able to ever talk. I regret not asking for his number instead because he probably would have given it to me, but we do share the same sports coach for private lessons. I’m thinking of asking my coach if X will ever do another lesson so I could go, or just asking my coach straight out for X’s number, but would that be too much? I don’t know if I should just let this go or ask anything from my coach.

"Dating a massage therapist I'm (25m)not sure if I'm alright with being with a woman(24f) who is a massage therapist.

I have been dating a nearly perfect woman. She has a wonderful personality, she's kind, attractive, makes me feel great just interacting with her, I have had good interactions with her family and she with mine. We both haven't slept with anyone because we are waiting for marriage, however, we have kissed a lot and been physical. She doesn't yell or escalate arguments, which I really love about her. I really like her but I just don't like the idea of her touching strangers on a regular basis, mostly because she is a massage therapist. I know it's stupid to take it so seriously but I really do think of physical touch as being something special. She has said so too. I'm going to bring this topic up with her tomorrow while trying to be a gentle as I can so I don't upset her. The last thing I want is to make her cry over something like this. She is a sensitive person as I've noticed interacting with her, it's another reason I like her so much. 

I'm having a hard time with this because I've been considering my future with this woman. It's just hard to think of her massaging other people. I know it's a health profession but I don't know. Am I being too unreasonable? I do plan to bring this up with her, any suggestions on how to do so without upsetting her? She's been very honest with me but I can tell she is very sensitive so I really don't want to make her feel awful just because of her work. It's not like she is doing anything wrong, it's just my own maybe you could call it jealousy. It's hard for me to think of her touching other men. 

She's told me she doesn't want to change me. I don't want to change her either, she really is so great. I just don't know if I can take thinking about her touching other men on a regular basis. I especially don't want to hurt her by saying something stupid about what is just a job. I really don't know what to do.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I wrong for thinking this way?",Ok-Cartoonist-5379,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158thrb/dating_a_massage_therapist/,1690248098.0,1.0
"He wants a bj on the first date and wants me to provide condoms for him is it even worth going? He wants a blowjob on the first date. I’m not sure if I want that . Then he wants me to provide condoms and every chance he can get he never goes to get any . Should I even do this ? He’s like can you stop and get some and then he wants a specific kind. Then why not get them yourself? He’s like I wanna show you off he’s 40 and I’m 21. He says he doesn’t look at age but is really proud to show me off to all his friends and people he plays golf with. He’s like he and his ex wife never used condoms but since I’m not on birth control I told him it was a must that we use them. He agreed because he said he didn’t want to make any babies right now. He wants the ones that are thin and feel like you’re wearing nothing their like almost 10 bucks at the store so you could at least buy them. He makes it seem like he wants to treat me good. I can’t tell if it’s because he actually does or if it’s because I’m young that he wants to show me off to his friends.

The thing is we’re finally meeting first time we were supposed to meet he wanted me to come over at 11pm. I set boundaries and told him I wouldn’t be coming over because coming to his house is extremely intimate. But a blowjob is even more intimate. He told me basically his wife cheated on him. They’ve been divorced for 2 years . During the 2 years of them not being together he claims to haven’t had sex . Even if that is true I find it hard to believe with how high his sex drive seems to be. He’s told me he wants a relationship with me and he really likes me. He said he only wants to have sex with me. At first he said he’d buy them and we could leave a pack in his car just in case we have sex.  Then all of sudden he was on the road seeing his parents in his hometown and didn’t think to stop. Now it’s left up to me to get them. Which I told him I’d rather him get them because I’m not sure what kind he likes he sent me the ones he likes saying he wants it to feel like he’s wearing nothing because he doesn’t want to wear a condom at all.

"Conventionally pretty vs Average For reference I'm a 22 (M) about 5'8 195lbs. Built like Mark Wahlberg without a full on 6 pack and often get compared to Cuba Gooding Jr (mostly) and Will Smith for looks.

My friends often say I don't date or go out with or sleep with the prettiest women. Not that they're ugly but cute and average. Whenever I am talking to or meet an extremely attractive girl they almost celebrate it. Basically saying I need to have better standards. In my little dating experience since dating my ex of almost 5 years (14-19) I have found that the more average looking girl either, treat me better, are nicer, and generally more pleasant to be around. Don't get me wrong either conveniently or not can still be shitty people. But I find it interesting.

What have y'all's experiences been like? Lately all the extremely pretty ones are either crazy, rude, or boring 🤣.
