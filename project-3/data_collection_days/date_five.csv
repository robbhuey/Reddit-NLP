"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",SyCams,5487,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/es2cek/rdating_is_not_the_place_to_soapbox/,1579646134.0,0.98
"Didn't kiss on the third date and now she dumped me. Any advice/feedback? So, I am a 29 year old male resident physician. I have not been on a date in a very long time. So, you could say I am a little inexperienced. I am 5' 11"" go to the gym on regular basis and try to stay healthy. Anyways, I met this girl on hinge. First day was great. we got to know eachother a little. Had two drinks. Hugged her goodbye and we parted away. We met briefly the week after for coffee and walked around. I asked her if she wanted to continue to see me, and she said yes but wanted to take things slow.  I was totally ok with that. Btw I was planning everything. I text her regularly and asking about her dates, etc. I took her to a nice resturant, we walked around after and took a picture together. I wanted to kiss her at that point, but I wasn't sure because ""she wanted to take things slow"". She texted me that night saying she had a great time and loved the pic of us together. After that day, I always initiated texts but she would take hours to respond (I understand we are both in a very demanding profession). Then, she texted me saying that she is not ready for anything serious now and she does not want to lead me on. I told her I respect your decision, and wished her luck. I am not going to lie, this dating game sucks. I don't if I did anything wrong here.

"We finally kissed after 5 dates. Am I being hasty if I walk away after she said she’s processing things? I (M23) have been seeing this girl (F22) for a few weeks now (met on Bumble), and we’ve been on 5 dates. Chemistry was there instantly, but she wanted to take things slow on date 2. I was okay with this. On date 3, I asked her what going slow looked like, which spiraled into her saying she’s not 100% if she’s ready for a relationship, but that she is dating to see. 

Fast forward to date 5, I asked her if she still liked the pace we were going at, which spurred another conversation about dating goals. We talked for hours about what we want. Suffice to say, we both agree we want to continue seeing each other, but she feels like she’d be leading me on if she’s not 100% sure what her long-term goal is. She says she could very well see a relationship come out of this, however. She admitted she’d been on a few other dates, none of which made it past date 1. She reassured me that there is a reason I made it to date 5 and no other guys made it to date 2. But she even said she’d be okay if I went on other dates. 

After we had that talk, we kept talking and returned to our normal conversations. Things got intimate, we started holding hands, and then we kissed. She admitted that was the first time she kissed someone in almost 3 years (and again I’m the first guys she’s been on several dates with in that same time). I feel like the kiss has complicated her feelings further. She texted me that she’s still processing everything, and I’m not sure what to make of it. I left the ball in her court by saying to take her time since I’m okay with going slow. But now I’m thinking I should just walk away and cut it off, but I don’t know if that’s too irrational. Perhaps I should give her some time and space to figure it out it.

TL;DR: We finally kissed after 5 dates. The kiss happened after we had lengthy talks about dating goals. We both ideally want a serious relationship, but I’m definitely more ready than she is, as she’s unsure if she’s even ready to go down that path. I’m fine with taking it slow still. What do I make of this? I left the ball in her court. Perhaps she’s not into me, but I feel like me being the first guy she’s kissed and been on several dates in 3 years with has to count for something. She said she’s processing what happened,  but I may just walk away now. I’m unsure if not waiting for a response from her is too hasty, but I do want someone who is certain about me and what I have to offer.",-Leethul-,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fb6qy/we_finally_kissed_after_5_dates_am_i_being_hasty/,1690892925.0,0.92
"I went with my gut and ended it – but did I overreact? So I’ve (24M) been talking to this girl (23F) for about 3-4 weeks now and decided to cut things off..here are the things I noticed along the way:

•I initially tried to set up a date for us by getting an idea of her availability and she just never gave a straight answer. However, she did let me know that she would go out for pickup soccer and would invite me out to play. And these invitations were kinda like “This is where I’ll be if you want to come,” not like a “Let’s do this together” invitation. 

•we went to the mall to pick out an outfit for her to wear to a concert (I did not pay, btw). By the time we were finished, I said that I was hungry and was gonna head to a restaurant to grab some food. She followed me there and we got our food. When we got outside, I found some tables for us and she said “Oh, you wanted to eat?” This was confusing to me. I figured if you came all the way and got food with me that we’d eat together. After we sat down, she was glued to her phone, the communication was dry, and she hardly touched her food. She eventually apologized for being so distracted and mentioned that she was thinking of a guy she had previously ended things with who was moving away. I came to the conclusion that I was the rebound and stood up to leave. She stopped me, saying that’s not the case and that she wants a relationship, but she needs time. I held onto my skepticism and still decided to see how it went.

•From there, nothing really changed. I initiated most of our conversations. I found myself double-texting. Sometimes I’d get responses the next day like I wasn’t just ghosted the day before.

She went on a trip recently and hadn’t said anything to me the whole time. I just brushed it off as her wanting to focus on her vacay. I did speak to her once she got back and it was more of the same. Dry, one-word responses.

I finally said enough is enough and called it off, explaining that it felt like things were one-sided in both effort and communication. She said I was quick to judge and I told her she wasn’t quick to show me otherwise. Did I overreact? Did I not give things enough time?

"I really like this guy at work that's 35 years old, but he said he's never had a girlfriend. There's a guy at work that I really like and has himself together. He's told me that he bought a house 5 years ago and moved in his mother and two younger sisters. I asked him why and he said so they would have the opportunity to save money since his mother and sister were always broke growing up. One of his sisters is also 11 years old from a different father and said one of the reasons he moved them in was so that his 11 year old sister could have her own room. I asked him what about dating and girlfriends and he says that he's never had a girlfriend. When I asked why, he said he was always more stressed about being poor growing up, but when he started making good money in his late 20's and bought his house at 31, he is a lot more open to a girlfriend, but now he's trying to buy a house for his mother.  

His sister however is a strange case because he said she's only a couple of years younger than he is and even though she gives him money for rent (He says he doesn't charge his mother rent), she doesn't have a job and hasn't worked in years. He did say she is doing coding classes from home but says she has been doing that for years. I know I was wrong to ask, but I asked him if she was disabled and he said she is not and is just a normal girl.  
So what's the deal with this guy? He's very sweet and respectful and keeps to himself for the most part. I know living with your parents is common in different countries, but he is an American born black guy.

"My generation just adopted the dumbest behavior in dating I hate how in my (27M) generation it became normalized and accepted to leave someone hanging in the middle of the conversation for day(s).

I am talking with 5 different women and all reply after a day. I am honestly starting to lose interest in people like them and see it as a red flag. It usually goes in two ways:

1. They remain ""interested"" and even if we have a date my expectations are on the floor. We cover super basic questions which we could have covered in text or usually on my profile, I leave after 30 mins. just to receive texts about when could we meet again. The first impression you made was that I am last on your priorities list and then didn't bother to look up 1 thing about me on my profile. Like hell no.
2. Even worse if they are not interested anymore but I still am. Then they just disappear leaving me to figure out if I said smth wrong, if they are busy, if I should text them again, etc. I did nothing wrong to them, why do people think leaving the other in this limbo is okay? If you cannot copy and paste a text of ""I am not feeling it"" then just unmatch ffs.

I am not joking, I have never been rejected in my life, well I have never been rejected properly!

I am done listening to this bs of ""they don't owe me anything"". Well, it seems like they did owe me a whole day of frustration in the end, which I didn't deserve, so what's up with that?

Before anyone says I shouldn't get attached to them, I get it, truly. However, as a guy, 99% of the time I put in all the effort to find things I like about them to ask interesting questions and guess what...I start liking them!

I truly don't get why they put the long-term relationship flair if their mentality is ""we will see how it is going"" and not the ""I want to get to know this guy to see if it would work or not""?

Asked out a girl and she said “I’ll think about it” Today I finally summoned enough courage to ask this girl out who I see in the cafeteria at my job on a daily basis. I just kept it simple and asked her if she would like to get a cup of coffee sometime and I even put it out there that there’s no pressure to say yes. She said that she would think about it. I would’ve preferred a direct yes or no answer because now I’m unsure how to take that answer. Was her saying “I’ll think about it” just her being nice and in reality she’s not interested or will she genuinely think about it?

"My ex-GF(34F) refuses to tell her male roomie that I(25M) am in a relationship with her. Was I wrong for breaking up? The girl I've been dating long-distance for a couple of months refuses to tell her male roomie that we are together, and I decided to break up over it. Was I wrong?

  
This all started months ago when she told me the story about him. A couple of years ago, after a breakup, she decided to move in with a guy she knew was interested and she hoped it could work out. He turned out to be very weird and she didn't want to start a relationship with him after all, but she had to keep living with him because she couldn't find a new place to stay. Either it was really shitty or super expensive. They've been living together for 3 years. I accepted it and thought nothing of it. She has told me he is an incredibly jealous person who becomes angry over the smallest things, thus she could not tell him we were together. She said she would find a new place to stay, and then tell him.  


  
We are dating long distance, and this week she had planned to go on a trip with him to my country. This was planned before we got together.We only see each other once a month, and I thought it would be nice to be able to see each other. I suggest we could meetup, but she said it would be impossible to meet without the guy. He described him as so dependent that he would follow her everywhere. She couldn't even go for an evening walk without him joining. I then suggested we meet with the guy and just pretend to be friends, so that I could get to atleast see her. She said that was a cute idea and I went along with.

  
Until the date came closer and I started feeling really shitty about it.... why do I have to pretend to a random roomie that we are not together? How angry can he possibly become so as to hide our relationship from him, but at the same time she goes on holiday with him for multiple weeks?

  
A couple days before we would meet I told her I feel frustrated about the situation and I have no idea why this has to happen. She said she is frustrated too, and that it feels weird from the outside, but now it is too late. She has lied to him about where we had met, and lied to him continuously in the past when she went on trips to my place. She would for example say that she was visiting family in her home country, and then fly over to my country instead.

  
The date came and I started telling my friends about the situation. Everyone around me has described this as a massive red flag. When she landed I told her we have to talk, and I asked her if she is together with the guy or what is going on. I got a crying voice message in response where she told me I had basically ruined her whole holiday in a matter of seconds. She had always been honest with me about him, and she couldn't believe I accused her of cheating and lying. I said my question was never intended to hurt her, but this whole situation is extremely weird and I can't comprehend it. I need clarification.

  
She said that this is my issue, not hers. That I have issues and my insecurities are messing with my mind. Suddenly confronting her and ""exploding"" on her was exactly what she grew up with and she can't be with someone who triggers all her trauma like that. I again said that it was never my intention to be mean, but my mind changed about pretending we were friends, and the whole thing felt crappy.

  
I started talking more and more to people around me, and everyone keeps saying I am borderline being manipulated and that these are huge red flags over and over. My mind feels like mud. I have no idea if I am at fault or if I did anything wrong.  


  
After some thinking, I decided to end things. I told her that even if she was together with the guy or not, to be called an insecure, problematic person she can't help by bringing up such a question is extremely over the line and I will not allow someone to treat me that way. I blocked her on social media and said she could reach out to me by mail.  


  
After I blocked her I got a super long message from her best friend trying to explain the situation. She said that the guy is an incredibly jealous person, who she has gone on holiday with multiple times and known for several years. He would become jealous over the smallest of things, and if my ex upset her, he would be impossible to live with. The best-friend told me it was not fair to treat my ex this way.

  
My mind feels so incredibly torn over this. On the one hand, I think most people would find this situation extremely weird. Traveling on a mulitple week holiday with an ""emotional tyrant"" who cannot know about us, and who is hell to live with. On the other hand, I can see how I shouldn't have confronted her so directly right before meeting me, but was it really such a harsh question to ask?",ThrowRA_RoomieDoomie,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fbvg5/my_exgf34f_refuses_to_tell_her_male_roomie_that/,1690894646.0,0.85

"How do I break up with my boyfriend So my boyfriend and I have gone through rough patches together, but he’s just not the same after it. He seems depressed but keeps denying it, he says he feels nothing, he won’t care much if we break up, if I died, if he died, etc. but he does want to be together and he does love me too. 

I want to stay with him because I want to help him get better and happier and I can’t just leave him alone while feeling like this, but it’s just so hard on me too to hear him saying all these things, because I literally care about him more than I do myself and he couldn’t give 2 shits if we never talked again, so that hurts. I’ve tried to break up with him but I can’t get myself to say the words, I can’t leave him while he’s feeling like this and I have hope it’ll get better.

"I was happier when I believed I would be alone forever Now that I have that little bit of hope, I’ve opened myself up to constant rejection and pain. 

This process of having to relearn again that I not only am probably going to end up alone and sad, but that I in fact deserve it too, is excruciating. 

Why am I alone? I am decidedly an unviable sexual and romantic partner. First of all because when I was a teenager I had a problem with self harm. Cutting yourself is about the least masculine thing you can do. Even if I stopped 10 years ago, it doesn’t matter to the people looking at me. I’ve recently tried to cover them with tattoos but they are still visible. Before that I just didn’t wear short sleeves or go swimming for an entire year. Maybe we go back to that to avoid the questions. 

Secondly, I lack typical masculine features. I don’t grow chest hair or really much hair on my legs at all. I can’t grow a beard. My voice is disgustingly high pitched. It’s like a squeaky toy going through a cheese grater. People often assume I am gay. None of this isn’t going to change either. I’m 25. 

I don’t have the genetics to get some insane physique either, so even though I destroy myself in the gym, I can’t seem to build any visible muscle and still look pretty underwhelming. 

I get that this is a confidence thing. You can make up for a lot by being confident. How the fuck can I be confident when I have zero good qualities? How can I believe that I deserve to be with someone when I know they can do infinitely better? I like them, clearly I want them to be happy. Why would I want them to be with me? Thats not their best life and sounds miserable.

"I (M32) feel uneasy about getting back into OLD as I’m feeling more insecure/unattracrive I started using tinder in in 2020, and for a year + or so I went on a lot of dates, like a lot. No struggles getting dates but it went just ok, a lot of 1st dates and some second dates, and the occasional 3rd date. 
 I felt more or less confident and I had no issues getting matches at all. I had pretty good photos, probably too good as I picked the best ones of me, which were a little too good compared to irl. Some were 2-3 years old. 

Fast forward to today, I have removed or replaced most of the photos to more recent ones. Photos that are ok but probably not as attractive as the previous ones, and I can tell it’s a lot harder to get matches for the past few months. Dating on the apps is really superficial, I’m aware of it and it sucks. Doubly so as I also want to date someone I find attractive.

The reality now is that I’m balding and it obviously changes a lot in term of looks. I’m not feeling very confident about my looks anymore and I don’t know how to tackle it. I’m not really living up to how I used to look anymore. Definitely feel like my looks faded.

"When and how it is acceptable to ask about your partner's previous relationships and sexual history? Probably a controversial topic, let me explain.  
  
I \[27M\] have a religius background, but I have not been religious at all since I was about 16, I would define myself as an atheist at the moment. Although I am no longer religious, my upbringing had a strong influence on my values. I have been only in 3 long time relationships and only had sex with these three girl. I did not participate in hookup culture at all, 0 one night stand, 0 fwb. Sex is something that for me involves a lot of emotions and I need to feel connecion and trust.  
  
As I hold and have lived by these views, I would look for the same in my future partner, but I don't know how and when to ask. Many people get offended if I ask anything about their past at the beginning, but I think it's something that should be discussed early enough so we don't waste each other time and don't hurt eachother.  
  
This is not about numbers. If she had 10 1 year long realationship and had sex with all 10 is perfectly fine for me, but if she had 2 one night stands or fwb it's a turn off for me.  
  
I honestly don't want to judge anyone. It's perfectly fine if someone has different views on this. I know many people will probably disagree with me, but these are my preferences, and I need advice on when and how to bring this up without offending others and to find out if we share the same views.

She said something small to upset me and I got scared and cut all contact. It was this as well as the fact that she has ADHD. I know this is a really dumb reason; I’m autistic and I attract people who are like me

The thing is, I was abused by someone with adhd. They who used their issues with object permanence (or emotional permanence I’m not really sure of the right term) to harm me. Basically, since they knew I have abandonment trauma from a parent and developed issues around that, repeatedly told me that I am disposable to them. That they don’t think about me at all when I’m not around. So out of fear of this, I avoid people who have adhd

This has happened to me twice, at 2 different moments in my life…

The quick little backstory, I messed around with both guys (not at the same time) and we werent exclusive because it’s just not what I was looking for at the time. They didn’t say it to get in my pants because we were already messing around. Months after messing around they’ve brought marriage up. I make pretty good money and they both know it. One of them makes more than me but started talking about getting married once I actually got the money making job, haha. So it felt like convenience in a way, but at the same time it didn’t since he already made a lot of money. The other one makes decent money and I’ve been knowing/messing around with for a while on and off. And he said that since we’ve been messing with each other for so long it’s like we’re already in a relationship. LIKE WHAT!? What am I missing here? why would someone bring up marriage without being exclusive intentionally ? Maybe they don’t want to consider dating unless we both go into it with marriage in mind? 

I didn’t think about the whole marriage proposals back then because I didn’t want something serious but now that I actually want a serious relationship, not exactly looking for marriage, but I do want to settle down with someone, this comes to mind a lot. And I’m trying to make sense of it. I’ve dated men I like after them and didn’t sleep with them cause I wanted to take things slow and not give it up unless we’re exclusive. And it feels like it backfired because it hasn’t worked out. Do I have to sleep with men for them to want to be exclusive!? I thought exclusivity first then sex, maybe there isn’t a right order, every situation is different. Like now that I’m trying to do things in the right order, things aren’t working out for me?

"conflict arising when an introvert dates and extrovert...off my chest, and advice? I was gonna post this in AITA but I felt like I am the AH..so now I am mainly venting and looking for insights and advice

  
I've been dating this guy (P) for 4 months and it was his birthday this past Sunday. We went to a nearby town with his friends who I had not met before. There were 12 of us. Now I am an introvert and social interactions really drain me, especially with people that I don't know. I kinda despise small talks as well. It's not that I am antisocial; I can be quite social, needing to see people almost everyday and love talking to people, but in small dosage like 3-4 hours, and with close friends. Therefore, after a few hours on this trip I was just absolutely drained. P on the other hand loves socialising and gets on with everyone (which is one of the things I appreciate about him).

  
On this occasion, because there were so many of us. Everywhere we went we had to split into different tables. Throughout larger part of the day, I felt like he was not paying attention to me at all, he always ended up on a different table, or a different group, wherever we went, so I was feeling quite anxious, because I felt like I had to make conversations with his friends for hours on end and he was off catching up with his friends, bouncing from group to group. I tried hard to rationalise it as I understood it was his birthday and he had to catch up with his friends, some of whom he might not have seen in ages. But as the day went on, I couldn't help but felt more and more, for a lack of better word, ""neglected"". My rational mind tells me I shouldn't feel this way as I know he was there for me and he was just there with his friend, but the emotional part of my brain was just screaming, ""why can't he even pay some attention to me, or sit with me for a while"". I felt like I was just thrown into the deep end (socialising with strangers) without an anchor (him). There was a point where the group went to laser tag, and we had to split into different teams, his friends teamed up by themselves and said this way me and him could be on the same team. I was standing next to him, when he went straight to team up with other people leaving me behind without even talking to me or looking at me. I was really fighting an internal battle because on one hand, I felt like a massive selfish, needy AH who needed so much attention and wouldn't socialise with his friends, on his birthday no less, and also kinda a failure for not being able to socialise with his friends and be a good partner in front of his friends that he can be proud of; I know rationally he didn't mean to make me feel any of this, he was just too excited to see his friends. On the other hand, I felt like I couldn't help how I felt, and it was an overwhelming situation for an introvert like me, like sensory overload, and I felt I wasn't getting any support / acknowledgement from him.

  
After about 6 hours into the trip, at 3pm, I was already drained and kinda didn't want to talk to anyone. On top of that, I received an email saying I had been rejected by a job I really wanted. This was when he noticed me having a bad mood and asked me what was wrong, and whether I was enjoying. I replied that I was struggling to have fun, and I was tired and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I really regretted my tone right when I said it. Also I didn't tell him about the job thing because maybe I felt it was irrelevant, or I was embarrassed, but it definitely contributed to my low mood. He went suddenly quiet and I knew he was upset. But I asked him to tell me what he was thinking, he just told me he wanted me to have a good time.

  
We went on to do the activities planned for the rest of the day. It was good time tbh. I think he consciously tried to pay more attention to me, so when the 12 of us split into two tables for dinner, we ended up sitting next to each other, and then also on the train back to the town where we live.  
Once his friends left and we were alone though, it was obvious that there was something in the air, because neither of us talked about the trip at all, nor did we debrief on meeting his friends for the first time. Well, we went straight to bed. The next day I picked a time and asked him whether he had been upset with me. He said he wasn't so much upset with me as he wanted me to have a good time and felt responsible for it if I didn't. I told him social interactions just overwhelmed me after a while and it was a lot for me. And most importantly, I felt like for the first 6 hours of the trip we hardly spoke. I hardly saw him / interacted with him. He said it wasn't true (I concede he might have had a different perspective? but I really thought what I thought). I explained that even when I was at a festival the day before the trip with my friends, I still had to go off and be alone for a while because it was getting too much, and that was with MY friends, this time I had to make a lot of esoteric conversations with 10 people I just met, it was just too much. He went sometimes it just had to be that way, that we had to make conversations, and we couldn't just not hang out with others ever, which I actually agreed. I did end up telling him about the job, which he understood.

  
That was two days ago, we moved on, but for the past two days I felt like shit, because I felt like I ruined his birthday, we were so looking forward to it, but now he will remember not feeling good after I said I wasn't having a good time. I hate that I contributed to that. I also feel conflicted because I don't know what I could have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same thing happening again, because I know what I know logically, I tried on the trip to rationalise and lay out the facts in front of my eyes (that he was just too excited to see his friends, that he wasn't ignoring me, that it's normal to have to socialise in that way), but I still felt the negative emotions at that moment. Honestly, I feel like I failed. I knew the facts, I knew I should have been better, but I couldn't. And knowing that his friends are so important to him, I just hope it hasn't put a damper on what we have going forward. The only solace is that I don't think his friends would have been aware of my internal struggle; I did talk to them normally and they probably just thought I was someone that are quieter than the average person. Honestly they are all super nice people and I would love to hang out with them again.

  
I always believe it's good to compromise / communicate / find a solution. But when we tried to find a solution to this, we were both stumped. As I said, not sure what I should have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same happening again.

I operate well in group settings and have a circle of friends, but I have never been comfortable with taking social risks or initiating conversations. As a result of this, I’ve spent the vast majority of my spare time alone. There are several social experiences that I feel pretty insecure about not having done, like ordering from a bar or going to a real party, but anything relating to dating and romance is by far my biggest insecurity. I’ve never even held someone’s hand, let alone gone on a date or kissed, and I feel that my understanding of how relationships actually work is very naïve and influenced by movies and TV. 

I know that I will need to put myself out there and get into uncomfortable situations to improve my social skills. I’m wondering, though, if I should work myself up to dating by doing other things with friends, or if I should try finding dates right away to gain some experience. I think it would be helpful to get a better sense of myself and understand how to navigate more social situations first, but I also suspect that my lack of romantic experience is only going to become a bigger red flag as time goes on. 

Any thoughts, advice or perspective on this would be most appreciated!",blacklabradoodle,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15flyn7/should_i_work_on_social_skills_before_dating/,1690917551.0,1.0

"23M bi-curious, don't know what to do! So one thing is sure I am into women but lately I have noticed I feel attracted to guys of my physique(lean athletic) who don't show feminine traits. I live in a bit conservative society so can't talk about this to anyone. I am not that into dating apps and even I am scared if someone gets to know about me trying to date guys.

I would love to talk to anyone who shares a similar trait, maybe here I could explore at least virtually.

"How do you actually meet people these days? I have no clue how to meet new women or at the very least I have no idea how to approach them. I live in a small town and people and almost all people here have developed some kind of trust issues. You litteraly can’t approach somebody without being percieved as a creep. I have tried messaging girls but either I don’t even get a “seen”, get very short and boring replies that I have no idea how to follow up on, get replies but I can smell that they are either shy or mistrusting from the get go so the conversation is going nowhere, or once in a blue moon get a good conversation going but still get rejected for whatever reason.

For example, I messages a girl, we hit it off great, we went on two dates, albeit 2 days apart from each other, we had a blast both times, but the next day according to her words, she thought that we should stop communicating because past unresolved problems from her last relationship that lasted 7 years according to her words and she hasn’t quite healed from them, that I was “too mature” for her(again her words), that things were proceeding too fast. Mind you, I live in a very conservative city, so hookup culture isn’t as prevalent so we never had sex or anything of that sort, we didn’t even kiss, but her choice and I didn’t wanna push needlessly. Anyway, I was still baffled by her decision. I decided not to push because I think it would make me look pathetic if I tried to convince her to give us a try so I just accepted it and moved on.

So, what do I do? Should I just give up and just accept that I can’t do anything about it and wait for a miracle to happen and just maybe the woman that is for me will appear out od nowhere or does anyone have advice, because I am at a loss here.",AdamDrake21,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15frmch/how_do_you_actually_meet_people_these_days/,1690930650.0,1.0
"Confused Hello all! I just started seeing this guy. My stomach fills with excitement thinking of him. Can’t wait to see him again. It feels crazy, it’s so easy to make plans that are literally months out. I feel confident/secure with him. I am always so hung up on if he likes me, does he want to be with me. I have done some work recognizing those feelings. And I was always afraid to text first, I just don’t have that anxiety with him. I can text him whatever whenever. I can share deep thoughts and not feel he’s judging me. It just feels like we have known each other and natural.

My hang up- I think he’s cute. I think I’m sexually attracted to him. I say think because I haven’t had sex in 5 years. He is awakening those feelings. I definitely didn’t have these sexual feelings before on one night stands or even past relationships. What I’m feeling right now. But I am overthinking this part: is it because I haven’t had sex in so long- that I am just excited or is it him? I can picture sex with him and all the things I want to do and want him to do. 

I am scared of what if this works out? I’m scared of being hurt. But I want to be with him. Picturing future things with him and it scares but excites me. I want to know more about him. 

I worry I’m not attracted to him enough, I think he’s cute. But I think he deserves more from me. I think as time goes on I become more attracted to him. But is that fair to him? I know things don’t just all happen at once. It’s also very early in our relationship. We haven’t had sex, met any friends or family.

"How would you react if an attractive girl reached out to you like this? So recently, someone I (F23) went to high school with crossed my mind. We had mutual friends but we never spoke I don’t think. I always had the biggest crush on him (M23/24). I ended up switching to an arts school for sophomore-senior year. 3 years ago I deleted all of my social media and I’m pretty sure we had followed each other on Instagram (we never messaged or anything). I don’t really know if he’d even like remember me now? I know he still lives in my city and I really would like to reach out to him. If I still had social media this would obviously be a lot easier but now I don’t know how I’ll ever contact him. I can’t deny that I have done some creeping on his social media accounts from my friend’s so it’s confirmed that he is single and still lives and works in my city. He seems super cool and I think we’d have a lot in common. How in the world do I run into him/contact him?

Would it be absolutely insane to make an Instagram account just to DM him so he can put a face to a name and say something like, “Hey, I don’t know if you remember me but we went to high school together and I randomly thought of you so I thought I’d reach out….”.

"40M and 34F Is he interested or did he lose interest There's this guy (M40) who is my biggest hype guy on IG...you know ❤️🔥 and replies to my (F34) stories from time to time. We've been IG friends for many of months. He's asked me out a lot of times, but we're both busy and never got to meet. Then we finally had a date in a different country cos it happened that we're in the same area at the same time. Date went well. He placed food on my plate, asked me to teach him my hobby, curious about all my activities. There was a lot of interest during my date. I told him I have some work and will need to go home at a certain hour. Then he asked to do something after the food and we had some touristic activities together until it's time for me to go home. The date lasted for around 5 hours. When it was time to go home, he asked me to tell him when I'm back in our country where we are based cos he'd be home sooner than me. It's been 3 weeks since our date and I'll go home next week. He usually never misses a story before we met -- probably just 4 times in the whole 6 months of being IG friends. But he has not viewed my stories 2 times in just 3 weeks. I post almost daily. So did he lose the big interest he had? Also, if there's real interest, shouldn't he be chatting me up even while I'm away and not wait for a second face to face date when I'm home? Or maybe the guy is waiting for me to go home?

"I stopped talking to him for 6 months but he hmu and... Ok so I've searched and searched on Google but I couldn't find anything relating specifically to my situation. Forewarning, This Is a Long Post. Ok so when I first moved to my new town, I (28f) ran into a guy (31m). We made small talk and then he surprised me by asking for my number. It started with him texting me constantly and always asking to hang out. I wouldn't respond much because I wasn't into him like that and I found it a bit overwhelming. at the time I didn't attribute this to anything romantic but as I started responding more and hanging out with him he revealed that he liked me. I told him I liked him as a friend and the next time we hung out he asked me to be his gf. I told him no but I liked our friendship so I still hung out with him.
He started to reveal personal things to me, like for instance how he had proposed to a girl in the past and she messed him over. 

Anyway I had been turning down his requests for me to come over and I told him I wasn't trying to get physical yet. But after a few more hang outs I let him miss me and that sparked something and we had sex. It was pretty nice, nice enough for me to change how I viewed him. He was also kind and generous with me. Again I have a hard time seeing romantic interest from men and I figured it was just a sec thing. So I always expected him to disappear. 

Next, he told me something that I found to be unforgivable at the time and I immediately told him we could no longer hang out. He kept texting me daily and I would ignore him. I would also see him around town and I would avoid him and not talk. I honestly felt like he could be a stalker but he never took it that far. 

Well after 4 months of not talking I heard through our social circle that he was moving to another state. So I sighed a breath of relief. Two months later I get another message from him and I decide to respond. Honestly from my post history you can see that I've been feeling low. But I also hold myself to a high standard and refuse to be with anyone just for the sake of being with someone. (I'm trying to wrap this up, I didn't realize I felt so deeply about this.) 

So we arranged a meet up and the connection was instant. We slept together again and it was better than I'd remembered. We spent the evening together and made plans to see each other soon. We ended up spending the weekend together and had an amazing time. The sex got even better and we found a lot of similar interests. I forgot to preface this by saying that his first language is Spanish and there's kind of language barrier but as I'm trying to learn Spanish it works out great. 

So the question i have is, what is happening here? I can't make sense of my newfound feelings for him and he's also not asking me to be his gf this time around. What does this mean? Also why didn't he let me go after 6 months of me not speaking to him. What was he holding on to. Any anecdotes, personal advice or stories would be great to hear. Thanks in advance.

"Guy didn't look like his pictures. Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great.

"Bad luck or my fault? I've begun to really wrestle with the philosophy of bad luck vs my own inadequacies the last couple years because of my story; Basically I had a first relationship that lasted 5 and a half years starting at the end of my teens and I believe a lot of its longevity was down to my work ethic and ability to know what a girl requires and treat her right (until I decided that I wanted to try something different, maybe a huge mistake on my part) so I have a self assurance/confidence about my ability to maintain a relationship. 

But in the 4 years since it has trying to find a new relationship that has alluded me. I went to university and devoted most of my efforts into being as social as possible - especially for the first year I became known as the social, charismatic guy in my circles and knew a pretty insane amount of people tbh, like on friendly terms with a lot. Important to mention due to my university about 80 percent of these people were girls so you probably wouldn't imagine that I've barely had 2 non substantial shows of interest (that never went anywhere) from girls romantically in those 4 years. It's led me to question where I'm going wrong, like 'is it my looks' (even though before I always considered myself to be average to kinda decent with good style etc) or is it actually luck that has been the major factor I've been missing.

"Am I (17F) wrong for ending the relationship(16M) because of my preference? TL;DR: Guy I used to date would lust over other women and tried to hit up my friend. I blocked him without an explanation. am i wrong?


A while ago, this guy from my school texted me on Instagram complimenting me and basically hinting that I was attractive. He told me he noticed me in the cafeteria everyday, and that from day one he was too afraid to approach me. Well that’s when I made my move and the conversation started to spark from there. Every time someone shows interest in me, I tend to check their following just to see who they’re mutuals with or out of curiosity. 


I noticed that this guy followed a lot of insta models and very pretty local girls that went to my school. I tend to find this common within guys so I basically let it slide since we weren’t really in a relationship. Well, like a week later he asked me out and i accepted, still aware of his following but not really taking it to heart. It was nice, we did things together and hung out after school. However, after a month it kinda started to bother me, especially considering the fact that he liked photos from several models that recently posted within a day. I tried not to take it personal, but it was after he kept telling me I was the only girl he had his eyes set for, that really triggered me in a sense. Like I really don’t care about men masturbating to porn, but lusting over women that didn’t look anything like me is depressing. And yet when I would talk to him about certain guys I found attractive just to be even, he got highly upset with me. He was even in my friend’s messages, calling her attractive and never let her know he was in a relationship.

After that, I basically blocked him without having him explain himself because we have had conversations about this in the past, and he told me “just because i follow girls doesn’t mean you have to break up with me”; I gave him several chances after that but it just kept getting worse. He would try and hide his phone from me even though he literally asked for my account, he moved every girl he talked to into General on insta, and he would even like local girls bikini pics.

From that point I deleted social media to try and heal. Im just wondering if I’m crazy for feeling the way I do. I’m not trying to date someone who would leave me in a heartbeat for a person who is more physically attractive than i am. He would always get physical with me as well, even when I made it clear I just wanted to have a nice conversation",Top-Job-4783,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fpste/am_i_17f_wrong_for_ending_the_relationship16m/,1690926198.0,0.5

"My boyfriend downloaded hinge when drunk My new boyfriend (35) downloaded Hinge when he was drunk.

My single friend saw his profile and showed me at 7am. I called and confronted him straight away.

He admitted it and got defensive saying that he did it because he was confused about us.

I broke up with him then.

But - after some reflection he wanted to meet up. He was distraught/ embarrassed/ disgusted with himself and seemed genuinely remorseful.

We met up and he said that he has been feeling scared and insecure about our relationship but he feels the idea of losing me has made him want to be better for me.

He has called a therapist to discuss his insecurities.

I want to give him a second chance as I was once given a second chance at it meant the world to me and gave me a chance to prove myself.

But on the other side, my family and friends will think I’m an idiot for giving him a chance.

I have a kind heart and believe people make mistakes but I’m struggling a bit.

I do feel in my gut that he is genuinely sorry and wants to make it up to me.

"What would you do in my situation? Guy I met a month ago is moving back to his country Hi Reddit, so a month ago I met a guy and there was an instant attraction. Our dogs got along really well too which was a huge bonus. He's from another country and he basically came here because he was confused and didn't have his life together back home, and he came here because his good friend is here and decided to give it a shot. Since that day, we saw each other once a week and we ended up hooking up on the 3rd time we met. Needless to say, I already knew that there's a chance he will be going back home since he told me on our first date. Today he told me he decided he will go back home around beginning of September, which is faster than anticipated. We still want to spend as much time together as we can, but it's hard with his work schedule and him living 30 minutes away. He also doesn't have a car or license here so he's basically driving his friend's car when it's available / I'm driving over to his house

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is crazy and I don't know if I'm feeling so attracted to him because I know he's leaving and it makes everything seem so heightened. He's from a completely different cultural background as me too. What would you all do in my case? Just cherish the time we have left together? In addition, would you tell your parents about this situation?

"Bait and ditch 
I (30 F) have been feeling a bit down lately. I Sometimes feel as if the men I’m attracted to who initially show interest in me lead me on by showing interest and then dropping me or ditching me. And it seems like generally the men who show consistency and desirable personality qualities are the ones I’m NOT physically attracted to. So frustrating.
I normally don’t pay attention to any man unless he shows interest in me first, but with these guys who are my physical type It’s like they enjoy baiting me into being “hooked” on them and then ditching. 
It’s starting to really affect my mental health and I find myself withdrawing from interacting with people because of the risk of getting hurt this way again.

"What on earth is casual dating and how does it work? So, I’ve only ever understood dating where you see each other more and more with rising levels of intimacy, frequency of communication and commitment. It all goes well you end up in a committed, exclusive LTR. If things don’t go well, you break up.

I have a somewhat anxious attachment style and I tend to match and escalate levels of affection. It tends to get me into trouble when I find myself overcommitting. I can’t fathom being interested in someone but only a little bit, where you only talk or see each other from time to time, but maybe I should explore it.

"My heart is hurting 
So, met this girl at a party. We hit it off, she asked for my phone number and she wanted something serious.
 
Every one of our dates went great! She would want to extend our date and everything.

We went to Hollywood Studios. She got us to take “couple photos” and hinted that I asked her to be bf/gf. But I was stupid and didn’t ask.

She went on family vacation. Got drunk and said
“Hey I think you’re great, but honestly don’t see it going anywhere”
 She then started reaching out to me like nothing happened.

We eventually went out again. Once again everything went great! But she kinda distanced herself from me a bit.

It got really bad when she had a breakdown in my room. Like a mini one. Then got embarrassed and left. Didn’t talk to me for a few days.

Our mutual friend asked how she was and she said “great!”
Mentioned how things between her and I are “going good!”

Him: safe to say you guys are bf and gf now?
Her: no
Him: How come?
Her: why would we be?
Him: idk. Figured you’d be happy in a relationship
Her: lmao maybe


When I opened up and said how I felt. She rejected me by saying “I don’t want to pursue that”

So, I cancelled our next date. I needed time out and went out with friends. (a lot of my friends are women). I guess one of the posted a picture of us all hanging out. And now she is being a bit more respectful.

We spoke on the phone and she still wants to see me and hangout. Maybe she isn’t ready for something serious. She is a VERY career focused individual. I did set some boundaries. Telling her she can’t just go through stuff and essentially ghost me. And she can’t play games of not feeling okay and me asking and her not telling.

She also apologized for her behavior. Said she NEEDED to focus on her Mental Health that week. She was going through it and shit the world out. She has anxiety and dreams but I think it’s more than that.

I really like her a lot. I do wish I was more successful and I’m currently working in that. I’ve been treating her like a gf when I probably shouldn’t have. She used to treat me like a bf when we were first dating. But stopped suddenly. 

We don’t talk to each other as much. Which is what I’m sad about. But she is like afraid of letting me go.

We are hanging out Friday. Imma see what happens.
But I’m not going in with high expectations. I should’ve asked back then, feel like I fucked that part up. We’ve been dating 2 months, into our 3rd. We hookup usually when she comes over. She wanted to meet my brother and play board games with me and my siblings.

But idk if we’re still dating or she wants us to go as friends. I guess I’ll see. But yeah, I’m focusing more on my career than women now.

"I (F22) confessed to a M (26) I liked and it felt wonderful In short, he acknowledged my feelings but wasn’t ready to commit to a relationship (very ENTJ of him) which was fine by me cause I had already expected this long ago especially when he’s extremely career driven and relationships were secondary to him. I have already pictured the scenario of the rejection in my mind (yes I am INFP) and to be honest, my idea of confessing in person did not go as planned 😂 (explained below)

Either ways, the reason why I’m posting this is that I am so proud of myself for making the first move and confessing to him. Sure, I am sad but at the same time I am also happy. I find it hard to like someone in a romantic manner and he is the first one where I really like and really thought of it beforehand (I am extremely picky with guys since a lot of the guys don’t meet my unrealistic standards and he’s the first one I feel comfortable talking with and showing my authentic self without any judgement)

I actually questioned my feelings for him numerous times, back and forth. Constantly thinking, do I like him or not? Always daydreaming and painting scenarios of what would it be like if we dated in my head hahaha. I know, very delusional of me to think of this.

Frankly speaking, I already knew that we wouldn’t work out, I am migrating to another country and in the process of that and my friend who finished Medical School and going to start his work soon (2 years of housemanship), hence not having enough time to commit to a relationship. 

Before confessing, I typed out what I want to say and feel, why I like and admire him on Word Document (it was 1.5 pages long 😂). I really wanted to meet him in real life cause I have never met him before in person (we met through Bumble app) but our times never intersect which I am quite bummed about but that’s life. Since we talk every day, I have planned to confess to him before he starts his housemanship and since we are close and open with each other’s thoughts and opinions, I wanted to make a scenario saying that I like someone and wanted to use him as a practice for me to confess, meet him in person and actually do it. Great plan right? Unfortunately, he couldn’t meet me and he is fully booked. Therefore, when I told him “I like a guy and I still do” and asked for advice and how I should confess to a guy, he told me to do it honestly and there you go, I confessed on Instagram.

And his reply? He was just so sweet and considerate of my feelings. Sure, we’re not together but he mentioned positive thoughts and told me that I’m more than enough and how he’s happy to hear it from me and he’s happy to read through my 1.5 pages of my “love letter”. The fact that he was honest with me that he can vibe with me and how it feels like a breathe of fresh air to have someone to communicate with. And you know what? I am so glad that I like him, he’s so sweet, nice, smart, humble and I am proud that he’s the first guy I like. Absolute green flag guy. 10/10 would date and possibly marry.

In conclusion, I feel that with me confessing I am able to get a closure of mine, done and dusted. We are on good terms and we still send each other reels and continue to have each other’s back and support one another. I think I really lucked out with this guy here cause confessing is super hard especially for girls. Years ago, I would never have done this cause I am extremely shy and anxiety sometimes gets in the way. Today? I give myself a pat in the back and I love myself for doing it. Being a girl and making the first move, who would have thought?

"I tried to please my boyfriend and it backfired TL;DR - I tried to improve my long distance relationship and instead it turned into a breakup and I feel confused and heartbroken, how can I move past this?

Me (21f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been long distance (7 hours away) for a year, and with that can come arguments. However when we’re in person we’re completely fine. I talked to him about doing my year internship in his city so we can be together and he was overjoyed. We found a place and paid a big deposit and I was due to move down today and start my internship a week today.

Last week he turned around and said he doesn’t like the place anymore and he doesn’t want to live there, I was of course upset due to how late he had left it as I wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else now. He suggested living together at his parents until we’ve saved enough money to get our own place, I was apprehensive as this wasn’t our plan and I like independence (no parents) and on top of that I don’t feel comfortable to do whatever in his house so usually stay in his room, but I said I’d think about it but if I didn’t want to do that then we’re stuck and I can’t do my internship as it’s an expensive city and could not afford rent by myself. He then says the place is fine (which is a lie because he’s already said he doesn’t want to live there) but I said the place is off the table now as I don’t want him to live somewhere he isn’t comfortable with and for him to resent me for it.

8 hours later he rings me and breaks up with me saying he can’t do this anymore and he doesn’t deserve me etc. of course I was devastated and tried to fight for him to change his mind, he didn’t. Since then we’ve had a couple arguments regarding my chances of doing my internship I worked really hard for are gone and how this came out of no where as the days before he was talking a lot about our future, and how I sacrificed so much for him by moving 7 hours across the country with no friends or family to be with him.

Yesterday I asked him for my deposit money back in which he said the landlord hasn’t gave him it, this then escalated to him saying he broke up with me because we argue too much, I’m draining and tiring and he wants to move on (he deleted any sign of me off his ig and followed girls back I was uncomfortable with a couple days after we broke up). He’s turned all of this on me and made it out to be all my fault and he doesn’t care in the slightest meanwhile I’m heartbroken and worried for my future. I won’t deny that we argue, mainly over silly petty things as we’re both stubborn and recently my mental health hasn’t been great which can contribute towards it but he’s said some nasty things to me too yet in person we’re great.

A couple weeks ago he argued we aren’t putting in effort anymore so I did all that I could to show him I was (I made him tiktoks, ig story posts, sent him big loving paragraphs etc yet he didn’t reciprocate) I still tried to be a good person and I sent him all his birthday presents down for him even after we broke up (I wrote him a love letter about our future, I made mini Lego figures of us, I made a picture book of our firsts, the many reasons I love him, a plan of 85 dates for us to do when we live together, and customised vinyl) I also spent a lot of money on a record player for him but couldn’t sent it down as it was too expensive for shipping, but I was trying to prove I was willing to make effort which he asked for.

A conversation I tried to have with him a couple weeks ago was that I’d appreciate if he could do my love language more for me (Words of affirmation) to tell me how much he loves appreciates and misses me etc yet that escalated into a big argument as he sends me flowers regularly but I’ve told him as much as I love and appreciate them not to spend money on me as I just love the little things and a message costs nothing. My issue was I’d asked him more than 3 times if he could do this and I shouldn’t have to bring something up more than once.

"My gf just overreacted in a way, that left me completely speechless. I will rewrite it exactly as we texted (can´t post pictures, since we're not speaking in English):

Me: ""I've just been thinking, that whenever we have a debate and we agreed before, that neither of us is using a phone during the debate, well what if neither of us is right, but we will agree on something, that may actually be wrong vs. if we googled it, we would find the correct answer and we would both broaden our horizons. What do you think?

Her: ""Finding something online doesn't mean it's always right.""

Me: ""True, but even still it may give you an option, that neither of us possibly even thought of and then we might agree, that the newly discovered point may be correct.""

Her: ""Why do we even need to use a phone to have options? That's what it's about - using our brains and creativity in finding a new solution. You can debate with any idiot if you have a phone in your hand. That doesn't mean that person is smart and has ideas and is nice to talk to. Double-checking something is okay I guess.""

Me: ""Well we might discuss a topic, that neither of us really knows that much about.""

Her: ""Well the way you judge it  is like, if you don't know it, neither of us knows it.""

Me: ""Well it can show itself naturally sometimes, that neither of us really knows that much about the given topic you know.""

Her: ""When you say your points, that's it. Period. When I say mine, you whip out your phone.""

Me: ""...honey, I'm not attacking you.""

Her: ""I know. But it feels like we don't always agree with each other and then you say ok, just say so and I'll stop. Then in a week we have a conversation, which is lead so you can justify that you can double check my info and then keep on doing it. If you don't believe my observations, then don't debate with me. Don't ask me, if you just go look for answers somewhere else afterwards. You wouldn't like it, if someone at your work did that to you. Do it once or twice and you say to yourself, that it's fine. But do it for a whole month and you just get fed up with it. I can't debate in peace with someone, who doesn't treat me as an equal. It is what it is. You see it as a weakness or a mistake. I won't keep trying to convince someone, that doesn't even see it, that I'm not dumb.""

Me: ""...ok.""

Her: ""Now you're mad. For my honest answer.""

Me: ""No, I just didn't expect this reaction.""

Her: ""I'm calm. But I could see, where you're going with all this. And I don't see it as ´just a debate´ with the way you put it.""

"""You're a great guy, but..."" All the time, I (26M) get told that I'm ""a great guy, but..."" any time I attempt to date anyone.

""You're a great guy, but dating someone who lives 30 minutes away is too difficult""

""You're a great guy, but my ex (insert something ex did here)""

""You're a great guy, but I don't want to commit"" (it's worth noting that this particular girl got into a committed relationship 2 weeks later)

""You're a great guy, but I actually don't want to date"" (whenever I hear this, I wonder why even be on a dating app in the first place?)

These are just a few examples of the many times I've been told this, and all I can think is that there's a common denominator here: me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. I always try my best to be my authentic self, I try to make people laugh, I like to talk about life and hobbies, I go into a date expecting nothing except a good conversation with someone I'd like to know better, and I respect boundaries.

"Stuck in a three way situationship I(23) met a girl(24) who has been dating her bf(28) since 4 years. We talked and we clicked. I confessed pretty quickly to her that I like her and she reciprocated. We started talking more and realised that this isn't just some random fling but that we've actually fallen for each other. We went on a couple of dates and they were perfect in every stretch of the imagination. The problem is that she's not been able to break-up with her bf cause everytime she tries to do it, he just can't take it and promises to work on whatever issues they do have. Of course she wants to do it cleanly without mentioning me and as it turns out there's just no way to go about it. He's 28 and wants to settle down and she's the best he could do so he's actually giving everything into this but I've seen them together and they just don't click. Now even she feels bad about what she's done to him and has kinda distanced herself away from me. This distance hurts both of us and I know that if not now then in the future they will most definitely break-up. I'm just wondering what could be done here?

"Am I just a booty call? I (F21) have been seeing this guy (M21) for a month or two now. We talked and texted a ton before hanging out. We met through Hinge.

He definitely gets really nervous, awkward, and shy when we hang out and never really knows what to say. Since then, he’s stuck with inviting me over at night after he’s been drinking or after we’ve both been drinking.

Here’s where it gets confusing: when we hang that late, I assumed he wants sex but we haven’t had sex because he gets whiskey dck and can barely hard enough. Yet he keeps inviting me over after he’s been drinking. He just wants to kiss, cuddle, sleep and spoon together, talk, show me stuff he’s been up to and talk about each other family, friends and life. He’s always saying that we don’t have to do stuff and he wants me to be comfortable with him. And whenever I can’t hang with him, he’ll be like “I kinda wish you were with me” etc.

However, now I’m super confused because that’s usually a booty call if he’s calling and inviting me over during times from like 9pm-1am? 

The only thing I can think of is that it’s just an unhealthy coping mechanism to be more confident when we hang. When we’ve been drinking, he’ll call me pretty, be so chatty, want to kiss me and can’t stop smiling like he’s really happy I’m there. While his personality is the same, he’s just more honest and outwardly affectionate after drinking.

I just don’t want to be boiled down to a person that he only likes to be arounr when he’s drunk late at night. I do like him a ton and think he’s great. 


I’m gonna ask him about this next time I see him but want some input? Any thoughts?",newthrowaway12002,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fjxgd/am_i_just_a_booty_call/,1690912953.0,1.0

"Online Dating is hard So I’m (21F) using tinder (probably not the best place to look for a relationship, but I’ve tried bumble and it’s just not for me) and I’m having a really hard time. 

If I see someone I think I’ll click with, I see that they live too far from me. I’m not interested in long distance relationships. Like, they’ll put in their bio “im from X but I’m visiting Y for a week” - I guess that’s because they’re after making friends or hookups or whatever. 

Or I’ve matched with a bunch of guys so I’ve braved it and I’ve messaged them all first. Just quick things like “hey, I’ve noticed X in your bio, I think that’s cool” or just generally started a conversation about something they have an interest in. But they never reply. Why match with me if you aren’t going to reply? 

It’s so deflating. 

I’d love to be able to go out and try to meet people in person, im all up for that, but im suffering with a medical condition at the moment that I’m trying to get into remission, so my social life is pretty limited.

"I (25F) don't know how to proceed with my partners (28F) behavior Ive gotten into a new relationship with a girl who has never experienced being in a homosexual relationship before while I myself have been in a couple. She's told me she was confused and was afraid of letting down her homophobic parents and I've always been understanding about that and said she could take her time figuring it out. That really isn't the problem here.

My problem is that she seems to be afraid of letting people down, seemingly becuase she's in a relationship with me. She goes out with her ex boyfriend who has repeatedly expressed that hes still interested with her. Even sometimes still sleeping over at their formerly shared place even if I've expressed discomfort about it before. She asks him for rides and entertains conversations and going out with him. She tells me its because she wants to keep him close so that she wouldnt have to explain to her parents that she might be with someone new (me), while at the same time she doesn't really wan't to hurt her ex.

I honestly don't mind that shes struggling with her identity, or that she doesn't seem to be fully comfortable with being in a queer relationship. But honestly, her actions hurt and I know she just want's to please everyone else but it almost feels like it's at my expense.

I don't know how to handle this. Should I cut my losses and just leave? Should I stay because she repeatedly assures me that I'm the one she want's to be with? It's all getting a little bit too much and I honestly don't know what to make of it anymore. Any advice?

"I look “too young” to date and it’s really impacted my self-esteem. I’m 23F.

Before anyone denies this, saying it’s “all in your head,” please bear in mind that:

A) Even my own mother has told me I look like a 15-year-old, and that, and I quote, “only pedos would go for,”; 
 
And B) My looks are the subject of every joke the people around me make, saying I’m jail bait because I haven’t developed breasts and have no curves.

I know that there’s ways to improve confidence through self esteem but I can’t afford the upkeep of clothes and makeup at the moment, and so all that states back at me in the mirror is this pale, anaemic 15-year-old-looking woman. 

It’s humiliating. I can’t flirt with men because I feel like they’d be grossed out. I wear clothes to cover me fully because I feel like I’m someone who’s too young to show anything (despite knowing I’m an adult). I can’t take myself seriously when I try to dress up nice as it feels too try-hard, and I can’t stand being called cute because it’s infantilising.

"Ghosted after an amazing date? Let me preface this by saying that I don't really get ghosted but he leaves me on delivered for a day at a time and then he responds with one liners that don't create any kind of conversation.

So we had a couple of days that were amazing and both were initiated by me but he acted like a gentleman in both instances. I even said no to sex with him on the second date and after that he still wanted to see me and was nice about it. We don't live in the same state so I have to travel to the neighboring state to see him. He seemed so shy and almost in love that even my friends were surprised. And after I left, nothing. He leaves me on read, doesn't reply until 24h later and barely views my stories. I'm going back next week and he said he wanted to meet but I don't understand his behavior. Now, I'd think it's because he doesn't give a damn, but it apparently isn't?

I texted him about his ghosting and he replied 1sec later telling me that he's busy, not ghosting me, and apologized. He also waits until my stories almost expire to view them which gives me the suspicion he's playing hard to get and is into mind games. After I left I thought he'd block me or unmatch me or both, but he hasn't so far, which is weird for a duckboy, so I'm completely lost. 

A few things that might shed light on the issue, though, are:

He said he didn't want a ldr but kept talking about the possibility of dating and also brought up kids and marriage on the second date (I didn't, I kinda laughed awkwardly when he suggested dating).

We didn't really have dates dates, I brought him with my friends both times (althoufh the first one we ended up at his place) and he's a bit shy.

He gave off vibes of either a narcissist (kept talking about himself) or a shy person that's trying to look cool and impress the ""hot girl"", clearly doing it wrong.

He said he's very picky with women and was a fuckboy years ago after a breakup but didn't really like it because first time sex is awkward to him, so now is trying to find a wife (he's traditional) because he already has a stable job and money.

When I post a ""thirst trap"" (selfie looking good) he posts one that same day or the day after lol

He told me he's bad at texting before this issue began. However I've seen him text his friends during our ""dates"".

He says his best friend is hyped about him getting with me. And he also tried to impress my friends (girl and guy) and be extra nice to them. My girl friend says he's just shy and we are misjudging him, and my guy friend says he's a narcissist and a POS (the guy friend wants me so idk about that opinion).

Help, please.

"Can’t keep a girl’s interest My whole life ode struggled with anxiety and the fear of talking to girls. As I’m sure lots of guys have. In my 20’s now, and while I’ve had fun here and there, anytime it comes to a relationship I just feel like no one I’ve been into hasn’t been into me. Even girls that I do date, always brake it off after no more than a few weeks. Months if I’m lucky. 

Fast forward to now, this girl I was just recently seeing is amazing and I wanted a relationship but before I even told her how I felt she told me she wants to be just friends. Anyways, any time we hung out and she talks about her past flings or boyfriends and they all seem like biggest assholes.  She’d tell me stories about how they mainly force their ways into relationships and other “activities”. For example she told about this one guy who sounded awful for the way he treated her, but then when she talks about them being romantic or how he’d just kiss her without asking or start doing sexual stuff without really asking because they think it’s romantic or attractive that the man is taking what he wants and ect. 

It just upsets me bc I feel like that’s what girls want.  I don’t want to believe the stigma around the whole “girls love assholes” thing bc that’s just not who I am. I can’t just start making out with a girl if she’s crying bc my anxiety and consideration for others always stops me from doing stuff like that. I just feel like they always go back to these kinds of guys. They just lose interest in me. Anyways, I felt like I pushed her away because Im not like those kinds of guys. Not just her, but lots of girls I’ve been into tell me stuff like this and it just makes me feel like im not going to find someone unless im some asshole gym bro who just wants sex.",Parzival_43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fi0e6/cant_keep_a_girls_interest/,1690908748.0,0.5

When does the pain end?

I mistakenly fell for a guy with a girlfriend, but we chose to be good people. I know nothing good ever comes out of cheating, so I had to let it pass. 

All I can think of now is maybe, if it's God's will, then we'll meet each other down the road. If we're both single then, that's great. Otherwise, we'll just play chess and occasionally have those conversations, like the one that made me fall for his beautiful mind.

"(27M) dating a single mom (36f) with 2 boys (5/7) - ADVICE? Howdy!

Just wanted to pop in here and see what y’all’s opinion is of how things are going in this new-ish relationship. This is such a new territory for me being younger and I felt this would be a good spot to breakdown what has happened so far and get y’all’s take on it. 


Bio:

Me: 27M, no kids, never married, got out of a long relationship 8 months ago, no relationships in between, works in real estate and I do really well for myself financially. I have always wanted a family, I just needed to get my career right and my last relationship just wasn’t the right fit with that. 

Her: 36F, 2 boys (5/7), married for 6 years, divorced for 2.5 years, no relationships in between, only seriously interested in one guy prior to me, works in real estate and does enough to get by financially. Her divorce ended mostly because her ex changed and became a POS. He barely sees the kids for 6hrs/wk and every other weekend. 


Background: 

Met on a deal we worked together in April, when it closed she messaged me on FB and gave me her number in case I wanted to work together again. I shot her a text and we hit it off. We started texting a ton and had a lot of fun conversations. We had a business coffee meeting the week after and then scheduled our first date. Drinks after work. I met her kids pretty quickly in the process too. Her kids love me and they are amazing, we get along great and they are a blast. Ex is POS who barely sees them and does not follow his custody orders all the time. He will be late with picking them up and delay things. Custody orders state that another guy can not sleep over with kids present until they go through a vetting process, we have not done that yet. I have passed out a few times with the kids there and no issues have popped up but she makes it very clear I can not spend the night. 


Timeline: 

4/6: closed the deal together and saw her in person for the first time. 
4/19: she gave me her number and we started texting. 
5/4: first coffee business meeting. 
5/9: first meeting with drinks. 
5/11: date playing darts/drinks. 
5/14: met kids and we went bowling. 
5/20: first night at her place alone and we had sex. 
-dates, lunches and time with kids in between-
6/9: she marked she was in a relationship on FB. 
6/16-18: first weekend alone with her at her place, lots of sex. 
6/22: she removed her relationship on FB. 
6/25: weekend with kids and we took them to Six Flags together. 
7/1: first time she came to my house for a bit, had sex again. 
7/2: old fling popped back up. 
7/3: she chose me over him, sex again. 
7/15-16: weekend with kids, shopping and indoor skydiving. 
7/21-23: she was out of town visiting a girlfriend the whole weekend, didn’t see her at all. 
7/28-31: spent 4 days with her and the kids straight. First time she let me take one of the kids fishing for a bit with just me an him. Each night I stayed until I help them fall asleep, it was a great weekend. 


How our relationship is:

We really get along well, relate to each other with work and we love our sense of humor together. There haven’t been any major fights or disagreements yet (besides the old fling who tried to come back and she turned him away). Sex is tough as there is not a lot of free time with us and she does not feel comfortable with the kids being in the same house as us, hard for her to get in the mood. I have been financially supporting them a bit since we have been together. I pay for everything when we go out places, I’ve gave her some money when things pop up and she is tight on cash. I don’t mind supporting them and she has never once asked me for money or anything, I do it voluntarily. Long term wise, she has mentioned it will be awhile before she considers getting married again and I am okay with that, gotta make sure it’ll work out before rushing into that. Her kids want a baby sister but she is getting older. She did not shoot down the idea and I am open to it in the future as well. With that said, if she only wants to have her 2 kids, I am fine with that. Having my own is not as important as being a good father to someone if things get that far. With her youngest being 5, it is enticing having the kids already being 18 by the time I am 40 myself. We are both on the same page religiously and politically. Her friends and family know of me already. We have tried to make plans twice to see her friends but something popped up with them and it got canceled. She does not have a huge social circle (I do not either) but we will both meet each others friends soon. 


Questions:

1- How do you think the relationship is progressing so far? Is it moving too fast or is there something I should be concerned about?

2- Would a single mom let me get this close to her kids if she does not see a long term future with me? I am super close to them now. 

3- She sent me the FB relationship invite first and then removed it herself 2 weeks later. When I eventually asked her about it, she said that she did not want it to interfere with our careers since we’re both in the same field. I still have my profile as “in a relationship” but she has no relationship info showing. Any ideas here?

4- Sex has been great when we have it. Since we started dating we have had sex 5 times over 2 months. It’s just hard with her schedule. The only real times we could get are every other weekend or maybe slip something in during her lunch break. Given our busy lives, should we be having more sex than we are or is it going to be this sporadic until we eventually move in together? Is there something I should try to do like schedule it out? It’s now been 4 weeks since we have slept together or had any alone time. There was a five week gap between the first time we had sex and the 3 times we had it in the last 2 week period. Single/dating moms help!!

5- Texting has went from 100-200 texts/day during the first 1.5 months, to 50 texts/day over the last 1.5 months. Maybe we just got out of our honeymoon phase quick? She eventually always replies to me and we usually talk from morning to bed time. Any ideas?

6- How do things seem to be going overall?


I know this is a lot but with me being younger and going through this circumstance for the first time, I’m curious about what y’all think. Thanks in advance!!",Party-Return-4045,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ffavy/27m_dating_a_single_mom_36f_with_2_boys_57_advice/,1690902640.0,1.0
"Was He 24/m Planning to Cheat on Me 24/f 
Hey guys. I (24F) and my bf (24M) have been officially together for 3 months. I won’t lie, things have been pretty rocky but we resolve problems efficiently and communicate very well. Unfortunately, this event has strained our relationship to what I think is the point of no return. 

On the day of my bf birthday I had to work so we both agreed it would be best if he visited me on my lunch break. He texted me he was on his way, which normally takes 30 minutes. It ended up taking him an hour and a half. When he came to see me, I asked him what took so long and he said traffic. It was 11:30pm on a Wednesday so I felt uneasy but brushed it off. I asked if he wanted to get frisky and he declined, which again seemed odd to me. 

He had a new crossbody bag, which I asked him about and he showed me what was in it. I asked what he had in there and he showed me but refused to show me what was in the inner most pouch of it. He finally caves in and there are an old pack of unopened condoms and 6/7 condoms not in a box. I asked him about it and he said he was transferring everything from his old bag to his new one and put the condoms in there. He said he did not really think about it. I immediately freaked out and got out the car. We never use condoms and I couldn’t understand why he would put them in a new bag that he carries around all day. I told him I did not want to speak him anymore and went back to work. He would not allow me to go back so I had to run inside. I blocked him on everything. I ended up leaving work early because I couldn’t stop shaking and crying.

My male coworker was also leaving early and offered me a ride to my car.  I accepted it and as we drove to my car, we saw my ex parked next to it, sitting on top of his car. I got out of my coworkers car, went to my car and my bf was there telling me how he wanted to “fight for me.” I left and went home.

I called him the next day and he was livid. He said I had trust issues and that I shouldn’t have blocked him. He does not like my male coworker and was upset that he gave me a ride to my car. Rightfully so, because my male coworker has a crush on me and tries to contact me outside of work but I keep things strictly professional. He ended up apologizing for having the condoms, telling me how I knew he had condoms, and that he wanted to speak in person. I agreed and we met the next day.

I told him I didn’t understand why he felt the need to pack condoms in his new bag and he said he wasn’t thinking and was just rushing to transfer over the items. He then suggested we break up because I’m toxic and have major trust issues. He said I was trying to find a reason to break up with him because I expressed I had some doubts about the relationship. We ended up making up and trying to make the relationship work.

After this, I found out not even 24 hours after our breakup, he slid in a girls dm that I had asked if they had something going on because he liked all her pictures. He also reached out 2 female friends that he has never mentioned before and let them know we had broken up. I had a bad feeling because these people showed up out of the blue and he immediately started talking to them, asking them for advice and falling asleep on the phone with one of them. I can’t be mad because we were broken up but it makes me uneasy. I also found out he told all his friends and family and they encouraged him to break up with me because I’m toxic.

My mind is scrambled. I will admit I’m not proud of my actions and that I am insecure and have trust issues that I am working on.

TD;RL: I broke up with my bf because I found condoms in his bag and we got back together but now I feel uneasy.

":( I feel that my bf has been ignoring me lately, we’re in a LDR and lately he rarely texts me first, we knew each others for almost 6 months and since that time we always talk everyday even if it’s for 10 mins, but the day before yesterday I texted him but he didn’t reply, then he replied me at 4 am saying “sry I fell asleep” I told him it’s okay then he said he wanna sleep again, and yesterday he didn’t text me at all and I also didn’t, he didn’t explain anything and that is making me so sad and anxious, I’m very attached to my bf since he’s the only one I talk to and have no one else in my life, he was the one who made me finally feel smth during my depression, losing him will destroy me and just thinking about it makes me cry like crazy, some ppl will think I’m being dramatic and he’s probably busy or there’s smth going on in his life but idk what to do now.. I didn’t eat for 2 days and I don’t feel like doing anything.. I started to overthink that he’s losing feelings and wanna leave me, I seriously hate myself, I hate that I’m attached to him I just wanna be normal again but it’s impossible, like since we’ve started dating my mood always depends on him and it sucks.",ciel_dark,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f96j1/_/,1690887440.0,0.75
"I(23M) don't know if I got my hookup(23F) pregnant. Her communication has been terrible Yea i know, if it says negative then we should be good but I need help.

TL;DR- Hookup didn't get her period. Took 3 pregnancy test that all came back negative. She informs me that something similar has happened to her before and when it did, she found out she was 2 months pregnant. Now I'm confused on what to do since her communication is spotty.

I'm a 23 year old male still in college. I had sex with an old friend (22F), well call her Tay. Me and tay had sex on the 31st of May. Like a dumbass, I didn't use a condom.  While I don't remember fully cumming in her, I still got her a plan B. She immediately took it after sex. I was worried later that the plan b wouldn't work as she weights over 200 pounds. However, she told me she had taken plan b before and it worked. May 31st was the only time we had sex.

She texted me on July 8th and told me she never got her period (despite her telling me she was on it on June 14th when I was laying with her so idk wtf she's talking about.) But she said it had been over a month since she had her period. I told her to take a pregnancy test and she took one on the 8th of July. The test came back negative. She however then told me she was still worried, so she took 2 more pregnancy test on the 10th of July. Both came back negative.

You may think its over right? I thought so too, however, she is still worried and we had a talk. I told her that at this point its been 6 weeks since we had sex (as of july 10th). If she was pregnant the tests would more than likely show it (I know this isn't always true, but more than likely it is). I also told her that it was normal for the plan b to mess up her cycle, and make the period take longer to come. I told her at this point, she will need to go to the doctor and see what they say. This is where the problem comes in:

She then informed me that was not necessarily true. She then informs me that in the past before me, she has taken pregnancy test before and had them come back negative, AND she ended up being 2 months pregnant. She also said that her cousin has taken a plan b before and still ended up pregnant.

Im getting concerned but irritated because of many things: for 1, her communication around all of this has been really subpar. I've had to tell her to call me multiple times to get the details surrounding all of this, and she has hesitated to to that. She keeps just wanting to text. I understand she works, but this is serious and there is no excuse for us to not be able to be responsible adults and talk about this when she is off work. On top of that, I also warned her about the possibilities about the plan b not working on her, and she brushed it off to me being paranoid. Now that we are facing down the barrel of reality, it finally starts to hit her.  I really would have liked to know about her getting pregnant before, as I would then expect to understand that some times, a pregnancy test may not be 100% accurate for her. Also, I keep telling her she needs to go to the doctor soon, and she just keeps saying she'll get to it eventually. I'm like wtf is wrong with you? You aren't that damn busy for something like this. I even called around and got her a free blood pregnancy test and ultrasound appointment. I told her about it and she never responded.

She got an abortion before (Just this year. She just informed me of that too). She is familiar with the process, and said there were programs and other sources to help in the case we cannot afford one. I'm not sure if these ""sources"" will cover a second abortion for the same year.

The last time we talked was July 11th. As of July 30th, I have not heard anything from her. She has still been posting on social media, but has not said anything to me since then.

Do yall thinks she could be pregnant? What do I tell her to make her go to the doctor sooner rather than later? She said she promises to keep me updated, but how do I instill in her she needs to stay on the ball on this? Should I just drop it at this point?

Edit: So there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about how often im actually contacting this girl. To be clear, this is not a situation of me ""annoying"" this girl. She would hit me up about it/ tell me to call her. I would, and she wouldnt answer the phone. Id text her and tell her to all me back. She wouldnt get back to me until the next day. Everytime she hits me up, she asks for money. Id tell her no. If it were up to me, id probably only talk on the phone like once a week/or when she feels ready to update. But she will give me half information and straight up ghost. Then come back with information, in which during the conversation I have to keep asking for. It was getting to the point where nurse practitioners were calling me and telling me that tay needs to be sure she is calling the office, or staying in contact with me. I have not heard from her, or texted her in 3 weeks.",ConTrikster,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fegh8/i23m_dont_know_if_i_got_my_hookup23f_pregnant_her/,1690900730.0,0.6
"I NEED ADVICE I’ve lived with my roommate for 3 years. she’s about the same age of me or a bit younger. I’ve had feelings for her for a while but I respected the fact that we live together and didn’t pursue it further.

We do and did hangout from time to time at some point our bond became really strong and we were hanging out a lot but then it turns awkward and she ends up going back to her room.

I used to hit on her and lightly touch her and she didn’t mind.

I think at some point we gave a lot of hints to each and she told me I liked this guy but wasn’t sure if she’s actually talking about me but it was a reference to something we talked about I told her I went on a couple dates which I haven’t done in a while but I told her I like this girl but for some reason I can’t tell her and wouldn’t want to make things awkward for her.

I’m a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can’t seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we’ve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn’t know what to do!

She’s travelling for a year now and she said she’ll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I’m extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she’s been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn’t tell her since she doesn’t want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she’ll think I’m a creep and awkward


She’s leaving now in 2 weeks. It’s been eating me from inside I want to get it off my chest. Id love for her to feel the same but if not it doesn’t really matter. But I’m really sad and feel it every night. I’ve been crying for a couple days now and feel depressed and she noticed that I’m really sad.

Is it too late should I tell her, or should I let it go. I think I also wanted to make sure that I have feelings for her that’s beyond attraction She’s so sweet and I like her and don’t know why my dumbass never made a move.

"Venting about a date I'm a 26m, went on a date the other day.
I had some money set back cause the date was planned a week ahead of time, so I had $120 (usd). I told him that we could do whatever or go wherever and that I didn't know him well enough to plan it well without discounting him. 

We just drive around a while and ended up just getting fast food (25ish dollars from a Hardee's)

We went to a park to eat and chat and there were like, two guys just walking around being odd. The dude I'm with says ""they are just cruising"" I had to ask what that meant and be awkward as fk, and the two dudes kept staring at us. The dude I'm with finally decides to drove away after like 30 min of sitting there. (I felt like he may have knew them or something, cause he acted weird).

He was looking at his phone most the date looking at others on different dating apps, he didn't seem to care about much I said and most the date seemed to be him either venting on his job (which doesn't bother me usually) or the aforementioned phone scrolling. How I know what he was looking at is... he showed me, like almost proud of it. I've never felt so small in my life. I just played it off and tried to brush past it.

I'm not proud of it, but we ended up somewhere secluded and etc etc etc.

I didn't really post this for any reason beyond trying to understand how I feel by writing this out and trying to deal with my emotions on it.

"Am I behind in life? I am 22(F) currently in my 3rd year of Uni. Recently I also started working part-time in a lab. I've never been in a serious relationship. I'm bisexual and I only dated one girl for a month but because she was asexual there was no intimicy whatsoever so you can basically say I have no relationship experience.  
  
I feel like I missed out a lot and I am worried to start dating because I fear that people I date will have issue with me being a virgin, that I have never kissed anyone etc. I am also very shy and introverted so talking with people doesn't come easily to me.  
  
I am not sure how even I should start dating. I kinda like one of my coworkers but I am not planning on asking her out or anything like that cuz it doesn't seem like a good idea. I don't really want any hookups I am not into those things but I would really like to get into a serious realtionship but I really feel like I am behind some kind of weird try-out phase where I was supposed to date casually but I am just not into that.",Just_Pickle1192,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fckvr/am_i_behind_in_life/,1690896367.0,1.0
"I’m feeling insecure about my sex life and relationship with my girlfriend I (28M) have been with my gf (30f) for about 3.5 years now. She is my first gf. In high school I never had the confidence to talk to girls and have relationships. I was always focused on school and extracurricular activities. Even in college, I didn’t have any relationships or hook ups either I did lose my virginity to my high school friend in college and she was also my first kiss. It wasn’t until after college I started working and got into online dating is when I finally start. I had a lot of Situationships with girls. And a lot of them even would be surprised when I told them I’ve never had a relationship before they all said I was very good looking and very charming.

My girlfriend on the other hand, had a very different experience growing up. She had high school relationships, high school hook ups, college relationships, college hook ups.  She has definitely had a lot more hook ups than I have. She only has one more sexual partner than I have. She’s done the whole sneaking out at night to go see her boyfriend, looking up at the movies, trying different sexual experiences (car sex, shower sex, etc.) 

What makes me insecure is that I haven’t had a lot of these experiences growing up. My security isn’t so much that she has been with other people because I have also been with other people it’s more so that she had a lot of these experiences growing up since high school college whereas I only had like a few experiences later in life. 

What can I do to be more confident about myself. I am a good looking person or at least that’s what a lot of girls have told me. They have also told me I’m very charming. Even my girlfriend was surprised when I told her I’ve never had a relationship before because of how my nature is.

"I think that I was not my ex’s type We met online and he seemed like the man I have been looking for all my life. I was extremely hesitant about starting something long distance, but he convinced me that we were meant for each other and that finding a connection like ours was extremely rare. 

He repeatedly told me that I was his type. However, only 2-3 days after we had formally met in real life for the first time (and been intimate with each other), he commented on my body, saying that it was obvious that I did not work out and that I had bad posture (which is something I have never heard in my entire life), while simultaneously telling me that I needed to eat more to be healthier. I was by no means fat or heavy, I am just tall (not petite) and I did not go to the gym, so my body was not toned. He had very manipulative tendencies and would lie to me about the smallest things any chance he would get. He was so cold towards me when we were together. I blamed myself and thought that I was doing something wrong or that I was not good enough. At the same time, he was talking about how we were going to get married and telling me that he wanted me to move in with him and have his kids. Make it make sense. 

I have realised now that all his exes before me were petite brunettes and so is his current girlfriend, who was already moved in with him 7 months after I broke up with him. I am starting to think that I was never really his type and that he was not attracted to me, and that that is the real reason why he treated me the way he did. Why did he pursue me then? Why did he not end it himself earlier? Why did he introduce me to his family? Why did he try so hard to convince me that this would work? He should have left me alone. He is happy now with his gorgeous new girlfriend and here I am, still trying to process what even happened between us and going to therapy because of him. He was my first everything and I was so sure about him.

"are these signs of attraction or a friendly/flirty personality? so i’ve (f21) been working with this guy (m19/20) at a little part time job for a couple of years now. this past year, i’ve been away at school for the most part, and prior to that, we’ve had a casual work-friend relationship. we used to actually talk to each other about people we were talking to or interested in. but ever since i came back for the winter break, i can’t help but feel like he’s been acting differently towards me. however, this is a guy who PLENTY of girls at work have had a crush on, and for good reason. he’s flirty, friendly, and funny- so i just cannot tell if our interactions mean anything. 

i’ll list the important interactions. 

the other day when we worked together, we were chatting when he suddenly asked to see my phone. he ended up taking my phone case off, taking his phone case off, and swapping them. and for the record- we both had the same type of clear phone case, but mine was in much worse condition LMAO. then he opened amazon and bought a new phone case (tbh- this might’ve just been a flex of his money, since he has a higher position and we often joke about his fancy paycheck). i doodled on some sticky note and wrote “thank you!”, giving it to him as a silly thing. he put it in the back of his case. 

the next day, he messaged me on social media. we almost never interact outside of work- we have very very few messages shared between us, and they’re all very sporadic and random. he sent me a meme saying something along the lines of “when you have the urge to send them a paragraph at 1am about how you really feel”. he asked about the video the next time we worked together and joked about how real and true it is LOL. i asked him if he had a girl in mind and he made a joke about how it was me- which sounds damning, but knowing him, this very likely meant nothing. i think he’s just.. like that 😭 LOL. 

and the last time we worked together, we only talked for a brief moment before i left. but he asked if i had a boyfriend, to which i said that i was kind of dating someone back at school, but he wasn’t the love of my life. he asked me if i knew who the love of my life was, and i said no. the rest of the conversation is kind of a blur, but i remember bits and pieces of it. he said something about knowing a guy i could hang out with, and i can’t remember what he responded with when i asked him who it was.. but then he suggested that if i wanted someone to hang out with, he’d be down. he said that i seem like a cool person lmaoo. 

later that night, i messaged him on social media to say that i’d be down to actually hang out if he was up for it. he did not respond or open the dm despite being active online- which makes me concerned about embarrassing myself, but at the same time, we don’t usually talk outside of work anyway. i just don’t want things to be awkward, or for him to see me as just another coworker that has a crush on him- because i love being his friend, first and foremost. i don’t want to ruin our dynamic. 

i think it’s also worth noting some things besides the no response that are keeping me grounded: he is a very giving, nice guy. when one of my work friends had a crush on him two years ago, he bought her a plant and they even hung out outside of work. he did not have feelings for her. he exchanged christmas gifts with another girl, who he did not have feelings for. he buys our other coworkers lunches. so many girls at our job like him, and it’s for a good reason- probably exactly the same reasons as me. 

i don’t know ! i’m just rambling now. i don’t want to become obsessive over this guy, but i also want to know if i’m being delusional or not. are these signs of potential feelings/attraction, or can this be interpreted as normal behavior for a guy with a reputation for being extremely friendly/giving and flirty? 

TLDR: i’m lowkey catching feelings for a friend at work, who is known for being a heartthrob due to his very friendly/funny/flirty personality. we’ve had a few interactions that are making me kinda delusional, but because he didn’t respond to my message, i don’t know if i’ve misinterpreted everything. i don’t know how to differentiate signs of actual attraction from a friendly, fake-flirty personality.",ChapterPsychological,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fb061/are_these_signs_of_attraction_or_a_friendlyflirty/,1690892438.0,1.0

we are both working professionals honestly with master's degrees and similar work experiences, so really i was only ever going to talk about those commonalities and see if he wanted to connect, if not, cool, best of luck. i would never do something like ""HELLO I SAW YOU IN INTERNET, YOU GO ON DATE WITH ME?""

We have a lot of mutual friends so we technically know about each other. I say I kind of attractive but cannot say I'm beautiful. You will not fall in love with me at first sight.

"I (19M) am considered a fairly attractive man but women act as if they’re scared of me I try and talk with girls at the gym, school, clubs, rarely at the mall and I usually get told “Sorry I have a boyfriend!” or “I’m lesbian”. When I try to keep things platonic with girls many treat me like a 40 yr old creep and get nervous even though I didn’t do anything, how is it now that I’ve made myself attractive I have even worse luck with women?

To describe myself I’m ripped, have nice face/hair, dress well, decent confidence and great hygiene. When I look in the mirror I think I look amazing and would totally date me, but then I go out in public and most of the time this loneliness has reminded me why I might die alone without ever having experienced the dating life other guys my age do.

I feel like dating apps will make me even more miserable, especially if I put my height down (I’m 5’8). I’ve only been with one girl and it wasn’t even a relationship, she was 27 and we spent a night together and had fun. However I realized she traveled a lot and did the same with many other men on a 1 to 2 month basis, my confidence plummeted after I found this out.

Being alone for so long has made me bitter honestly and I just want my life to change. When I was butt ugly I had more success with girls and had more friends around me, now that’s changed and I’m an outsider to everyone. People look at me and get intimidated or scared and I’ve done everything to be likeable socially but I just don’t fit in anyway.

"Online Dating and Weight Loss How important it is to tell someone that you’ve been talking to (online) that you’ve lost a lot of weight?
I’ve naturally lost over 100 pounds the past 1.5years, and I’m still on my weight loss journey. I’ve been doing online dating, and I have several up-to-date full body photos on my profile so that people are fully aware of what I currently look like. I’m currently talking to someone  and I’m not sure if and when I should bring up the fact that I used to weigh over 350 pounds. We haven’t had a chance to meet in real life yet, and I’m nervous to tell him  because i don’t want him to think differently of me. 
Since I no longer weigh that much and I’ve made sure to share current photos of what he can expect me to look like, is it really that important to tell him that I used to weigh so much?

Edit: I am not sure if this would be an important thing for people to be aware of when entering a relationship with someone. i’m fairly new to this situation and i don’t want to accidentally upset anybody by withholding information. I personally didn’t think was that this was necessary to share, but I just wanted to hear other people’s thoughts as well.",milinda028,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f7hmk/online_dating_and_weight_loss/,1690882240.0,1.0

"How to not catch feelings for a casual hookup Okay so I 18 (m) just had sex with this guy for the first time yesterday. (It was my first time) and my god it was amazing we did it 3 times within the span of 3 hours . But in between we would cuddle, he would hold my hand and do the thumb thing as well as kiss my hand. Before we started having sex he asked what my middle name was and we just got to know each other a little. This made me extremely comfortable  around him. He would massage my neck. And play with my hair, rest his head on my shoulder while we laid together. And I’m ngl I’m lowkey a hopeless romantic and have already been having thoughts about him in a romantic sense. We plan on getting together again on wed and hopefully more after that. If I do catch feelings for him I’m scared they won’t be reciprocated so I’d rather make it so these feelings can’t develop.

"How do you make your boyfriend's ex get over him? Hi me (21) and my boyfriend (22) were walking on the street last week when we saw and met his ex again.


 They exchanged a few greetings and life updates, and i also greeted her (i knew her way back in highschool because all of the 3 of us graduated in the same school. We weren't exactly the friends type because i only knew her through our mutual friends). And that night when we came home and settled down for bed, his ex messaged my boyfriend consulted me and showed me their convo.


 In the convo she said that she still wasn't gotten over him and she still loves him. But can't do anything about taking him back because i am here, his girlfriend. My boyfriend rejected her and draws boundaries that they won't be together again but his ex is just persistent. 


I got mad and took over my boyfriend's phone to talk to her not knowing it was me who was she talking to. I got her to say the reason why she hasn't ""moved on"" after all these years and she said some pretty much depressing reasons. 


Now this situation where my boyfriend's ex still wants him bugs me as a girlfriend, i mean who wouldn't right? I trust my boyfriend as he is a great man. But as a woman, i really want her to stop liking my man and get over him. But again, she said some pretty depressing reasons why she hasn't moved on and i'm afraid this might ruin her mentally or anything.    I'm not going to disclose any information about her for confidentiality and as a respect for her too. 


And now i feel hurt for her as a fellow woman but what she's doing isn't healthy for her. My boyfriend tells me to stop feeling sorry for her and that we should just focus on chasing her away but i can't. I've seen a similar situation as her from one of my close friends and i know how devastating it can be. It destroyed my close friend, and it will also destroy her (ex).


So the point is, how do i make my boyfriend's ex get over him without the cost of her insanity? Should i just stop being empathic for her?",Foreign_Reaction_888,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f7a7e/how_do_you_make_your_boyfriends_ex_get_over_him/,1690881544.0,0.5
"am I (22F) just overthinking &amp; rushing things with him (25M)? Met this guy on hinge over a month ago and so far, it's going very well. We're both looking for the same thing and are wanting to take things slow. But I've noticed that he doesn't know how to express his feelings. Or perhaps he just doesn't want to do too much just in case it doesn't work out?

He'll rarely compliment me, isn't into pda only into kissing and hugging at night when it's private which can only be in his car because we both live with family with little to no privacy. Am I expecting too much? I don't know, you tell me. After all, this is my first relationship so I don't know what to expect. I do know that most girls wouldn't accept this behavior though. But aside from that, we do vibe and the fact that we come from similar backgrounds is fun. He's super outgoing and has this aura that I find so comforting. But sometimes it can be hard to tell if he really has feelings for me and all it does is it makes me overthink. I told him that and he said that we can have this conversation next time we see eachother. I'm really just wanting to know where his head is currently at with us. I'm so clueless.

"Intense anxiety and guilt surrounding doing anything sexual is stopping me from losing my virginity 
I’m a 25 year old guy who’s a virgin for reference. I was always an ugly duckling, terrified to flirt because I didn’t want to be a creep, etc., but I’m a late bloomer and the last few years I’ve really grown into myself, become a bit more confident and stuff too. I get a good amount of matches on tinder, and I’ve had quite a few women flirt with me more and more recently. Women have approached me in clubs and bars a couple of times, I’ve had women from tinder say they’re down to hook up and date, my friend told one girl while we were drunk that I was a virgin and she gave me her number and told me to meet her later and she’d happily ‘teach me a few things’, etc.

But I can’t stop getting in my own way. I have this really intense, almost intrusive irrational anxiety about being a creep, violating someone’s consent, etc., and I don’t know where it stems from. I think I have such a deep belief that I’m not sexually attractive that I have this anxious belief that any time someone’s interested in me, that it can’t be real, and that I’d be doing something wrong by disrespecting that. It’s like insanely low self worth. It used to be easy to rationalise this; I didn’t get much romantic attention, so it didn’t matter what I felt. Now I do, and I’ll be happily talking to someone, or getting to know them, and it turns sexual and suddenly I need to get out of it.

I don’t think it’s asexuality, I want to have sex. I’m just scared. And any time something does happen I feel intense guilt. I’ve made out with a few girls now, and every time I have intense guilt after. I replay it in my head the next day, wondering if it was all okay, if I went too far, if maybe they didn’t actually want to, even though like every time they initiated it or kissed me because I was too scared to kiss them. 

Last week I had a really explicit example; I was in a club and this girl literally just told me I’m cute, we talked for a few minutes, she told me she wanted to kiss me and we ended up making out for quite a while. She was clearly really into it; the kissing got really intense, we were both grabbing each other, she was basically grinding herself against me while we made out and like lifting her leg up over me to get as close as possible lmfao. We pulled away a couple of times and just kept going back in. After that she said ‘I’d love if we could fuck right now’, but then my friends told me they were leaving. They said they get it if I decided to stay, but I left with them. The next day I was terrified because what if she wanted me to stop? What if she was too drunk, or I’d taken advantage or something (I was really drunk too). Like I don’t think any of that’s the case rationally; it was a drunken makeout where we both just got a little carried away. It happens. But I can’t help but feel like dirty and like I done something wrong.

I don’t know where it comes from. It’s like intense guilt surrounding sex, like it’s something i shouldn’t be doing, or like women can’t like me enough to want that from me, so my brain decides I must be a creep for even wanting to or enjoying it. There’s been other times too where someone’s made a move on me and I just feel so creepy for reciprocating, and usually they’re incredibly blatant about wanting something to happen. I don’t get why I’m like this.",Mr_Jek,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eu184/intense_anxiety_and_guilt_surrounding_doing/,1690842158.0,1.0
"ME (26M) CAN'T GET OVER MY EX GIRLFRIEND (21F) In 2022, I `(26M)` broke up with G `(21F)` who was 20y.o at the time. We had been through a lot of arguing, fighting which had seen the us being involved in a **break-up and make up pattern** which started 2019. Though last year marked the end of our relationship, I find it hard to get over her. Since the break up, I have been emotionally drained, angry and broken. In all honesty, I still love her and what makes it harder is the more I try to come to terms with our breakup the harder it becomes. I even tried telling her how I felt and try to seek closure but it all seemed to make it hard. I sometimes try cutting off contact with her and a part of me would miss her. Even if I manage to cut off contact with her, she would call after a month or even two. I even tried dating other girls but there was **no connection** of any type. **Moving on has been impossible and the more I tried the harder it hurt**.

I don’t live in LA or NY but I live nearby in a more suburban area, yet the general consensus is the same, men in these more urban areas are less likely to settle down. While men in more rural areas have more of a family culture and settle down.

"How should I (M26) approach reconnecting with my ex (F21) after a toxic breakup, considering the timing, distance, and past issues, while focusing on personal growth and respecting her need for space? I am in a MD/MBA student in US. She is in one of the best engineering programs in Girona.  
So the last thing I heard from my ex is that:

1. She doesn't know if she loves me anymore
2. She doesn't want to make any decisions about us as she's going to China for study abroad for the summer.
3. She wants space and no contact
4. She made it clear that she can't do a Long Distance Closed Relationship

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up in December of last year. A lot of toxicity on my part. The breaking point was someone who failed medical school sent me a voice note of my ""ex cheating"" and I confronted her about it. She broke down crying cuz I didnt believe her with this ""clear evidence"". Literally like two weeks ago, this dude admitted that it was him. I cant believe it. This is such weird and high school like shit but medical school is like that. A bunch of weirdos. They do anything so that you fail or to distract your peace and she mentioned that it was him so I tripled fucked up. Completely fucked up.

  
What an asshat. A jealous pr\*\*\*  
Anyway, thats my loss.

  
I am looking to move on. I tried having casual sex and didnt like it. I've been in therapy which has been good for me mentally. I've cut ties with these fake friends and only depend on really good friends of mine. I accept to give her space and tons of it. I might not speak to her again. I also dont know what to do with this dude who did this shit. Im at a lot of words that he would do something like this knowing how much I liked this person. Claimed to do it for my own good ""long distance relationships are fake and she will cheat"" I still have no idea how to address this, this is absurd.

  
Anyway, back to the question:

  
I may have opportunities to visit more often. Weeks/months at time even. Making very good money while still saving on housing and etc. and while im in school definitely twice a semester. This is something that I will do for her cuz my life is better with her.

  
The distance and my toxicity, and the baggage of jealous friends I think I can fix and work on. I'll continue therapy and etc.

  
So here is where I need advice. Since right now, I dont have the means to see her I wont bother her. Ill maintain space.  
If my situation changes, which it could very well. And I have the finances and time to see her, I wonder if reaching out would be appropriate.

1. My dad suggested I waited until 2 years when we both are done with school. This would allow us to make actual adult decision as the distance doesn't work for either of us.
2. We broke up in December so I dont know if giving it a year would be best or give it like a year since we met in person. Which was late September.
3. Just give up lol.  


My plan, if I decide to reach out, would be to ask if she'd like to meet up for coffee and have a face-to-face conversation instead of relying on Facetime or texts. I believe that being in person might show that things can be different and more meaningful.

  
Additionally, I'm not sure if I should bring up the false cheating claim made by a friend. It's a strange situation, and I don't want to create unnecessary drama.  
For now, I'm prioritizing my personal growth and healing, whether we reconcile or not. If we do decide to give it another shot, I want to do it with a healthier mindset.

  
TL;DR: After a breakup caused by my own toxic behavior and a friend's false cheating claim, I'm considering reconnecting with my ex when I can visit her more. Unsure about timing and how to broach past issues, I'm focusing on personal growth and respecting her wish for distance.

"Dating in the Western world... Western culture has always been applauded as progressive amongst all the different cultures of the world. So it is a big surprise to find that other cultures are actually more progressive than the Western culture in this age and time, especially when it comes to dating.

Traditional norms centered around a boy seeing a girl, asking others about her, getting to know her and then finally going to meet her parents for her hand in marriage. Nowadays that isn't the case anymore. People are ""more civilized"". But sometimes you sit and ask yourself; ""have things really changed for the better, or are we just doing the same thing with a different approach?""

This can be said to be true for the Western culture. Nowadays, following the Western culture, a man sees a woman. In most cases he can't approach her because either the law doesn't allow it or he gives an excuse stating that no one does that anymore. Women as well don't approach men stating that women fear rejection more. This isn't true. People fear things they haven't done before in most cases. So if a man has never approached a woman before, he will fear rejection more than a woman who has approached men.

If traditional norms of women cooking and cleaning is dead, why shouldn't the expectations of men approaching women and taking them out die as well? When a man manages to approach a woman or meet her online, he has to chat for weeks and months, and go on 10 dates before getting a kiss, and 10 more before getting a hand job. This doesn't happen in other cultures around the world. So, if that's the case, which culture can be said to be progressive? 

Why not just be more civilized? Everyone knows what they want. Why deceive yourself by going on 30+ dates just to know someone. Some chat for months before deciding to go on dates. Who has such amount of time to waste. After spending years and countless dates, they end up dating and getting married only to divorce in a few years. The so-called uncivilized cultures spend a few days and start dating and they get married and most never divorce.

"How to invite a girl out after meeting her Hello Redditors. I met this really charming girl at a festival this weekend. I usually dont have it in me to talk to many girls, but i couldnt let this one get away. We smalltalked a bit and ended up dancing a while before she went to her again. I didnt feel like it was appropriate to ask her out there and then. I  also met her the day after, where basically the same thing happened. Some small talk and dancing, for her to go back go her friends. I should have probably asked her out then.

I did however take the chance and asked to follow her and instagram, which she accepted and asked me back. Therefore i was wondering of sending her a text. I was thinking of something like ""Hi! I really enjoyed meeting you and dancing with you this weekend despite my bad efforts. Are you back at work or are you still on vacation?"". The bad effort dancing was a thing we small talked about.

"Am I overthinking things with this girl I’ve been talking to the past month and a half? I’ve been dating this girl for a month and a half now. We see each other every weekend and we have great chemistry. We spend the whole weekend together laughing, cooking food for each other, cuddling, going on dates, watching movies etc. However, her texting recently has progressively gotten worse. 

Initially, we would send multiple messages per day, and towards the evening we would start exchanging back and forth texting for a little bit before bed. Then it started to fade towards a few texts per day, to just good morning and good night texts. Now, I sometimes don’t get anything back from her for over two days. Currently haven’t heard from her in over a day after just being at her place on Sunday. 

But the thing is, she’s actively making plans for us to do on weekends. For example, she invited me to come over her place this weekend. We are very intimate together, she’s introduced me to her friends and hangout with them often. It’s known to them that we have something going on as we hold hands in front of them or I have my arm around her.

I really like this girl and we haven’t talked too much about our expectations and wants. The last time we did was about a month ago when she asked me what was going on between us. Deep down I wanted to say let's be exclusive, but I didn't want to scare her off after only talking two weeks at that time. So, I said I'm just going with the flow and seeing where things go, but that I enjoy spending my time with her. She said the same, and I followed up by asking if we're dating other people. She said that we can, but if we do we'd just have to let each other know. 

She's a great person and we get along so well IRL, but I just wish I could get some more communication out of her when we're not together physically. And we're not official yet, so I know she doesn't owe me anything, but it just makes me unwanted. Then I go into a spiral of thinking worst case scenarios in my head, and that she's over me or talking to someone else. I'm aware I have this anxious attachment style, and I really am working to fixing this. Maybe the next time I should bring this topic up with her again and tell her I really like her since it's been a bit longer now?

My female friends tell me that I’m wifey material, my guy friends think I’m awesome (no they’re not single), I am well liked in my community, and men are always telling me how pretty I am, so it has to be something about my personality.

"I cannot understand dating women hey everyone, 
little about me I’ve been solo traveling for a while now, been great so far in terms of socializing, meeting friends, girls, etc.

I’ve had quite a few ons in this trip which is great because there’s no commitment and you’ll never think about them anymore and it’s just about having fun.

Although I met this one girl from a different country than me on my last night in a city, my type, great smile(my weakness), likable social typa person. night was great but cut short because she drank a lot.. she wanted me to stay another night in the city and was sincerely happy when I said I extended for one more night.
her friend also let me know that the girl was into me so I was even more excited to try to make things happen.
We went out the night after, everything was great, we did it, cuddled and chatted about how nice the night was. 
After that I went to another city but ofc I wanted to see her again(she also said that I should come, that she misses me) because I assumed there’s a little bit of potential out of it.
when I changed my routes to see her, and even when I got to the city she was at, she was a little bit colder, sometimes took 16-22 hours to respond.
 one day she went out but she said I could come if I want to but I said nah that’s not an invitation. 
The day after she told me she wanted to see me that night and will never forgive herself if she doesn’t see me here.
the other day we did meet, had a picnic with wine, she complimented me all the time, we laughed, we had some open talks, went to a ferris wheel and listened to her earphones music together, made out, made stupid funny selfies and pictures, just like in the movies. we chatted about meeting the day after,
but the day after she disappeared for like the whole day and would not respond, then in the night she wanted to stay home and not go out. It was her last night, so I asked if I see her before she leaves, she said ye tomorrow midday before she takes the train. I said great let’s see each other an hour before and
she never responded again.

I was never played as great as this time, since I got all these compliments from her multiple times about my personality, my looking, my humor, my style, my smell, figured out she’s very into from her friend, and what? tryna avoid me in a way and not reach out to meet as much as I tried or even meet for a goodbye.

"Confused 26 M 27 F Im confused....

im so confused....  I thought this girl at work liked me... we sit by each other, she isn't a manager or a higher position, simply another co worker who works in a different department. Our teams just sit with each other. For weeks on end we had this back and forth looking at each other ""game"". eye contact, holding eye contact, smiles etc. She made is very obvious of her looking at me.  I always sat a seat behind her and to her right. She would make it obvious of her turning around to look at me then once I ""caught"" her she turned around super fast. Things like this happened for like a month straight. I got the courage to start talking to her for past couple weeks and so far she seems genuinely happy to talk to me, by her voice, her smile etc. BUT this is where im so confused. I texted her asking her how's she's doing because she didn't come into the office. She IGNORED my message for the second time and left me on read..... everyone at works uses the work messenger which is Microsoft teams. This was the first time texting her in a month because the first time she ignored my first message. Even at the very beginning when I texted her after meeting her for the first time, she wasn't short but has short responses. At the time I brushed it off. Ive made other friends from her team she's on and me and them casually text each other during the day. BUT when it comes to her, she doesent reply.... like do you know how to talk? text? communicate? this isn't hard.... like hello? What does it mean when a girl shows interest to you in person but when it comes to messages at work they act the complete opposite?? Overall she's a more of an introvert person I believe, I rarely see her talking to anymore, goes to lunch by herself all the time, always has headphones on while working etc. This is just of what ive seen by being around her.",Opposite_Ad_9825,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f54o8/confused/,1690874184.0,1.0

"Am I being too sensitive towards a shift in energy or is this how it’s supposed to go? I (30F) have been dating my (32M) boyfriend for 5 months now. He lives 2 hours away from me but we never cared about the distance as an issue. For reference, he’s resident doctor and extremely career oriented. I’m in the medical field too and very focused on my own career as well. 

The beginning of our relationship was truly so magical in our eyes. It had felt like I met my soul mate and he felt the same way and our connection seemed almost eerie. We texted everyday from morning til night. He asked me to be his girlfriend on the third date and never pushed sex until I was ready. Eagerly wanted to introduce me to his friends.

Flash forward to now and everything is still going well. We’ve had zero arguments which we both laugh at as it doesn’t seem possible. When he talks about the future he mentions “us” a lot or “our house.” But I can’t help but feel that our connection might be fading. We still text every morning and afternoon but usually lately stop around late afternoon. I’m also not one to bother him because I know how busy he is and never double text. But I do know if I texted him later, I know he’d respond. Is this how it’s supposed to go 5 months in? Am I just being too sensitive to a slight change in energy?

"How to tell a girl that I don't want to continue seeing her if she doesn't want to commit? **EDIT: I realize now that the title is a bit misleading. To tell her I don't want to see her is one of the options I've laid out for myself, but if you think that there are better options out there, please tell me!**

Hi. I'm a 21 year old guy with who's been in a few relationships in the past. It seems that I've put myself in a textbook ""situationship"".

This girl (21) and I, we've spent a lot of time together over the past month. I've taken her on dates, been to her place, been intimate, etc. It's great. When we're together I can tell that we're both really happy. Her personality and physical appearance is everything I could ask for in a girl. I've been out of relationships for the past 2 years, working on myself as a person, and finally feel like I could be with someone. I have truly grown a lot and I feel like this girl is the one I could see myself committing to. It's something along the lines of... ""don't let a good thing go when you see it.""

Only one issue arises when thinking about this girl. After seeing her many times, I finally ask the question: ""are you looking for something serious or not serious?"" She tells me that she doesn't want anything serious at the moment. Pretty soon (November) she'll be out of the country for a few months and she doesn't want to deal with the long distance. Plus, I feel at the moment like she would be single rather than committed to one thing. I totally get all of it. I don't knock her for it at all. Initially, I was like ""ok, I'm glad we're on the same page now! I understand."" I was, at the time, willing to face the repercussions of getting into a casual, short term fling with someone because she made me really happy.

But honestly, it's been eating at me. Genuinely, the way she makes me feel is indescribable. I have seen many girls in the last two years, but none have compared to this. My brain is screaming at me. This is what you've been waiting for. Am I delusional? I'm so fixated on her that the prospect of succumbing to societal standards and ""putting a label"" on it is actually always at the forefront of my mind. I never really believed in this stuff. I feel like I'm going insane. But she really makes me consider it.

However it's not what she wants, and I respect that immensely. Pressuring her into a relationship is not an option. It's either, stick it out and see if things change-- maybe she likes me in the same way but wouldn't consider committing until later-- maybe I'll realize that this short term thing is what's best for me and my school/work life; or I tell her that if she doesn't want a relationship, then I would no longer like to see her. Because I'm now so anxious all the time about it and I could be digging into false hope that it could change. Maybe things would be better if I cut it off and tried again with someone else.

I would love to hear your opinions on the situation, and could use some advice from strangers. I really need to hear it all. I feel so lost. My head's in a thousand places.

"Why do men always expect one thing? (Confused 20F) To start with, I’m friends with some guys and I also tried going on dates with people. One thing I’ve noticed though is that they ALWAYS expect me to ""pay back for the date"" by having intercourse with them, even if it’s only the first date. They are way too obsessed with that as whenever I went on any dating apps they straight up offered intercourse to me (sometimes even offering to pay). I could never have a good conversation with anyone without getting hit with some nasty cheesy disrespectful flirty line. 
You might just go ahead and say ""but dating apps are MADE specifically for THAT"". However, dating apps and ""apps for meetups"" are different things. And logging into a dating app I have no idea that all I will get is harassment. 
Even if dating apps have been rethought by men, I can’t even feel safe around my male friends. Last time I visited my friend of 7 years at his house (because it was raining outside) he casually tried to rape me and then asked me what I expected coming to a man’s house. (P.S. he had a girlfriend) 
And even when I completely gave up on dating and befriending men and just wanted to practice speaking foreign languages on Tandem, one dude asked me if I was a virgin right after asking me if I could help him practice English.

"[Repost] (30M) I've never been in a relationship, which also means I've never had a GF, and I've never been on a proper date. Am I doomed? I apologize in advance if this goes haywire, I don't know how to write what I want to write in proper fashion or if it's going to come out right. Having said that, here I go... So yeah, the title is the gist of what my love life is like. I blame no one but myself. I would say from the time of middle school up until the time the pandemic really started, no dates/kisses/relationships/sex, also it didn't help that (among other things) my teeth did not look good. And for the most part I was overweight. Before I started working for the first time at age 23, I was a nobody, just at home taking up space and not doing a whole lot of living. So how would I get my fix if you will if I couldn't have a gf or have sex? Porn. I know, smh. Heck, I would say I still struggle with porn and masturbation to this day. There was an improvement in my life around the time the pandemic started, I finished my Invisalign treatment after 1 1/2 years. But I found it ironic that I was ready to show off my new smile and then the mask mandate happened haha. But yeah, getting my teeth fixed was the most important thing that could have happened to me, it needed to happen. From there I think things improved slightly, at least I became a little bit more social, mainly with people from work. And then, the best thing that happened to me last year, I met my best friend (I'll call her Jennifer (not real name of course) at work. We got to know each other little by little, and to this day we are best friends. At some point, there were times (not many) where we were more than just friends, we kissed, cuddled, and of course had sex. Even with us doing that, we are, and will remain, best friends. The reason I bring that up is if it wasn't for her giving me those experiences than I would be here at 30 years old thinking to myself when is this this this and this going to happen. I could never repay her for what she did for me, she didn't have to do that, but she wanted to give me for the first time in my life a taste of what I want in my love life, when it comes to the physical stuff, the dating/relationship stuff is a whole other thing. Am I lost cause? Am I loser? Has the ship sailed for me? Is there a woman that would want me even when I improve myself? I would appreciate all the comments and questions that I can get. So ladies, and gents, what say you?

It's not like I have trouble putting myself out there, if anything this is the most socially active I've been in my life - while I wouldn't say I'm popular, but I'm pretty well liked with quite a few people saying I'm a passionate and funny person with tons of personality. Heck even my friend group consists of 10 members all of which I trust with my life. It's just that developing romantic feelings for said person is almost downright impossible for me, let alone being interested.

I know that made me sound like a complete self-centered jerk and I'm so sorry about that but I swear is what they've said about me.

Over the years I've worked on myself and, while I still stride for more, I'm happy with who I am - it's just that sometimes the dread of not being someone's special person is a bit too hard. I've never kissed or slept with anyone and it was just recently I held someone's hand.

"I removed this girl from Instagram because she never replies back to my messages, now she's going out of her way to follow me back again. Why? Hi, everyone!  
I'm new to this community.   
  
I've recently made a new Instagram account because I deleted my old one back in 2018.  
So, I decided that I will keep my account just for family and close friends.  
As I was searching for people. I found this girl that I used to know in college.  
I actually had a little crush on her. She's single and everything. She posts a lot of selfies and stories of herself, showing off her beautiful body and going on hikes with her dogs.  
  
I've sent her a follow request on Instagram because her account is private, and so was mine.  
She accepted my request, and she followed me back.  
So, I've sent her a private message saying, ""Hi, Lily!"" with smiley emoji.  
She read my message and never replied back. I wasn't trippin about it or anything because she probably will get back to me soon, no big deal.  
  
But a week past, and I noticed she never replied back at all. But I've noticed she watched all of my stories and such. So, I started getting all of these weird thoughts in my head. I was thinking, maybe sending her a message saying ""Hi, Lily"" with a smiley emoji came off too strong, or I came off too ""thirsty"" or I sounded like a ""creep"".  
  
I just took the hint that she doesn't want to talk to me. So, I unfollowed her, and I clicked the ""remove friend"" so she doesn't follow me back. I know it sounds petty. But I just took it as she wanted nothing to do with me. And nowadays, women will easily label the guy as a creep for trying to slide into her DMs. Men told me, if a woman doesn't reply to you at all, she doesn't like you, and that you should just take the hint and move on. Because women will always make time to get back to a guy that she likes.  
A few days has passed. And I woke up in the morning to a notification. It was Lily. She's requesting to be my friend on Instagram again. I'm very confused now. Why would she go out of her way to send me a follow request if she doesn't want to talk to me at all? I don't keep people as friends on Instagram if they won't want to reply back.

"I cry myself to sleep, heads over heels for this girl Updates on falling in love with a fellow intern...
The original post can be found in my profile, can't post links... For context I(25M) and the girl I'm having the feelings for is (22F).

As of yesterday, 31 July 2023, the intern that came in 5 weeks ago, that I have been having such intense feelings for had her final day at the organization.

 I got her a farewell gift pack consisting of a little card that stated my utmost thanks to her for the last 5 weeks, that she made me rediscover some things about myself and that our interactions have made me so happy and comfortable. I also gave a her little Teddy bear and some snacks. I asked to take a couple of photos with her, which we did. Afterwards, she drove me to the nearest train station which has been quite the going home routine over the past 2 weeks, and in the car I told her that I'm really, really thankful of her for the past 5 weeks, and that her being in my life at a low point in my life which was at the end of June and throughout July made me really grateful towards her.

 And I told her I really enjoyed our time together and our banter which she said she enjoyed the banter too. I then told her let's hang from time to time which she said she'll let me know. So at the very least it wasn't an outright ""no"", which I'm a little happy about.

Today, 1st August, at work, the sight of her empty desk and seat which is right across mine..and just remembering her coming into the roo, and lighting up the room and my life, the paths we walked in the workplace, her smile, her empty seat..ugh fuck I just broke down right there and them..that was about 15 minutes ago. I'm now writing this in the hope that it will do me good and a cry for help too?

"dating men from a different social class I am 25F and have started going on dates again after getting out of a relationship 6 months ago. the past three guys that I have gone out with came from difficult lives and lower socioeconomic background, which I have absolutely no problem with whatsoever. For them though, me coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic background caused all three of them to not want to see me anymore. I feel so alienated and ashamed/guilty for this one small part of my background that is out of my control and it’s killing me some to be different and be rejected for it.

"how to feel confident in yourself after a breakup? okay so me (F23) and my ex (M) broke up about 3 months ago, i’ve only dated him and one other person a year ago. it takes a really long time for me to feel comfortable enough to date someone and both of my relationships ended by them. my first ex ghosted me &amp; my most recent ex broke up with me 3 months ago. he told me he just wasn’t ready for a relationship and wasn’t over his last ex of 3 years and i was understanding about it. we both said we wanted to stay friends but my confidence after this is completely shot. 

why am i always the one to get broken up with? it must be something i’m doing if it’s happened multiple times but i feel like i’m a kind and understanding person. he told me i was his sweetest and kindest girlfriend and that he appreciated that i always listened to him and got along well with his friends. but it just feels like i’m doing something wrong, every time i get to the 2 month mark with someone, they end things with me. maybe i’m just not long term relationship material? :/ idk, i’ve been trying to get over this for months, i just feel so unconfident in my personality and appearance. 

i’m working on losing weight right now but i feel like the main issue is my personality. i told him while we were together that i have a fear of being left and not feeling wanted, maybe it was a mistake to tell him that only a couple months into the relationship? i’m quite open about how i feel and what i think, not everyone likes that kind of quality. i unadded him on everything about a month ago to try to move on but i still constantly miss him and haven’t been able to talk to anyone new bc of how the breakup is effecting me. i just don’t know how to move on and feel good about myself again, any advice would be appreciated 😅",chubbylil,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eumjk/how_to_feel_confident_in_yourself_after_a_breakup/,1690843599.0,1.0

"Would you consider moving to somewhere with a better dating pool? My roommate (27M) and I (26M) rent a house in my hometown (a relatively small beach town in New England). The place is great for what we pay - large private fenced in yard, plenty of off-street parking, cool neighbors, literal 2 minute walk to the beach, etc. This was never really my plan; I graduated college at the height of covid and had to move home to take care of family, and I happened to find a job in town that has been great for my career over the past 2.5 years. I bought my dream truck and motorcycle, take vacations, max out a 401k, have equity in a promising startup, have hobbies, and I'm generally pretty happy. I promise I'm not bragging, but just trying to convey that things are going pretty good. 

The problem here is that this place is pretty remote, and due to rising costs it gets more difficult for people my age to live here every year. I know almost every person my age here, and I could probably count the (single) girls that I have any interest in on one hand. It's a minimum 30 minute drive to go to a bar where I might see new faces.

I've been considering moving somewhere where my hobbies are a little more popular to try to find more dates. This would include finding a new job closer to wherever I move. I'm very conflicted about moving - I'd be leaving behind a lot of family, friends, a great job, and a great living situation. 

What would you do in my shoes? I stay optimistic, but it really feels like I will never find love here. Am I overthinking this?

"Any help or advice appreciated. I recently broke it off with my ex girlfriend. We were on again off again for a while. I miss her so much but she was toxic and controlling. I’m worried she’s going to try and contact me again soon, if for no other reason than to laugh at me about my recent misfortunes in life. To be honest I hope she never reaches out to me again. 

The parts of her I love cannot be separated from her tendency to get angry and hostile towards me if I ever did something wrong. Instead of supporting me and communicating with me about her concerns her immediate reaction was always to punish (discard) me and devalue me. 

I’m grieving the loss of the relationship I thought I could have with her but ultimately this is an illusion given the fact that she will never change. My identity is eroded on and I sacrificed nearly 2 years of my life trying to make it work. I’m now faced with the inevitable reality of a broken heart and a path that has been disrupted. I understand that my experiences have been rather mild compared to someone going through divorce with kids for example. 

I’m not ready to immediately enter the dating scene because I have too much self work to do and would rather focus on rebuilding my identity, confidence, and life as a whole.

"Should I try talking to someone I've tried to talk to in the past? There is a woman I tried texting/talking to while I was in high school, it was the first attempt I ever had at actively trying to talk. Well it crashed and burned lol, I can laugh about it now. 

A few years later, I started dating a girl that was in the first woman's network, it posed no issues or anything like that. We dated for 1.5 years, and broke up a few months ago (rough breakup), and I think I'm ready to move on. Given what I do for work, I'm limited in the time I have to go out and actively seek relationships (working off hours). 

Now that I am single again, and it's been a few years since I tried talking to the first woman, should I try texting or DMing her on Instagram? Or is it in my best interest not to?

Here are my concerns:
- she will tell my ex (which could backfire, since it was a rough breakup)
- facing a ""public"" rejection, where I'm ostracized by the whole friend network (I don't mind getting rejected, just not embarrassed, that sucks)

If I were to DM, what should I say? I've obviously changed since high school, and she still may not be interested, which is alright. Or should I just leave it and not DM?

Would this be weird or is it more sweet? So I've been talking to this girl for about a year now we stopped talking for a little bit as I was going through some things and started talking back again recently we've grown a lot closer last year when we were talking she has a birthday never told me the day but a mutual friend who worked with her told me and I haven't forgotten it. We've grown a lot closer and are close to dating would it be weird for me to ask what she wanted for her birthday?  It's still like 9 weeks away I was gonna tell her our mutual friend who introduced us told me last year and I still remember it I don't want to seem creepy,Content-Consequence4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f00g4/would_this_be_weird_or_is_it_more_sweet/,1690857905.0,1.0
"They want me to become her bf I met her online and we’ve been talking for two months, and we both really like each other we call the time and text all the time . I first met her at her birthday party and I barely saw her for 20 minutes. And then I took her out on a date yesterday and everything went great except that when we kissed I tried to make out with her but she refused. I get a call from her today and apparently it was her friends talking with me and she weren’t there, which is bs. She was next to them. And they started telling me why don’t I make her my gf and why don’t I ask her that. What doo I doo.

"I've changed jobs with a newer, more concrete work hours. And still nothing. Hi I'm 32M.  My old job made it tough to rest as well as meeting meeting new people.  So now I'm slightly happier.

Since simple ""Hi""'s ""Hey""'s and ""Hello""'s since that sounds low-effort.  I've also been hit with ""read your profile"" line a few times, and I ask to recite a piece of my profile to prove they've actually read it.  No actual answer and proceed to to mention they want to take the conversation to a different platform.  Also I don't want to travel too far from my main city for someone who ghost me (happened once).  Maybe I don't understand my matches well enough or understand them too well.

How do you find people who are understanding? I (26m) have recently identified with the help of my therapist that the kind of person I would be looking to date is probably going to need to be someone who is understanding/compassionate. The reason for this is I’m a often a misunderstood person who is passed off because of my parents success or because of other reasons. What I’m trying to understand is what are some qualities or some indicators that someone is understanding or compassionate when it comes to dating. One of the ideas I had is that maybe someone’s job can suggest that they might be a more understanding person but it’s also entirely possible that is not true as well. I’m leaning towards thinking that some teachers might be more understanding types. If this is the case what sort of jobs and or hobbies would someone who is understanding do? Also what are some of the qualities that might stand out in someone who is understanding?

"Should I tell her that I have feelings for her? I’ve lived with my roommate for 3 years. she’s about the same age of me or a bit younger. I’ve had feelings for her for a while but I respected the fact that we live together and didn’t pursue it further.

We do and did hangout from time to time at some point our bond became really strong and we were hanging out a lot but then it turns awkward and she ends up going back to her room.

I used to hit on her and lightly touch her and she didn’t mind.

I think at some point we gave a lot of hints to each and she told me I liked this guy but wasn’t sure if she’s actually talking about me but it was a reference to something we talked about I told her I went on a couple dates which I haven’t done in a while but I told her I like this girl but for some reason I can’t tell her and wouldn’t want to make things awkward for her.

I’m a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can’t seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we’ve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn’t know what to do!

She’s travelling for a year now and she said she’ll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I’m extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she’s been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn’t tell her since she doesn’t want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she’ll think I’m a creep and awkward


She’s leaving now in 2 weeks. It’s been eating me from inside I want to get it off my chest. Id love for her to feel the same but if not it doesn’t really matter. But I’m really sad and feel it every night. I’ve been crying for a couple days now and feel depressed and she noticed that I’m really sad.

Is it too late should I tell her, or should I let it go.

"IMO being emotionally mature and open is actually a detriment to dating now I'm someone who is now (wasn't always for sure) very comfortable with themselves and I do not mind being open and honest with people. 

I understand the whole oversharing and being too intense at first meet can be a huge problem, but this is not what i'm talking about. 

I mean like weeks into dating, being open about what your expectations are with someone, sharing that you really care about them and being open about your feelings. Again, this is like 5th-10th date i'm talking about.

90% of the time I get completely ghosted after. 

It's really my opinion that if you are emotionally mature and open and honest, you are in the minority of people these days in the dating scene, and doing such makes people who are not extremely uncomfortable, lesser than you, and brings up emotions they don't want to deal with. 

I am probably chasing after the wrong type of person, but its really been my experience lately with most of my attempts at dating.

"My ex-girlfriend wants to have sex with me I’ve somewhat been caught off-balance by a recent inquiry from my ex-girlfriend. We both are HSV1 positive and first met on a herpes dating website. Our shared experience brought us together and blossomed into a meaningful relationship. It was comforting and liberating to be with someone who understood precisely what I was going through.

However, as destiny would have it, our emotional pathways diverged, and we decided to go our separate ways. It was a mutual decision founded on understanding for the betterment of our individual lives. Post-breakup, we gave each other time and space to heal and move on.

Recently, my ex connected back with a proposition: to continue having sexual relations. That was unexpected, and it has left me quite confused.

Physically, we are still attracted to each other. Since we both are HSV1 positive, there’s no potential threat of transmission between us. However, I’m genuinely concerned about reentering such an intimate relationship with my ex, given our history and the emotional complexity it might entail.

Our shared HSV1 condition brings a level of comfort no doubt, especially when managing flare-ups and understanding the stigma. But, at the same time, I’m apprehensive that revisiting the sexual aspect of our relationship might reopen old wounds. I worry it could hinder my emotional progress and independence after our breakup.

Consequently, I am struggling with how to navigate this delicate situation. How should I handle this proposition? Is it advisable to maintain a sexual relationship with an ex, given that we share the same condition? If anybody experienced something similar, how did you handle it, and what was the impact on your emotional and mental health?

I told her I enjoy being more dominating in bed and she says that im just saying that to get her aroused. Well she comes over and we're hanging out and she asks how to turn on my shower, so I take that as my queue and before I know it we're making out and touching eachother. This leads to us having rough sex and I finished in her hair which she was not okay with.

Afterwards we had dinner and I paid, we walked around for a bit and she decides to stay over at a friend's because she said she wants to hang out with her pet. I told her that's fine and decided to walk her there since it's about a mile away in a rough part of town.

She called me the next day and said that what happened last night was not okay and I came on way too strong, I told her I'm sorry but that's what she said she was into. She admitted she did talk a big talk but I was being selfish but she didn't like being degraded and vulnerable like that.

Against?

Don't care either way?

Why?

Personally, I never have anything to hide so I'd feel indifferent.

I've been in relationships with open phone policies in the past (without actually calling it that) since it was just more convenient to use whoever's phone was closest at the time if we needed to look something up.

However, if we were married, it would have to be required.

"Celebrity Crushes So there's this girl that i've talking too for almost two years. We're in the stage where we act like we're together but neither one of us wants to admit it.

Everything is fine, but when she starts mentioning all these celebrity crushes and fantasies is when it makes me think differently. She always send me tiktok's and video about drake, 21 savage, justin bieber, all the above. Or just other guys on Tiktok. And she always says ""my man my man"". 

In my previous relationship, one of the reasons my ex didn't like me is because i didn't have dreads like a certain rapper. It doesn't hurt my feelings as much as it did before, but when this new girl sends me all these guys, it makes me feel like i'm not enough, or never gonna be enough. Almost like a PTSD moment.

"What's the Psychology Behind Slow Texting? I don't understand slow texters at all. Either I want to talk to someone instantly, or I  don'tvwant to talk to them at all; so when I get a text, I immediately read it and respond, usually within a couple of minutes of it being sent--sometimes only seconds. I'll then carry through the conversation to a natural stopping point. Or, if it's a text I don't want to answer, I'll block that person.

This is my procedure with friends, partners, and even mere acquaintances. I do this even though I'm a fairly busy person with responsibilities, and I don't find it at all difficult to respond promptly to everyone. Texting an eloquent and fitting response is not hard if you have any readiness with language. It takes mere seconds.

Compare this with a young woman I've been seeing. She'll text asking me how my day is on Thursday. I'll respond within a minute or two, and she won't text back (or even read my message) till Sunday afternoon. This is something she does repeatedly. It's fine for her to not want to talk, but why text me at all if you aren't interested in my response? 

Can anyone explain the thinking behind this kind of texting behavior? I can't even begin to wrap my mind around it. ",Snoo-93317,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15evjij/whats_the_psychology_behind_slow_texting/,1690845910.0,0.5

"My boyfriend was abused by his ex-girlfriend for over a year My (23F) boyfriend (24M) dated this girl he went to high school with for at least a year. He told me that she would throw things at him, punch him, charge at him, etc. There was emotional/verbal abuse involved too—not just physical. Sometimes it got to be so bad that he had to sneak out of his ex-girlfriend’s house and run away.

When we first started dating, he would flinch a lot (which I totally get, especially since he was abused) whenever I would go to kiss his cheek or touch his face. Sometimes, I would unconsciously throw things to him instead of handing them to him (ex. if he wanted a roll of paper towels, I’d toss them and he’d shield himself—yes, I was stupidly inconsiderate🤦🏼‍♀️ I felt bad). Randomly hugging him from behind would startle him at times too. I would feel so bad when he would get startled, because I know he has PTSD from his previous relationship, even though I never would hurt him. 

Recently, after 6 months, I’ve been noticing he never flinches anymore. It’s something I won’t necessarily point out to him, but it’s something I’ve noticed, and I’ve been super happy about it! :) I’m still kind of learning how to get him to trust me physically (I’ve never dated a guy who has been abused before), so if anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated.

"IDEK I (26F) have been seeing a man (24M) for a few months. I am the first serious person he’s pursued since a messy breakup with his ex of 4 years a few years ago. Since then he’s been with 2 other girls, nothing serious, had sex with them a few times then they went their separate ways then he met me. He assumed it’d be like that but I stuck around and he really likes me. He used to live local but moved away for work, about 12 hours away. We are both apprehensive about getting into a relationship since ours was messy and hurt. Before he left we were getting really close and I helped him pack and it was really emotional, he said saying goodbye to me was very hard for him. He is depressed where he lives now and I have see an obvious decline in his personality. I visited him this weekend and asked him if he was losing feelings. Convos seem mundane and I feel like a distraction. I asked him this and he responds; “I see my friends going through life and I’m here. I see people living their lives and I’m stuck. I can’t do anything, I feel like I’m missing out on life. You aren’t a distraction, well kind of, not in the bad way you think. You pull me out of this and keep me grounded. You bring me back home. You are the one thing that keeps me out of the bad headspace. I battle myself with you. You’re everything I wanted in a partner, there’s nothing wrong with you, it’s me. Idk if I’m ready for a girlfriend. I try to make my mind go there and it just doesn’t. I’m trying not to hurt your feelings bc I’ve been in the receiving end of this conversation. I’m just afraid of wasting your time.” He’s always been apprehensive about pursuing me I think he’s scared we are going to date and breakup. He used to be super against cuddling, hand holding, etc., saying it made him anxious but now we do that and he’s fine. He told me that he stopped making the relationship between us super sexual, bc we used to sext a looooooot when he first got there, he said his last relationship was based on sex and wanted something deeper this time. He keeps saying if we date blah blah blah, like romanticizing the idea, like after we had that talk. I’m so confused. Idk if he’s saying he just likes me as a friend, not romantically, or if he needs things to move slower, he told me I move fast which I do. I just don’t know. I’m crazy about him, we hold hands in public, try to make the most out of seeing each other, good morning/ good night texts, he updates me on everything going on in his life, text 24/7.

"I've been ghosted by the first girl that i have actually loved I recently got ghosted by someone I thought was important to me. We had a fight while she was in Mexico on an internship (just during the summer break, she'll be back in a week), so everything was through text. We go to the same university, and the summer break is almost over, so she'll be back soon. I'm afraid to meet her by coincidence at university because she hasn't responded to my messages, even though I've tried to talk to her and resolve things. I opened up to her about a lot of things, and it was the first time I felt in love with someone.  
  
She was the first girl I ever introduced to my family, and I had never felt this way for someone before. I was aware that I was giving more than I was receiving, but she was open with me too. She told me things that she doesn't share with other people, like her traumas and family problems. I can't help but care about her.  
  
Before she went to Mexico, she talked to me about how she felt like she couldn't be a good partner for anyone. Of course, I was honest and told her that I was willing to make things work with her, and that we would figure it out. She made me happier than I already was.  
  
But at that moment, something changed. I felt like she was looking for an excuse to be distant or to just walk away. She was inconsistent with her behaviour, sometimes praising me and other times finding something wrong with everything I did.  
  
She went to Mexico, and she was really busy and barely even texted, let alone talked. I told her that I thought it would be best for both of us to focus on ourselves while we were apart, and she got mad and told me that I was confusing her and she was tired of the same old thing. (I felt like this was just an excuse.)  
  
She hasn't responded to my texts, but she hasn't blocked me on social media either. She watches my stories, and she even liked a picture I posted on my stories a while ago.  
  
Since that day, she hasn't talked to me. The summer break is almost over, and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid and anxious. The last time I saw her in person, we had an amazing date. Now look at us.

"Girl I was messaging stopped replying Long and short of it: I (22m) matched with a girl (22f) on tinder. She liked me first, and her interests, location and listed personality traits all matched mine. I sent the first message, asked an open ended question about one of her hobbies/pictures, and she responded in kind. We sent 3 or so more messages, and every time I sent one she liked it (the little heart react tinder has).

But then after that (two to three days, 1-2 texts a day) she stopped responding. I chalked it up to her job taking her away for a bit (her listed job was one that involved travel) but it's been 25 days since then and she's not even read any of my texts.

I felt like we were hitting it off great, and one of my feminine friends saw my texts, she agreed that none of what I sent sounded weird or upsetting. She didn't unmatch me either, since the chat is still active.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm asking for here, this is half venting half wondering what I did/ should do.

"Taking a break from talking to a guy I really like &amp; really likes me while I figure out what I want I (24F) went on a first date with a guy who's just shy of 10 years older than me 1 week before leaving the city I live in and I told him about me leaving the city we live in for a few months to get some health treatments. 

We had made plans to see each other the day before my flight, but he sent me a text message the afternoon before our plans saying that he really liked me and is attracted to me, but was not ready for something serious, especially at long distance. He said that he still wanted to keep in touch and get to know me. At the time, I was like ""I don't even have the bandwidth for a serious relationship"" and we talked things out and decided to continue chatting.

We have stayed in decent communication (mainly via text &amp; voice notes, plus 2 phone calls) while he was on vacation and I have been recovering from surgery. I've been talking to him for about 2 months. 

Last week, we had some conversations that felt emotionally really intimate and I freaked out and felt like all of a sudden I actually DO want a serious relationship. (The thing is I do--but still so far down the line that I can't even see that happening in the next 6 months for me, I just didn't know it at the time when I was trying to tell him this). 

I sent him a message saying that my feelings had changed and that it turns out I actually did want something serious. Long story short, we decided to part ways amicably because I was not interested in being friends with him. 

However, I've been reflecting on my decision for the past few days, and I think that it's a good idea I stopped talking to him, but mainly because things were moving too quickly for me over text and I was afraid of falling for the idea of this person I was creating in my head (because of the distance, and also because i have more time on my hands to let my imagination run wild), so I cut it out. I find that I really miss him and I still want to see him when I move back to our city in about a month, and I am trying my hardest not to text him again and be like ""lol sike!"" 

I've realized that I actually don't know what dating is and what getting to know someone looks like, because my only serious long term relationship started after a 4 year friendship with a guy, so we became officially pretty quickly. I'm also realizing that I may be more impatient than I ever knew, because when I look at the situation as if one of my friends was telling me about it, I would be like you need to chill tf out you still don't know this guy. I'm hoping that I haven't ruined my chances of getting to know him by getting in my own way afls;djfaskld. 

I have 2 questions: 

1) in this interim time out I've put myself in, how can I really hone in on determining what I want? I find that the extra time I have on my hands is clouding my judgement making, and because I'm essentially in solitary confinement, I am feeling lonelier than usual. I will be resuming physical activity soon and slowly getting my life back together, so I'm hoping that helps. 

2) How should I approach seeing him again when I'm ready? Should I say I've been thinking about him or just ask him for a casual coffee and see how it goes from there?

"Is It Creepy To Ask A Girl To Reject Me? Reposting from another subreddit. 

*For context: I'm not good with women I find attractive. Most of the time I assume they're creeped out by me. I also don't know where to stop with girls so I just never start to begin with. It sucks.*

*Also, I exaggerate for humor. It may seem like I'm extremely attached to this girl and utterly heartbroken, but this is not true. I am only utterly heartbroken.*

I (24, M) met a girl (no idea, F) via an out-of-state program.  We didn't talk much, mostly because I'm terrible with women I find attractive, but I got a sense that she liked me back. I won't go into the post-mortem here. It was a new feeling for me. I immediately assumed I must be hallucinating the signs of attraction. I kept going back and forth until the very end, mostly because the signs kept getting more pronounced, but nothing significant came out of it. We talked twice one-on-one and several times in group settings.

**For those of you in a similar situation right now:** I'm still kicking myself for not talking to her during the myriad other chances I had. Go talk to whoever it is you like. Ask them out. Don't be like me.

Anyways, I realized at the very end of the program that she wasn't utterly creeped out by me, so I messaged her on an app (whose name I will redact for fear of ridicule) (it's popular and used for work-related stuff). She seemed to be okay with me. The conversation quickly died off, so I left things and assumed I'd been rejected. That was fine by me. I stuffed myself with tamales and moped in private.

Four days later, I was informed that it was *my* fault.

Apparently, I text like a sentient slice of white bread. It's incredibly difficult to continue conversations because my messages feel AI generated. This was a revelation to me, because I'd assumed that she didn't want to talk to me at all. Turns out that wasn't necessarily true. There's a chance I'd misinterpreted the whole thing again.

So I did what any logical person would do. I prepped a message asking for her number, edited it thrice, asked a beta reader to proof-read it, edited it again, scrapped it, wrote something else, downed a few beers, and sent the new message to her at around midnight.

Checked my DMs the next morning. No response. Rejection. Cue sad songs and staring out of car windows longingly.

To reiterate, I'm not obsessed, just melodramatic. It didn't help that I thought she liked me back. I won't lie: I mulled over a lot of our interactions to see if I'd misinterpreted her behavior. It just didn't make sense to me. Still doesn't. Anyways, cut to a few days later, and I delete the app because it has no use for me anymore.

Which is when something occurred to me. *What if she'd done the same thing?*

It is unlikely, but entirely feasible, that she also deleted it because she had no use for it. Our conversation ended three days prior and I hadn't seen her online since then. The first time I texted her, I had confirmation that she was still on it. It was a 'now or never' moment for me. I wasn't stuck to the app all day to find out but she seemed to be on it frequently.

Not this time. As far as I can tell, I hadn't seen her online in days, before or after my message.

(Again -- I would like to emphasize this -- I haven't been checking every hour. I have a life outside pining for this girl. That also means I don't know for sure if my theory is correct.)

There's also no 'seen' notifications on this app.

Now the uncertainty is killing me. Did she ghost me? Did she even see my eloquent little 'u up'? I don't know. I feel like the safest way to find out would be to text her, something to the effect of 'hey, did you even see this? \[app\] doesn't tell me and I'M DYING TO KNOW', but I think that might be too creepy to do. The lack of an answer is tearing me apart. I'd be ~~relatively~~ okay with a rejection at this point, as long as I knew that's exactly what it was.

I'm lost. I don't want to be the guy that double texts after being ghosted and creeps people out. I'll be more of a laughing stock than I already am. On the other hand, I don't want her to see my message a year after everything went down. I want her to know I like her now, and I want to know her answer now. I don't mind on this 1-in-100 edge case.

So, once again, I need your help. Nothing makes sense. I'm driving myself crazy. Someone please tell me what I should (or should not) be doing in this situation. This is my first time expressing interest in a girl too, at least explicitly, so I'm not equipped to deal with this at all.

Is it creepy to ask her if she even saw my message?",Jazzlike-Manager-848,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15euaef/is_it_creepy_to_ask_a_girl_to_reject_me/,1690842776.0,0.5
"If a guy is genuinely interested would he put in effort? 30F Ive been out of the dating game for awhile and at my job there's a gentleman who delivers supplies to our department once in awhile and it's been a joke with my co workers that I have a big crush on him. One day, my co worker asked if he was single and told him I have a bit of a crush on him. He told them that he is single and I guess he seemed interested too (that's what they said...). He told them that he wouldn't make the first move because he's on the job and he doesn't want to cross a line. So, over a month goes by and nothing.... he hasn't even tried stopping by or checking in.

"Why do ppl do this/How can I handle this gracefully? Why are some ppl like this? Also how tf do I handle things gracefully.

I attended a martial arts training camp about a month ago. It was a big one with ppl flying in from across the country and international too. Met lots of ppl there including one girl from BC who seemed very friendly. She first asked for my number just to help give rides to her friends who needed transportation to and from the venue. But then started texting random questions (shit you can easily google), added me on my socials, randomly messaged me on them.

She knows I'm in a relationship already with someone else (it's literally on my fb page and my profile pic is if me and my gf). I made no secret of my gf when she added me on my socials. Said to her face ""that's my gf."" But she keeps messaging me on my socials. Shit like ""hey u up?"" Or liking and commenting on my insta stories. I just leave her on read or respond with one or two word answers only if I do reply at all. Could be she's just friendly - I hope that's what it is - but it just feels weird. I don't wanna be rude but also don't want her comin' at me since I love my gf and want to keep the relationship safe. How can I shut her down in a kind way?

Also, if she is trying to flirt, I just wanna know: What are people like this thinking? Do they really think they can successfully steal you? And if they do, do they really think you'll be loyal to them?

Anyway just for the record,Is there any problem with dating/having sex with some age gap?

When do you think a age difference considered weird or immoral?

"Boyfriend wants me to stop stripping When I met my boyfriend he knew that I was working at a stripclub making very good money about two months into us dating . Now the economy has slowed down and I am not making as much but I’m sure it will eventually pick up again. I am 34 years old and still making more money than the average person in America . My plan was to quit when I could no longer make money stripping and once I found a stable alternative career. I am starting a small business and it’s in its infancy so it’s not 100 percent reliable to fall back on. I have never had an issue finding long term relationships and women working in my job are often married with families. Their husbands understand it’s just a job and men can look at  them but they can’t touch them. It is like being an actress . Their husbands don’t like it but I guess they tolerate it as there is a lot of pros ( the women make good money and able to have savings when most people these days can’t afford even an emergency fund, they only have to work a few days a week, and can retire early if they make proper investments). 

However now my boyfriend is telling me that he doesn’t want to get married unless I stop stripping. He has not proposed to me. I think it’s fair that I tell him that unless I have a proposal I am not going to give up my source of income especially since the guy I’m dating is not making enough to provide solely on his income alone. He has a good pension but his income is not great. I have bills to pay and have some health issues with medical expenses . I think this is a fair compromise . Either that or I tell him that I’m going to continue stripping and he can leave the relationship if he wants to, as I was doing this when we met and I actually find it offensive that he thinks he can ask me to change my job now at this time. He says that my job is not good for my mental health . And I totally agree, a lot of the men have to be asked to leave for saying inappropriate things or trying to touch the dancers. However, there are a lot of jobs where people don’t feel great about what they do for a living and they keep going because they have bills to pay . I am also preparing to make an exit but not until I am financially secure with another job or business . Is what I am asking a fair compromise , or should I just move on ? I know Reddit loves to tell people to break up too, so if you think I should move on please say why. I do believe relationships are about compromise and there is no “the one “ out there.",Odd_Match2206,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15enwku/boyfriend_wants_me_to_stop_stripping/,1690828003.0,0.55
"When you have to convince yourself that a person you’re dating is right for you, they’re usually not Sometimes there are little things that you find a bit odd or undesirable when you start dating someone but you brush them off because they seem nice enough. This can especially be the case if you don’t have a lot of dating experience and don’t want to be “picky.” However, I’d say most of us have an idea of what a good fit would look like, and sure, no one is perfect for you, but if the little things are piling on and on you might need to reevaluate your relationship with the person. I know this was definitely true for the first person I dated — I stayed longer than I should have simply because I thought I, as an inexperienced person, was being too judgmental. After breaking up and taking time to do some careful reflection, the connection with the new person I’m dating is much better than with my ex. Of course, it’s certainly possible that things won’t work out this time either because life is unpredictable, but at least I’m not worrying about whether this person is right for me from the get go and thus our relationship has a much stronger foundation.",Affectionate_Wish,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15etn6h/when_you_have_to_convince_yourself_that_a_person/,1690841206.0,0.99
"fwb suddenly seems distant and jealous??? 
very long but i (24F) have a really close friend (23M) and i think I might be ruining our friendship? we met years ago (2017) and started off in a bit of a talking stage and definitely had major chemistry/liked each other but lived in different places so nothing came of it. We just kinda evolved into friends and talked pretty much every day for a couple of years, but his ex started coming back in the picture and didn’t want him to talk to me anymore so we didn’t speak for about a year or so. 

A couple of years ago we ran into each other and started talking every day again like nothing happened. We’re almost never in the same place and we’ve always been flirtatious but in mostly a joking way and one thing we’ve always done is talk super openly about other people we were seeing/hooking up with etc. and gave each other advice.

Fast forward to the last month or so and we were finally in the same area and hung out a couple of times one weekend with other friends and (according to everyone around us) were completely inseparable the whole time we were all out. It was kinda surprising that we were only paying attention to each other bc one thing we’ve always joked about is how we get in trouble in relationships bc we flirt with people too much and “fall in love” with different people every time we go out. Apparently everyone we were around actually assumed we were dating bc of our body language, and when a I told a few people that we were just friends they were shocked and I thought it was funny and joked about it with him a lot.

We ended up hooking up for the first time since 2017 that weekend and everything still seemed normal, but the next weekend we ended up going on an overnight trip alone to see a concert together and hooked up again a couple of times. It definitely got kinda romantic at points and I had an incredible time but during a lot of the trip I felt a kinda weird tension between us almost like he didn’t know if he was allowed to be “romantic” with me or touch me etc. I actually brought it up while I was drunk that night and he said he was nervous about making me uncomfortable and then I straight up asked what he felt was going on between us. We both agreed that we obviously have a very serious emotional connection and a mutual attraction but neither of us are interested in a relationship (he’s emotionally recovering from a breakup and I honestly just enjoy being single). We also don’t live in the same state so *i* left that convo feeling like everything was normal and that nothing between us had changed.

Fast forward to the last couple of weeks and I think that …something between us changed. I still talk with him like I always did about other guys n our antics and he’s seemed kinda shady about it recently? Like joking about being jealous and he’s never done that before, but I know that he’s told me over the years that he can be jealous and insecure about girls he likes. It’s a little annoying bc even though I obviously have feelings for him to an extent, exploring anything other than friendship when we’re not together is pointless. I also know (or maybe assume) he’s planning on hooking up with other girls in the future and is super active on dating apps and I genuinely don’t care. The only boundary I set was that if we’re together physically we shouldn’t hook up with other people around each other and he agreed. I also at one point asked if it was weird for him when I talked about other guys (bc I can totally respect that) but he just ignored that and started talking about something else.

I’ve always been incredibly oblivious when it comes to recognizing when guys actually like me and have actually lost a couple of friends over the years after making out with/hooking up w them bc I don’t think it’s a big deal and they ended up being hurt. He’s one of my favorite people to talk to and spend time with so I really don’t want to ruin it, but I also don’t know if I’m just overthinking things or if he actually has more feelings for me than I thought.

TL;DR—a good friend and I hooked up a few times and acknowledge that we’re attracted to each other but there’s no possibility of a relationship between us. I thought our friendship would stay the same, but now I’m worried that I might have misread his feelings and now I think he might actually like me more than I thought and want to know if I might just be overthinking the situation",Intelligent_Hunter37,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15etlvm/fwb_suddenly_seems_distant_and_jealous/,1690841118.0,1.0
"Will I ever be able to experience lighthearted love again or am I doomed for eternity? Hello there,

Me (26F) was single the last 6 years. I come from an abusive household and abusive relationships. I isolated myself and now I am trying to date again because I feel like I deserve to feel love, give love and be loved.

Now, as soon as I meet a guy, I get emotionally extremely attached. All the lightheartedness I had at first vanishes and what’s left is a jealous and possessive woman who just wants to spend 24/7 of her time with their partner. 

If they tell me they don’t have time I immediately think they don’t like me anymore and plan to abandon me.. so I crave for more validation, resulting in: strange behavior, passive-aggressiveness, constant message-checking and, not so obvious, clinging.

I've been talking to this guy for the last 2 months, we hit it off, we exchanged numbers and we started talking and calling on whatsapp. That's cool. It's normal. So now I started developing a crush on this guy and you know when that happens you start searching them up. So I did just that. His socials are public so I could see every post, every like. Everything. I did a happy dance because now I could get to know him a bit better. We don't have each other on socials, we just have each others numbers so this was exciting.  
Anyway, so now as I'm scrolling through facebook, I see that he's made a post on a group we both had in common a few months ago and he posted his phone number there, a different one. So I did the thing that only intellectuals would do. I saved that number in my phone. I don't know what I was thinking. I just did it thinking if he ever pulled a prank on me from his other number now I'd know. That number was also active on whatsapp.  
Fast forward to today, I posted a status on my stories on whatsapp not knowing what the future held for me..A few hours later, a text comes through, I check my phone absolutely puzzled, turns out its from his number that I saved secretly. It said 'Why is your status showing up on this number of mine?' I saw his message and now I'm numb.

"Why are so many men embracing toxic dating advice? There was a dating advice website dedicated to men, and one of it's articles had the following advice:

""*When looking for a life partner, my advice to men is date all of them: the bad girls, the cool girls, the commitment-phobic girls, the crazy girls. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad girls sexy do not make them good wives. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks men should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do her share in the home.

"Different approaches by men and women on dating sites? (Not generalizing) New to this group so trying to keep the rules in mind.

As a prefix here, I want to be clear I am NOT generalizing, just relating my honest observations. 

I have used eharmony on and off since July 2021. I went to this site as it struck me in being one of the more reputable and 'serious' sites. I am a straight 37 year old man. 

My experience has been very mixed. I had some painful encounters but also met sincere matches, some of whom I mutually agreed to remain friends as we respected one another. This post will not be about all those experiences or all the ins and outs of online dating.

I want to be a bit more specific in one 'trend' I have noticed. 

I think it is fair to say that with online dating, much like physical dating, the man is expected to make the first move. I can honestly say about 95% of the conversations I have had with matches had been initiated by me and speaking to other men, they concur they initiated contact.

Inevitably, this means that male members need to have a certain level of persistence and effort, otherwise they are likely to have no communication at all. I am not talking about persistence with individuals (actually eharmony has a 5 post limit - ie send her a message, smiley face, like her intro etc) but rather the approach that is required to get any attention at all.

To give an idea of this persistence, I might message say, 8 matches I am interested in over a few weeks. Of those 8, I MIGHT get one response. I think only by communicating can you know if you are compatible with someone. 

Even when I do get a response, there is no guarantee of a follow up and I find some members find it easier to lie than be upfront and say they are not interested. 

Now before people get the wrong idea here, I am always polite, never sleazy and sincere in my desire to find the right match. I am average looking but I feel I 'sell' myself on my profile and I am open enough to show there are no obvious red flags. 

I know the problem isn't with my approach because of those matches I have spoke to the communication has largely been respectful and positive. In some cases she ultimately rejected me or I rejected her because we decided we were not compatible enough or there were external factors (different life plans, feelings for an ex etc) My point is I am not writing as some sort of insecure guy who lacks confidence or skill with women. 

I have had good relationships before and plenty of female friends. 

So why is the ratio of messages received/responses given the way it is? 

I used to think some members were basically rude - and to some extent I still believe that is the case. To me, if someone spent time composing a thoughtful message I would show them the basic respect of replying even if I wasn't really attracted to them. I literally came across one match who was asking guys to show they were sincere by writing a long message - then she couldn't be bothered to respond. 

When I have asked women about this, the responses are usually as follows: 

\- they had got hurt and felt foolish by making the first move and then getting rejected. 

\- Due to experience of sexual harassment they mistrusted the intentions of guys on dating sites. 

So let's consider these two points -

\- No one likes to be rejected but men get hurt too yet still have no choice but to continue making the first move

\- To be fair, this probably is something female members experience much more and I can understand if a woman is getting constant sleazy messages, she would become cynical and feel that is all male members are interested in. But this also in my view depends on the specific site. Some simply have a better quality of members than others. And of course there are plenty of men who are sincere in their search and not just looking for sex. 

I have also considered practical factors. Ultimately dating sites are businesses and in order to make a profit they rely on paid memberships. It may well be that a lot of members sign up to these sites then realize they cannot respond to messages. Or in some cases it really is an issue of time commitment - some people go in half-heartedly and/or simply get to busy to follow up. I think this is understandable - however I still think there should be a basic sense of consideration for others and that is something that people don't take accountability for. I am not talking about rejection. Any female or male member has a right to reject someone if they are not interested but there is no excuse to mislead someone or waste their time. 

Anyway, i'll round this up.

Some people may falsely interpret this as a rant about women on dating sites. It really isn't. I am well aware that people are individuals and for every entitled person who doesn't consider others there is another considerate person who does.

I think men and women both face pressures but in different ways. Broadly speaking (again I am not generalizing or saying one size fits all) Men do have to make more effort in that initial contact and experience message after message being ignored or not followed up. 

But women may well experience issues that we men cannot see. Maybe the aforementioned sleaziness is higher than one might think. After all, I can't see directly how other guys are communicating. Maybe pressure to 'not hurt his feelings' by telling him the truth. Personally I would rather have a polite rejection than ignored and I have experienced both. For me a polite rejection just means it is not meant to be with that person whereas being ignored really saps energy and makes you wonder - what is the point of trying? 

I have posted this in the spirit of being candid about my own experience and for something to think about. It is in no way intended to incite a 'battle of the sexes' but rather, hopefully help people to be more considerate in their approach to online dating. Maybe you are a woman and thinking 'but guys do that to!' and I would not argue. Online dating is damn difficult and takes enormous patience but I think people who are sincere and serious can all help to create a better experience.

Do members agree with my take? Maybe you have experienced something different? Maybe women here can follow up on some of the points i've raised for instance. But I do feel that whilst online dating can be trying for anyone, there are basic approaches that differ. In no way do I claim to speak for all men and I am absolutely aware people are individuals, I just think that men and women do think in different ways about some of this. 

Finally, I would appreciate no snarky responses ie 'this guy is just bitter etc' - my intention here is for mature discussion in the spirit I have written this. 

Actually at the time of writing, I am getting particularly close to one lady and whilst practical circumstances may keep us apart (she has a pre-planned work contract abroad and we are still awaiting the outcome of her exam) - so I am writing more in retrospect and to be informative and thought-provoking.

"Cultural Differences in Dating: Need Advice from U.S. Locals Hi everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl from Europe who recently came to the U.S. as an au pair. It's been a really exciting journey so far, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how boys here interact compared to back home.  
In my home country, it seems like boys are quite direct and straightforward when they're interested in someone. However, here in the U.S., I've noticed that their approach can be quite different, sometimes more nuanced or indirect.  
I find it somewhat challenging to interpret their actions and intentions. Are they just being friendly or are they interested in something more? I don't want to misinterpret any signals or make any assumptions that could lead to awkward situations.  
I guess what I'm asking is: could anyone give me some insights or advice on how to navigate these cultural differences? What signs should I look out for that might indicate a boy is interested in more than just friendship? I'd really appreciate any input, especially from those who have grown up here and understand the dating culture better.  
Thanks in advance!

"How do I become a real person? So I realized after looking at all these profiles over years and years, and reading all these posts about what to do, what not to do. My issue is that I’m not a real person. My profile just has selfies and pictures of my cats. Real people actually take pictures when they are out with their friends or accomplish something big or go somewhere cool. 

For that matter, real people go out with their friends, accomplish big things and go cool places. I don’t really do any of those things. I don’t enjoy my life. 

In fact, I kind of hate myself. I showed as much when 10 years ago as a teen I sliced up my arm. Of course I’m better now. I’ve spent so much money on therapy and doing all the right things. I have hobbies; I have “friends”; I work myself to death in the gym; I take my meds; I am finishing a graduate degree. And yet, nothing I do can ever remove that massive red flag from my body. It can never make me a real person again. And you can’t be in a relationship with someone who is not real, at least not for very long or if they aren’t obscenely good looking. I mean I’m not ugly, but not good looking enough to make up for the red flags. 

It’s a bit of a vicious cycle. I hate myself because I’m not a real person, but I can’t become a real person until I stop hating myself.",MathtutoringCT,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15erbj4/how_do_i_become_a_real_person/,1690835802.0,1.0
"27 M claims that pull out is effective birth control--- does he think I'm dumb/ is he joshing me? So I 27(F) dated this guy awhile ago but I still can't get over the fact he tried to convince me that pull out method was ok just because him and his last gf did it and she naturally tracked her ovulation. I kindly sent him a Planned Parenthood page before he could gaslight me any further about sex education and pointed out that we weren't anywhere near the exclusive stage so we won't be having sex without condoms even tho he ""can't get hard without them."" I told him we are not doing that until we are exclusive and if he wants to have that conversation then we can. He also tried to get sympathy/comfort for sending in STD tests when he asked ""Do you think I'm disgusting is that why you're asking for them?"" No, dude these are standard safe sex practices and we met off an app. This guy can't be for real right that he doesn't know these things at 27? He's just trying to have sex how he wants right? It's so hard having to educate grown ass people on safe sex and expect them to want to use things like dental dams when even condoms get so much push back.

"I want to date again but I still feel hurt from my ex. So I dumped my ex like a year and three months ago. We've been together for 7 years and dated for 2.

Eventually I left her for being too disrespectful and insulting towards me. Essentially she was using me to vent and always had anger attacks that needed therapy.

Of course, she met and bragged about her new guy 2 weeks after the fact. And looking back on it. She reached out to me after an abusive ex dumper a couple of weeks prior. So I was a rebound that became long term and worked for the most part.

It's been a long time since all that mess. I waited with hopes for her to return for eleven months and just stopped waiting for her like a month ago.

Nevertheless, I know I'm not ready to date again just yet. 

The pain I feel is more so the realization of what type of person she really is. And I feel... Dissapointed by who she turned out to be and by how much I loved her.

I did have a rebound like 2 months after we broke up but It was only for like a week and that girl is now my best friend.

I am of the belief that love is not looked for. It's found. Love comes to you. So I won't go on dating apps or anything. Neither would I try to utilize a new relationship to replace my pain. (Like my ex did.) I just don't know if It's ok to date if my wounds are of dissapointment. I know I will continue to lament the bad ending of this chapter until I start the new chapter. But am I ok? I don't want to bore my new partner with my ex. But at the same time, It's a wound I'd like to share. It really has done a number in me.

I want to be fair. To be a healthy boyfriend who gives his all and have a girl that offers the same. To carry each other when one is down and to walk this life together. To laugh and sacrifice.

I know I'm not ready, quite yet. But it's been plenty of time. And I do not know if this level of wound is acceptable for a new beggining. What can you tell me?",Joseph18Gamer,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15er3u3/i_want_to_date_again_but_i_still_feel_hurt_from/,1690835317.0,1.0
"First date was a disaster So I (29) went on a first date Friday night with a man (31) that I’ve been talking to for a little over 2 months. We met through mutuals, he added me on IG and it kinda just went from there. There was no actual intent on dating the first month of chatting—there was friendship and it naturally grew into more. We texted everyday and FT. We didn’t meet up as quickly because he lives 2hrs away and he had lagged on the 3 previous attempts to hang out… (yes I know how that looks) it was always bs excuses (I’m sick, my eye is red, I’m scared to meet you because I’m not social) but somehow I was dumb enough to look past it. I knew he was extremely shy. 

He finally made plans to visit me on his day off and decided to book a room suggesting we have dinner and meet for breakfast the next morning…but red flags were starting to appear before he even got to my city for example when I asked for his eta so I can “get ready” he replied with a snarky “why would you need to get ready? I told you I always look like a bum. Don’t dress too nicely it’ll just make me feel awkward.” I thought it was weird but I decided to reassure him (like I always had to do) despite the uneasiness knowing he had self esteem issues due the constant self deprecating remarks he made about himself to me.

So he makes it to the hotel, tells me he doesn’t want to pick me up because he’s driving an old car and that he needed to “reset before meeting me.” So I was like sure that’s fine. I thought maybe he just wanted to lay down for a bit or something.

He tells me when to head out. I got to the restaurant approximately 5-8 minutes after him, greeted him warmly and I all got was a cold “did you see what I texted you? It’s a 40 minute wait.” I said “oh ok should we go walk?” (We were in a market place setting) Meanwhile he’s sulking and obviously annoyed he gets up “I guess” then I suggest we sit at an empty table so we could comfortably talk and he got even more irritated. We sit down, he tells me “this is annoying why would you pick this place knowing I don’t like crowds I feel like you did this maliciously and on purpose to take shots at me” he told me in a previous conversation that he doesn’t like crowds but in no way did I think to this extent… I was in shock! I again tried to reassure him that I would never do such a thing, even asking him if he wanted to go somewhere else. He declined “what’s the point I already put my name down” 

He gets the “table is ready” text so we get seated and while we’re looking at the menu I mention I might just get something small BUT HE EVEN GOT ANNOYED AT THAT. “Why would you pick this place knowing you were just going to get an appetizer. It’s awkward that I’m going to be eating and you’re not.” Uhhh??? at this point getting up and walking out was running through my head. He ordered hot sake shots, took the first one without me lol. Told me to taste his cocktail so I took 2 sips and he said “might as well keep it, since you’re drinking it all.” 

Fast forward to the end of the night…. He pays the bill and we walk outside. He offers to walk me to my car &amp; asks me “where’d you park at?”  I tell him I parked behind the theater. He replies “like I know where the hell that’s at” 
Not even half way there I stop him and we exchange a few words gave him a side hug and dipped. When I got home I texted “thanks for dinner” he instantly responded “you’re welcome. I’m sorry for taking your time.” GUYS WTF   I’ve never been treated this way and was in absolute disbelief.

After that text I blocked him on everything.",Samdgreat,765,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dg6t5/first_date_was_a_disaster/,1690705232.0,0.96

"Advice on recent dating situation - uncertain about interest Hi everyone, I could use some advice on a dating situation that has me feeling a bit confused. I've been seeing this guy for almost a month now, and things seemed to be going well. We've been texting every day and meeting up every weekend. 

Last weekend, we had a fun double date with some friends, and everything seemed great. However, on Sunday, things got a bit weird.

He seemed a bit distant when I arrived on Saturday, but he blamed it on being tired from a late night out. The double date went well, or so I thought, but on Sunday, he suddenly had to meet a friend for a last-minute thing. He mentioned he thought he told me about it the night before, but I don't recall that conversation. After spending the night together, he texted me later in the day, and our texts have become quite cold. 

I'm torn between ignoring his last message to save face as he has suddenly gone cold and risk looking too keen if I bring up my concerns.

"Was it my fault? So I (F21) matched with this guy (M23) on Tinder about a year or so ago. But it turns out that we actually went to high school together, which I thought was cool. Nothing really came out of us dating, and he’s not a bad looking guy at all. Fairly attractive, a friendly sense of humor. But we talked about the thought of dating but decided being friends would be for the better. We became good friends and text here and there and that’s it. No more, no less.

However I recently got on Bumble, saw his profile and texted him saying “I just saw you on Bumble” then he goes “Really? I’m assuming you have an account or something?” I told him that I recently joined a couple of days ago and thought it was funny that he was on there. He said “How come I didn’t see you on there then?” Me and him usually have a playful tone in texting, so I said “Well my account is still pretty new. But also because good things are hard to come by! Lol.” I was just playing around, because that’s how we always normally text. I didn’t mean for it to sound sexual. Next thing you know, he texted me a full nude photo of himself and said “Would *this* be hard to come by?” It was a mirror selfie, his hand was on his dick and everything. He was hard.

Man, I’m really upset right now. Like, my chest is hurting and I’m extremely uncomfortable. Why did this happen? I didn’t want him to send a nude. Was it something I said? Did the tone of my text come off as sexual or something? I wasn’t intending for it to be that way but now I’m super upset and don’t know what to do. I thought he was a friend I could trust, and for some stupid reason, I let that get the best of me. I haven’t answered because I’m in shock. Am I overreacting? What should I do? Should I say something, or just not reply at all, or block him?

"Dating while trying to lose weight, clinically depressed, and tired. There's two lines of thought when it comes to dating and being happy. One is that you need to be happy with yourself before dating as it's not the responsibility of the other person to make you happy. This paints your partner as more of a supplement to your already great life. The other comes from Plato who insists we're not whole until we find our soulmate.

&gt;*Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature. Each of us, then, is a ‘matching half’ of a human whole…and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him.*

With that being said, I'm not happy. I'm overweight, clinically depressed, tired, and unmotivated. Appealing to the opposite sex? Absolutely not, but luckily for me, I don't open with that on dating apps. I wonder, is there truth to Plato's idea of love? I would think so as finding someone to do things with would alleviate the depression and cooking with each other would stop all the takeout. There'd also be someone there to hold you accountable for your actions.

Anyone experience it firsthand? Has your partner made you a better person or were you already a good person beforehand?

P.S. I'm in treatment for my issues.

"“Forgot to respond” I (24f) went on a good first date this past Thursday and we both expressed interest in a second date. I only gave him (25m) my number and IG towards the end of the date. 

I texted him Friday after work about making second date plans and he didn’t get back until noon on Saturday citing that he was busy and couldn’t respond earlier and asked if we could do it after he returns from vacay in mid-August. 

No problem, so I said sure and asked him whether he’d like to keep in touch. He again didn’t respond until 6 pm on Sunday citing “duuuude omg I forgot to respond again” and said that yes we should definitely keep in touch. 

This is probably a non-issue but his response just irked me. I’m not entitled to a response but the casual-ness of it made me feel like an after thought. He was also reposting things on his IG story so I could tell I was being ignored but damn ok. It’s only been one date so it’s not a big deal but meh I had to convince myself to respond back to him just now.

"Accidentally going on a date with my parents friend’s daughter, thoughts? I (26M) matched with a girl a few days ago. We have lots of similar interests (music, lifestyle, etc.) We’re meeting for dinner this Wednesday &amp; things are going great.

I ended up finding her FB and saw she was friends with my stepmom. I asked my dad about it and apparently my stepmom &amp; her mom have been best, best friends since college. Sorority sisters, at each others weddings, the whole shebang. Apparently this girl and I have been at some of the same get-togethers, but just never spoke.

"I just want to be someone's priority... Hey hey! I've recently been thinking a lot about *why* I want to be in a relationship because I've always felt a sort of desperation behind it. I finally came to the conclusion that it's pretty much solely because I want to be prioritized.

I'm extremely extroverted and thus have a huge network of friends, many who I consider myself very close to. 90% of the time, I feel great and like I don't even need to date because I can always ask one of my friends to do fun date-like activities that I'd do with a bf/gf. Honestly, many of my friends *feel* like a significant other to me (minus like...sex lol) so it's great to have them around. But it's the rare times when I ask one of these close friends to make plans and they turn me down in order to do something with *their* significant other that send me straight to sad land. 

Like, I totally get it and they obviously should prioritize their partner, but it's just like damn...I'll always be #2 to everyone if I'm single. There's no one I can 100% outright rely on to be there for me. That thought makes me sad, then I get anxious, then I start frantically dating.

"I (24M) am overthinking gf’s (24F) relationship with make best friend Hey y’all! My (24M) girlfriend (24F) is great. Never given me a reason to not trust her. She truly loves me and I love her. 

But she has a coworker male best friend - that in all honesty, he’s great. He’s awesome. Based on our few interactions, he’s a genuine guy. And I’m jealous of him. 

He can make my partner laugh in ways I’ve never seen. They’re constantly smiling at each other. Any time he talking, she’ll perk up and listen to his every word. L She’ll compliment him in ways she complimented me in the past. (I was really happy when she told me she was attracted to how wise I am. But then also called him wise at a different time. I know, I’m being dramatic but it bothered me for some reason). She likes the way he dresses and talks. We’re similar in many ways, but he does things.. better? 

Because of prior experience with being cheated on, I have insecurities around ‘competing’ with other men in partner’s lives.

She has not given me any reason to doubt her and I know this is a me issue that I need to work on.

I asked her why they never sought each other romantically. She said it’s because they practically grew up together and sees him as a brother. Totally valid and rational.

However, my ex cheated on me with her “brother” so it’s hard for me to let this go mentally and I don’t want to sabotage our beautiful relationship. 

I’m worried that she will eventually see him more than a friend based on how they interact. I’m also worried that I am a second choice to him. 

****Women of Reddit, do y’all have a male friend who is like a brother? Why didn’t you pursue anything? Has your boyfriend ever expressed concern about that friend? Was your partner a second option compared to said friend?****

"Mein Freund erzählt Dinge weiter, die nie passiert sind 


Ich weiß garnicht wo ich anfangen soll. Ich (18) bin mit meinen Freund (17) schon seit knapp 3 Jahren zusammen. In letzter Zeit ist er sehr komisch und desinteressiert mir gegenüber geworden, früher haben wir uns oft gestritten wenn ich mal einkaufen gehen wollte oder ich 10min zu spät von der Arbeit kam. Selbst wenn ich mal etwas zu lange duschen oder auf zu Toilette wa wurde er sauer. Er hat mir absolut alles erzählt, wa nie herablassend und wollte immer mit mir etwas machen. Er hat mich überall zu seinen Freunden mit mitgenommen und ich habe die ersten 6 Monate der Beziehung niemanden treffen dürfen außer ihn. Also es war wirklich extrem. 

Darum geht es aber nicht, ich habe wegen den ständigen Streits und weil ich absolut nix machen darf mit ihm vor ca 4 Monaten Schluss gemacht. Er meinte er ändert sich und wir sind wieder zusammen gekommen.

Er hat sich geändert, innerhalb eines Monats war ich ihm komplett egal. Ich durfte nicht mehr mit zu seinen freunden, generell ist er mit mir nicht raus gegangen. Er hatte immerwieder  andere ausreden parat. Ich musste ihn jedes Mal 3-4 Stunden wort wörtlich anbetteln und weinen dass er sich mit mir trifft, ihn mit Sex, bestelltem essen, Zigaretten oder Drogen locken, oder ihm drohen dass die Beziehung bald vorbei ist wenn das so weiter geht. Jetzt könnte man sagen, ja er hat einfach keine Lust mehr auf die Beziehung, aber immer wenn er gemerkt hat ich bin dabei Schluss zu machen schreibt er mir Paragrafen wie sehr er mich doch liebt und will dass ich vorbei komme, weint und verspricht mit mir die Tage auf ein Date gehen so wollen. Nur um mir dann am abgemachten Tag kurzfristig zu sagen er hat doch gerade kein Bock, bleibt bei seinen Freunden und dass ich aufhören soll zu heulen weil ihn das ja nervt. teilweise hat er mir VON SEINER HAUSTÜR weg geschickt. 

Mit mir redet er nicht über was ihn in der Beziehung stört und seine Freunde mögen mich alle nicht weil er denen jedes mal eine komplett falsche Geschichte erzählt, lieber mit denen redet. Ich dachte, er erzählt die Dinge eben aus seiner Sicht.

Die Tage habe ich bei übernachtet und ich weiß das ist nicht richtig, aber ich wa an deinem Handy. Ich hatte langsam das Gefühl dass ein anderes mädchen der Grund für sein Verhalten ist, immer wenn ich es angesprochen habe wurde er sauer und hat sein Handy versteckt. Außerdem wollte ich schauen was er über mich erzählt und wie er sich fühlt. Ich bin eine Person die nichts böse nimmt, ich wollte wirklich nur mal seine Sicht verstehen. Andere Frauen habe ich nicht gefunden, aber sehr viele Chats mit meinem Namen. Er hat seinen Freunden erzählt ich hätte ihn mehrmals Betrogen. Er hat ihnen erzählt ich habe ihn oft beleidigt und ich hätte ihn geschlagen. Er hat Bilder von blauen Flecken geschickt und meinte ich wäre das gewesen. Einmal hat er sein Handy im Streit kaputt gemacht, er hat ihnen erzählt ich hätte es kaputt gemacht weil ich einen Chat mit seiner Schwester gefunden hätte und eifersüchtig gewesen wäre. Ich wa davor noch nie an seinem Handy. Er meinte ich würde ihm verbieten feiern zu gehen, seine Freunde zu sehen und habe raus gefunden dass er sehr oft im Club wa oder nachts im Park feiern. Ich weiß nicht warum er das alles heimlich gemacht hat, ich habe ihm noch nie gesagt dass ich etwas dagegen habe und das habe ich auch nicht. Er hat sehr oft geschrieben ich hätte Schluss gemacht, wäre mit Jungs draußen und betrunken. Fast allen seinen Freunden hat er am gleichen Tag geschrieben sie sollen mich auf insta blocken oder von der Story blocken. Er hat auch Freundinnen von sich geschrieben dass ich den Kontakt verbiete, welche die ich persönlich kenne und befreundet bin. Mir ist das so peinlich dass er so etwas behauptet. 

Ich habe auch Audios gefunden in denen er erzählt er hat garkein Bock mehr auf mich und sich freut wenn die Beziehung vorbei ist weil er dann endlich wieder der Playboy sein könnte der er eigentlich ist und er nicht an die wahre Liebe glaubt. Das wäre alles nur eine teenage Beziehung und die wahre Liebe kommt ja später. 
Falls das seine ehrlich Meinung ist akzeptiere ich das natürlich, aber mir erzählt und kämpft er eben für etwa komplett anderes und verachtet Leute mit dieser Meinung. 

Diese Dinge schreibt er erst seit dem er so extrem kalt (seit der Trennung) geworden ist, alles davor waren Texte in denen er sagt dass er mich liebt, sich freut mich zu sehen oder in denen er wirklich nach Rat wegen Streits fragt. 

Ich weiß nicht was das soll, absolut nichts davon ist wahr. Diese Sachen sind alle komplett ausgedacht. Was soll ich jetzt machen ? Ich kann ihm nicht sagen dass ich an seinem Handy war, er würde zurecht komplett ausrasten und das vertrauen wäre kaputt. Bitte nicht blump ,,einfach Schluss machen“, wir verstehen uns eigentlich sehr gut und haben sehr schöne Momente zusammen, lachen und haben Spaß. Das Waren jetzt ausschließlich die schlechten Dinge. 

Danke fürs lesen vom langen Text, ich habe mir extra Reddit runtergeladen weil ich nicht weiter weiß 😅 meinen Freunden könnte ich das nicht erzählen.",drippy-goose,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15emqgv/mein_freund_erzählt_dinge_weiter_die_nie_passiert/,1690825298.0,0.33
"It's only toxic if you treat people like shit. If you date someone who is a type of person you say sou won't date becasuse someone told you it was ""toxic"" not to and you are miserable about it adnd you treat that person like shit then that's toxic. If you didn't date those people that YOU know YOU don't want and treat the people that you want great then that's non toxic. 

You might not agree about someone's age preferences, single-mom exclusion, race exclusion, size exclusion, etc., however sexual and romantic attraction is irrational. There is literally no logical foundation in human attraction, which is a good thing. But just declaring it as ""toxic"" ""hate"" or predatory is just irresponsible, after all people's lives have been ruined by people just throwing those terms around.

If I said I don't  wan to date a single mom, and have sex with a woman who has given birth to a baby especially since I don't want my firs tome to be wiht a single mom, it would only be toxic if I DATED a single mom and would refuse sex and treated her like garbage.

If I had gotten a girl pregnant and she said that she wanted to keep the baby despite my reasons and said that I would not have to pay child support and I wasn't on the birth record, and I stayed with her, refused sex and treated her like garbage over it then THAT would be toxic. 

If I dated a girl who was overweight but refused to sleep with her and called her all kinds of names instead of simply not dating her or try to help her become healthy then THAT would be TOXIC.

If I dated a girl from a race or was bi-racial with a race I don't want to date and I called her derogatory names and cheated on her with ""white"" women than that would be toxic. And make me a cheating asshole. 

If I dated a18 year old at 34(age at the time of this writing) or 37 (the other person, I am going to talk about) So what? That does not make one a ""Predator"" or a pervert or whatever. 

There was this woman who was 37 and she was married to a woman who was 18 who did something that she found highly offensive, none of my business what it was but the people in the thread were just bombarding this poor woman with predator accusations based on the age gap alone without even knowing the relationship dynamic. Calling an adult, a predator for dating a younger adult based on age alone is evil full stop. Now if she was trolling around for 18-year-olds to date just because she perceived them as ""easy"" then that would be predatory. That's the definition of a predator. 

I said earlier that since I have never had a girlfriend, I'd like to date someone who is younger and would be objectively more attractive and I threw in the 18-22 range and I got the most insane comments, despite the fact I am not looking for them for any type of easy factor, I have just observed that those ages have the most physically attractive girls. These are legal adults. People vary in maturity at all ages but you would have to actually get to know them in order to see where they are at. 

Apparently it might not make for a ""Lasting relationship"" but why would a 34-year-old who has never dated and does not have a ""career"" or got to sow his oats want to set himself up for a 6-10 or even lifetime relationship the first time around, that's too much too fast and online (Tinder) I expanded my maximum age to 29. 

Those ages 18-29 have the least single moms, the least ""Jaded"" and the least emotional baggage. and most of the girls I have swiped yes to have been white women in the 22-26 years old range. People Panic about age alone without even considering it's the mentality of the people involved that determines whether it is predatory or not. 

If I found a girl who was 18 or even 17 by happenstance and we just liked and respected each other and set up appropriate boundaries and communicated, and decided to wait to do the deed clearly than there's no problem.

Hell to some wanting to have had more than 1 GF before you turn 40 is toxic too, it would only be if i lied to the girl and broke up with her making an excuse instead of being honest that we are not going to be super long term.

Not wanting to be married or have children is also not toxic, regardless of religion.

Never wanting to date your own race is not toxic if you simple are just not physically and emotionally attracted to your race. I simply am just not sexually attracted to black women, I don't harbor any hate and I don't treat them any different than anyone else, and even if I was into all races 99% of the people with the same interests and hobbies and beliefs as me have been white or other anyway and therefore would be on my radar to date.

Plus dating from a closer net type of community is just TOO familiar, and too the same, Its basically like a black version of Shiva baby to me in my community, it's normal to exclusively attracted to opposites, you learn more about the world that way. 

I love girls from Slavic countries with their lilting accents soft round faces and their down to earth despite being drop dead gorgeous demeanor. Apparently, that's toxic too.

Not everyone is a fetishist, predator who needs to sit on a bench, racist, fatphobe, homophobe, transphobe or ageist for who they want to date. You need to stop this shit today.

"Fell for someone and it ended out of nowhere I met someone and we spent 2 mos together - he took me camping with all his close friends, introduced me to his daughter, and would spend every single night during the week at my house for these 2 mos. He told me he really liked me and he met my parents and celebrated my birthday with me. He said he wanted to take things slow, but he was the one who wanted to spend every night together and bring his kid to meet me a few times, and would even leave his dog at my house. I did tell him about a month into it that we should slow down a bit on the time together or else I would get attached but it was going so well so I took his drive to spend time together as a good sign. 

I was having a rough week last week and told him I wasn’t doing so well and needed some support and he pulled away and ended it the next day, stating he was “too tired with his job” and unable to treat me how I deserved. I did try to talk it out and say we could make it work with boundaries and not spending every night together but he ultimately said he made up his mind and left. 

I have started no contact and logically know it is for the better and it wasn’t that long of a connection but I feel like I’m having a hard time because it was going so well and I got so used to spending every single night with him and maybe fell for the potential I saw. Does anyone have any pointers to help move past this person? I just keep thinking of all the good stuff and hoping he realizes what he is losing and comes back.

*I just want to note that I have dated people with kids and I never once pressured him or wanted to take time away from him as a father.

I am big on always wanting to improve: I work out and want to do more, I’m eating healthy and want to be more consistent, I work a lot and try to move up in my career and I’m always working on self-education. I find myself ending relationships because the people I’m dating don’t want or work towards any of these things for themself in a way that I see. I tend to start most of my relationships from online dating like tinder or just social media dm’s. Every serious relationship I have gets to a point where my partner sees us getting married and is head over heels for me, then I realize I don’t see myself marrying them and so I break up with them for that reason and they see it as a complete blindside and end up very hurt and heartbroken.

"No amount of self-work and healing will grant you the love of your life This might be a hot take and not everyone will agree with me, but not amount of self-work, healing and being ""ok"" on your own will bring you the right person for you. 

I'm so sick and tired of hearing all these sob stories like ""I was in an abusive relationship, hopeless thinking I'd never meet someone"" and then after 3 months they meet the love of their lives because ""they worked on themselves and weren't looking"". 

I think also blaming the woman takes away the responsibility of a man - if he's a bad guy: it's your fault because you don't love yourself. 

Not because he's an idiot. Not because he's abusive and needs therapy. Not because he's an overall jerk. It's YOUR fault, because YOU allowed it. 

Now, let's say you find a good guy. You hear how lucky you are and how much you deserve it after all you've been through. It's almost like: good thing you went through all that trauma and abuse so it would lead you to a decent man. 

Instead of: holding men accountable for their actions. 

They'll say when you least expect it, someone shows up. But if you're not expecting it, then how did you allow this person to enter your life in the first person? Surely, a little bit of you was expecting it. I think that's another way of shaming single people who want a relationship, like, ""look at me, if you stopped acting so desperate you'd find your person like I found mine, because I wasn't looking because I'm super indenpendent"". And then you actually look at their relationship and the woman is super submissive or the guy is a door-mat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to stop looking. I've deleted dating apps and I'm currently not talking to anyone. I'm focusing on my goals, I'm spending time with loved ones and I'm taking up hobbies. 

Do you know what's been happening during this time in the romance department? Absolutely-fucking-nothing. You know what that brought me in this time? Two men in already relationships - one of them cheated and I found out later and the other one told me he was in an open relationship AFTER he pursued and kissed me. So yeah, wow. Even when I'm not looking, the trash finds me. 

Now, I'm not the most attractive woman in the world but I'm not bad looking either. I can say with confidence I'm better looking than a lot of other women. I know looks aren't everything, but let's start with that. Apart from that I know I had a lot of qualities. 

Yes I sound bitter, jaded and burnt out. And that's because I am. You can only take so much before you realize all you've been told your entire life is a lie. That going to college won't guarantee a job with good pay, that working on yourself won't guarantee meeting a partner. 

It's purely luck at the of the day. ",Independent_Mix6871,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e4w6n/no_amount_of_selfwork_and_healing_will_grant_you/,1690774039.0,0.87
"I think it's a red flag when a woman doesn't have male friends None of the Flairs matched what I'm trying to say, this is just an opinion.

I know the prevailing theory is often people being jealous and people saying they don't want partners with friends of the opposite sex, but I think it's a little weird when women don't have any male friends. Obviously there are exceptions to everything, and sometimes it may not necessarily just be that she doesnt want to have any male friends, but I think for most people having friends of the opposite sex is healthy and promotes growth and gives you insight from outside of your worldview. 

Personlly, I'd be more turned off by a woman who has no male friends than a woman who has some (not that either would turn me off)

"How to impress her? So I (23m) went out two times with this (21f)girl and it went great. Well at least I thought it went great. We had good time both times but I enjoyed it more on the second date. I made her laugh, we had fun and she’s really nice and gorgeous. We ate ice cream from the same spoon which I found a bit intimate. She told me on the first date that I have an amazing ass but my dumb ass replied “thanks, you have nice hair”🤦‍♂️. She has an amazing ass btw but I was afraid to give any sexual comments. She is very nice, cute and gorgeous. On a second date she told me that my eyes work well with purple colour and I was shocked. Never had so many compliments before. On a game we also had to ask each other some questions and one of them was to guess the colour of the opponent’s underwear. She wore red. We had to hold hands and eye contact was nonstop.she told me that she feels safe with me because I am tall and she’s not. When I texted her for a third date she didn’t reply for two days which made me nervous. On a third day I texted her again if she was alright or if something happened. I told her that I enjoyed our time together but if she didn’t that I would understand, I also asked her how she sees this as I was confused. She replied with that she enjoyed the date too but she is still getting over her last relationship and that she doesn’t know yet if something will happen between us. She also said that she likes the way I behave and that I am nice. She’s up for another date though which I take as a win but her comment kinda made me think that I am not exactly what she is looking for or that maybe I am too nice. I’m taking her on a bowling as she said on the last date that she wants to do something more active and this was also her idea. What can I do to make her attracted to me? How do I impress her? Do I still have a chance with her? Any advice would be nice please.

"Ladies, putting ""I want the bare minimum"" in your description on dating app mean nothing Just like the title say, I just want to give a tip to all women on dating apps. Please don't write ""I want the bare minimum"", not because we don't care about your preference/standard, it's okay. The problem is the ""bare minimum"" mean nothing, it's too unclear for us (men). 

The ""bare minimum"" can mean making 6 figures, be above 6 feet, etc. or just be kind, respectful and honest .

Everybody have ""bare minimum"" so please ladies, don't ask for the ""bare minimum"", ask for what you want in details. It's a red flag when you ask for something, but when we ask you what you truly want you can't give a clear answer.

In resume, it's okay if you have ""standard"" to meet, but be precise about it.

Thank you,

"21 year old male seeking for advice, because he messed it up Hi people, recently I moved into a dorm. I had a girlfriend as well, but we recently broke up (not everyone knows this).   
From day 1 I fancied a girl, not because she was that good -looking, but something was just right about her appearance.  I did not have a chat with her. Last week we went out (she was not there) but I was with a few of her best friends and told them (while drunk) that I wanted to ask her out to the ball and that I found her cute. Her friends were really positive about this idea and said she would 99% surely would say yes.   
The next day a (girl)friend of her told her that she was not keen on it (the girlfriend is a bit into me and jealous) and her guy  friend did not really talk about it but hit on me (I am straight). She definetly knows that I am into her, and I would even say that the people I have told this about told me that I was above her league. Now I don't really know what to do because I 100% sure know that she knows, but I feel a very awkward vibe and we haven't even spoken yet, there is some overlap between our friend groups and sometimes we hang out together as a group.

"Disclose racial preferences up front Ever  realize someone didn’t  want a  serious relationship with you because you’re not white? They see you as fine to date, but they never saw you as someone they would enter into a serious relationship with and eventually marry.

If someone has on their profile they prefer same race or religion, I respect that and don’t consider that discrimation.  It’s understandable you would want to date closer to you in terms of ubringing especially if you are close to your family and are considering kids in the future. My issue is after dating someone and then getting the vibes they just picked you because you fit whatever sterotype and are suppose to be fun.

"Problems of dating So I will talk about the dating life of the current generation and problems of it.
As I know from various  studies young men are having less sex with every year. By some statistics I came to the conclusion that it happens because some small percent of guys are getting the attention of all girls and all the other guys are getting nearly nothing. That top guys who get all the girls get overwhelmed by the amount of options they have and instead of getting a nice long term relationships they start just having one night stands with those girls or having some short term relationships with them just for sex. It results in girls saying that ""all guys are the same"" and ""all they want is sex"", but in reality all the other guys who just want a good healthy relationship can't get it and start hating on girls because of it. Also lots of guys get desperate and start ""simping"" for attractive girls or lower their standards to get at least something. That results in girls ego increasing even more and them only paying attention to top attractive guys which leads us to the start of conversation and gives us the full circle.

Recently I joined Hinge and after weeks of scrolling I found someone I have a lot in common with. My Bio specifically says ""platonic or romantic relationships are cool with me"" and I matched with this person not necessarily being fully attracted to them (because it takes me time, I guess you could say im ""demisexual"") Now we've been texting for a few weeks and she seems to already be interested in me romantically and I DO get a warm sensation and butterflies, I get antsy and flushed whenever she tries to flirt but I'm not sure if im feeling this way because im just excited to get attention from someone my own age or i'm falling in love. We also havent discussed exactly what our relationship is, her profile doesn't specify dating goals/type. So, are we just having fun? Should I go along for the ride?

When I first got in my accident she told me she felt duty bound to look after me like a wife should but after a year or so she was slowly seeing me as a chore and not her husband. She said that not matter how hard she tried to see her husband all she saw was a fragment of the man she once married many years ago. Then she proceeded to tell me the reason she has become so cold towards me is because she has been seeking comfort with another man. She said to me when she started feeling this way she had counselling without me knowing and this led to her confiding more and more with her therapist until she grew fond of him. She told me when she was talking to him about our situation it felt like she was having the same feelings and emotions as to when we first starting dating and she couldn’t help it. They have also been seeing each other outside of their sessions, going for coffee and nice dates. She tells me that she feels free when she is out with him as she doesn’t get the stares or the weird looks she gets when out with me.

"The girl(23F) I’m talking to is hesitant to be with me(23M) because of female friends The girl (23F) I’m talking to is hesitant to be with me(23M) because of female friends

To give some background on our relationship, we’ve been talking for a few months now. We were friends prior to talking, had been for about 6 months before we decided to want to be together. I’ve known of her “toxicity” (she’s told me she’s toxic in her past relationship). Granted part of her toxicity comes her ex who said he had female friends himself and would be flirty with them. He didn’t make her feel secure in the relationship and had him stop hanging out with girls and then, he flipped it on her and had her not hang out with guys or girls since she’s bi. 

Now, up to this point in our relationship, we’ve been good. We offer each other a lot of reassurance and she lives about an hour away from me, but with my work schedule and own tiredness, seeing each other is a struggle at times, but I do what I can to make it work. 

Recently she’s been bothered by the amount of female friends I have. I have respected the boundary she placed on not liking or heart reacting to different girl’s pictures on social media. I hardly bring up any or mention any girls cause it makes her uncomfortable. Now we are at the point of her being hesitant to be with me because of the amount of female friends I have. Given I don’t even really talk to any of them, majority of them. If anything it’s about two or three on any given day. 

I am stuck on what to do now though because I don’t want to have to drop my friends I do talk to, those I’ve been friends with for years and still talk to.  I want to make this work between us but this has me stumped. She will always remain my priority and I don’t know how to have her feel/see that.

My take on the matter was quite different. Although I only had one short two year relationship

Its like when speaking to a women that was attractive I guess my brain stopped processing other woman's looks for that duration so I never had the ""problem"" they had. this is kind of a contradiction but I could appreciate their beauty but it was the same as looking at a painting or the landscape after a hike are the closest things I could compare it to but their wasn't the ""attraction"" they said they have.

"He was late to our date because he was on a different one My (24f) situation is kind of weird or I think maybe I'm just a delusional. I have been casually dating this guy for 5 months not exclusive but when we are together it seems so intense and domestic. We hung out at least 2 times a week ,sleep over, cook together but now i'm starting to wonder if he was sneaking in other dates before coming over and getting into my bed. I feel like he was using me emotionally, comfortability that I was here and can come back to me and play house and still have fun on the side. I just feel so stupid it makes me look stupid for thinking there was some respect(?) or something to not go kiss one girl and then me hours apart. It seems so mean to make plans and be late for them because you double booked yourself. Gotta have every little piece.

"Dating advice Hello people , i hope you all having a great day !

I met this cute girl from instagram and she was near me so we had a chat and i decided to ask her out and we went on a date yesterday , she looked shy at first but we had some nice conversations , i was really hearing her out and i was excited to listen to her..

In these last months im in a need to meet a new person and find something serious and i felt something with her yesterday, im so anxious and her way of talking made me calm and relaxed.. Well , the problem is that as a text person she might reply after 12 hours or just read the message and reply after hours again.. This kinda make me feel like she isnt interested at all , the thing is whenever we actually chat she replies with a decent message and doesnt seem like she is lazy replying.. am i just insecure?

Asking one of the 36 questions to get to know someone better I’m speaking to a girl from a dating app (we’ve been texting) and it’s been a few weeks (we have date scheduled…allegedly) but I feel like I don’t know much about her so I asked if she’s close to her family or friends.

"How do I (M21) get over knowing Im not the better than her (F22) EX at sex? Guys i need alot of help for this one.

This new girl im dating is nice, has all the traits im looking for and we are really compatible atleast for now.

Today after 5 days into the relationship, we had sex and she did say it was awsome and compliments like that. 

But, like an idiot i pressed her if it was the best,  which she admitted it wasnt, nor the best sex nor the best first sex she had with one of her exes. 

Now i know i made a huge fucking mistake asking that but i thought i wouldnt get insecure about it. 

That stuff is now in my head and i know its insecurities but we are both really,  and i mean really into each other,  and she said it doesnt matter and she really did her best reassuring me. But it makes me insecure thinking i wasnt her best first sex in the relationship experience and that i wasnt able to get on that level or if i can even topple in the future the best sex she had.

Now i know this is all stupid but we are quite madly in love with eachother, its the honeymoon phase and it (Mutually) this is like a unique one in a kind, or one in a million relationship where we really clicked almost literally everywhere insanely, so i have the desire to be the best or unique i guess. 

Really need some help cause its been going over my head and i dont want to ruin this relationship.

"WTF is it with guys coming off as interested and then putting in 0 effort to actually make something happened I’ve experienced this before in the past but two different guys recently made me need to come here and rant about this. I (25f) have been “talking” (by that I mean I’ve been on one date with each and they flirt w/me on IG lol i just don’t know what else to call this) that have told me they want to hangout with me again and will always like my pictures, txt me and react to my stories with heart eyes but never actually make solid plans. They will message me saying “let’s hang out soon” or let me know they’re in town and want to make plans but then either cancel on me last minute/never follow through with making plans. WHY?! WTF is the point of reaching out to me and make it seem like they’re interested if they aren’t actually going to do anything about it. The last straw with one of them was when he texted ME first this weekend asking if I was in town for the weekend. I told him yes and asked if he was too. He said yes and asked how long I was staying. I told him how long and then asked how long he was staying. He goes on to say he’s planning on leaving Monday so it was probably the worst time for him to try to make plans. Like okay!? Why tf are you reaching out then. Anyway I was planning on just ignoring him but my friend persuaded me into giving him the benefit of the doubt on him just being a dumb guy and said I should just let him know I’m free today (Sunday) so if he was around we should do something. I figured it was worth one more shot. So I tell him and we plan to get dinner. I wanted to set a time because I usually spend the day with my family on sundays so I wanted to know when I should be free by, he says if it’s okay for him to text me in the afternoon once he’ll know he’s free so I say that’s fine. Guess who got a “don’t think I’ll be able to hangout tonight :/“ text! This clown 🤡. Im mostly mad that I gave this guy another shot after he’s repeatedly either left me on delivered mid convo or has fallen through with plans to meet up. 

Now I’m hesitant if I should even give guy #2 a shot beyond what I already have. We’ve gone on one date and I thought it went great! He was even trying to ask me when I was going to let him teach me how to skateboard and saying “oh we should go x” and spend the day in this town nearby. After the date I didn’t hear from him for a few days which I tried not to overthink it (even tho we had been texting almost every day before the date) an a few days later I hear from him. The problem is the convo was so dry and he took hours in between to respond that I didn’t even see his last text until the next morning and didn’t respond cause the convo was dead anyway. I was going to give up on trying further because I’ll admit I tend to put up very high walls now when it comes to dating because of bad experiences in the past so now if someone isn’t meeting my standards or giving me the same energy I’m giving I move on. I told my therapist about this and she told me that when im in the “gray area” of dating I can’t expect someone to give me 100% and be head over heels over me. To give them some grace. So anyway he ends up swiping up on one of my stories saying we should hangout soon. I tell him when I’ll be back in town and he says okay to txt him and let him know. So once I’m back I txt him and we chat for bit and eventually i say “btw I’m back in town if you’re around we should hangout!” He responds “I’m definitely down to hang, I’m kinda busy the next few days but I’m sure we’ll link before you go back“. ??? I get him being busy but I would think that he would at least TRY to solidify some plans for sometime while I’m here? Am I being crazy in thinking this seems like he’s actually not very interested at all and just dropping this. 

I’m just so sick of the games and stupid bullshit that goes with dating. Like if you want to see me then fucking plan a date man. UGH. Vent over.",Motor_Solid8367,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dyv6h/wtf_is_it_with_guys_coming_off_as_interested_and/,1690756944.0,0.76
"First time in the dating scene and I’m interested in 3 guys at once including my ex and I’m a wreck HELP. (VERY LONG) Im 21 (F) and this guy, I’ll call him Jeff is 23 (M). We met at work back in April when I first started at Amazon when I was having a panic attack trying to learn how to operate the fork lift and my trainer had to grab another trainer which was Jeff, because I was doing so bad. Anyways right when we made eye contact I felt so much tension and connection with him immediately that it was ridiculous. I just chalked it out to him just doing this with everybody because to be honest he’s the most hottest guy at the warehouse. I was also in a 2 year relationship at the time that I was planning to end, but I still held my ground and remained loyal. After Jeff trained me I couldn’t get over him, I was looking for him EVERYWHERE. and everytime i did find him, he was already looking at me, and even approached me to have a random conversation and walked away hinting that he only walked in the area to speak to me. At this point I became Joe Goldberg from “You” and needed to find out his last name in order to find his social media. After hours of looking, I found him and BOOM, he was in a relationship too. I felt like this was gods way of testing me. I followed Jeff, Jeff followed me back, and no further moves were made and I’m Night Shift and Jeff changed to day shift so I stopped seeing him ever since. eventually I did break up with my boyfriend (not because of Jeff) but because of how toxic we were, I fell out of love and felt like I mourned about the ending of our relationship for a very long time he cheated in the beginning and I never got over it and spent the whole relationship letting it eat me up inside and I became toxic as a whole myself. I’ve been feeling guilty about breaking up with my ex ever since because until this day he is still begging for me back. I know I know a 2 year relationship I should spend time to heal right? Nope, met someone else at Amazon, we’ll call him Stan 23 (M) we connected, I began to really like him and been hooking up for months. Stan was infatuated with me while I was in a relationship and I continusly rejected him and when I became single I decided to see what Stan was about. good guy, but immature. doesn’t want to take me seriously because hes too insecure about the amount of attention I get at work that he feels if he did pursue me I would break his heart. so for this, he treats me shitty but I couldn’t help but fall for Stan bc I’m not shit and always attracted to guys who play hard to get. Stan revealed to me recently that I was the second person he’s slept with, I could tell he has severe trust issues and been hurt which I can’t help but understand where he’s coming from in how he treats me. He sucks at texting me back and communicating and for this, it makes me become clingy and emotional. His reasoning for not texting back is because we always talk at work anyway. Problem with Stan, is we been talking for 3 months and Stan has never asked me out on a real date, he only did once when I was in a relationship and i rejected. when I brought this up to him he says he refuses to ask me out on a date because i rejected him in the beginning and i shouldn’t expect him to give me the same energy just because i broke up with my boyfriend. he also says he’s only off on Sundays and uses that day as his rest day but will also be quick to get a day off to hang with friends. he told me once that he doesn’t want to hang out with me more because he has feelings for me but is scared to proceed further. I’ve always tried to initiate us to hangout (which I’ve never done to a guy) and got rejected all 3 times I asked, and rejected by just being ignored or being told he had plans. He proceeds to accuse me of talking and seeing other guys all while trying to kiss and see me on my breaks still to chat. we talk more than we hook up by the way so I don’t think us hooking up did damage. Basically this whole thing became a situationship, in which I feared. I really like Stan, but this week I seen Jeff’s social media and noticed he was single, he began interacting with my post and I slid in his dms starting a conversation about his photography, he ended up giving me his phone number randomly and INSTANTLY asked me on a date to the movies and a restaurant. he was already doing more than Stan. Me and Jeff went on this date yesterday and I know I’m young but I’ve only been done wrong by boys/men most of the time, I’ve always been the one begging and wondering why I’m not good enough. Jeff did everything for me that I only dreamt of that I felt like I was in a simulation. The date was great Jeff consistently spoke about how he couldn’t get over me right when he laid eyes on me, how bad he wanted to talk to me but held himself together since he was in a relationship. He said he never saw a woman and immediately felt like that she was the person he wanted to be with until he seen me, and proceeded to plan a second date with me. Since these two guys literally both work at Amazon I couldn’t help but decide to be honest with Jeff about Stan it was eating me alive the entire date. Jeff actually appreciated this, said it was a green flag that I felt comfortable telling him and told me that he could tell I felt bad about doing it and said he’s done things with people at work too and said “it’s been 3 months and he hasn’t taken you out. I had a 10 hour shift today and work in the morning and still made time for you and we just started chatting two days ago, just think about that. And I’m not telling you this in a “i want you way” I’m telling you as if me and you were friends that If he wanted to make time for you he would have. You need to know your worth” I was expecting to get ghosted and called a slur. instead, I was given an eye opener. Jeff stated that he only wants me and has been sending cute lengthy messages since our date and literally wants to see me everyday. This dude is literally everything I wanted in a guy. I honestly thought people like Jeff don’t exist. I’m a little overwhelmed by how nice he’s treating to the point I do feel like it’s too good to be true and that he’s love bombing me but to be honest I genuinely don’t think he is but I’m stuck between 3 different guys that I’m trying to convince myself bad things about each of them so I don’t make a decision I regret. this is super unlike me as I am very much a lover girl and not the type to entertain 3 different guys at once so that might be why I feel a ton of guilt every single day I wake up and breath. My ex is all I’ve ever known honestly which is the main source of my guilt of having to let him go and see him with someone else would ultimately crush me. but what im doing I know would crush him. I’m honestly stuck between these 3 people and I’m a wreck.

"Was I overdramatic in giving an ultimatum before we even met? Man there really is no guidebook to dating, I don't know what I'm doing at all. 25 F.

I matched with this guy about 3 weeks ago on Tinder, he gave me his snap and number after a couple days and we've been chatting most days since then. Nothing too deep (thought I should leave most of the getting-to-know stuff for the first date), but we have lots of interests in common and talked a lot about video games, DnD, work, and just how are days and weekends have been going, very surface level but he seemed interested enough. Even brought up doing a one-shot DnD campaign with me to show me the ropes as I haven't played much. We had made plans about a week ago to meet up this past Thursday somewhere halfway between us, and he seemed down for it, although maybe slightly apprehensive. 

An hour before I was planning on leaving on Thursday, he messaged saying he had to cancel to go to the Dr for a rash, apologized, and said he'd like to reschedule for the weekend. I made a mistake here in not asking for specifics, and I just said I totally understand, would totally be down for either day this weekend. We chatted maybe once or twice a day since then, I asked how his skin has been healing and he said it's getting better. I considered being more direct about what day and time we could meet but I felt since he was the one who cancelled and is healing, that he would let me know. 

This is where I think I fucked up. He didn't open my message from yesterday all day today (it's now Sunday, the weekend has come and passed, no mention of pushing the date further into the week or anything; he suggested the weekend, never followed up). I don't feel like playing a guessing game or continuing on just surface level chatting with a stranger, so I send him a very kind message just basically saying ""hope you're healing well, wanna let you know I'm leaving it up to you if we meet, I'm still interested but am looking to meet people irl, so if it won't happen or you're not interested I'll be saying farewell. No hard feeling or pressure, just wanted to be straightforward with you."" He opened this a couple hours ago and hasn't responded.

I know this is stupid because we haven't even met and it's just a Tinder match, but I want to know if this was an inappropriate move on my part or if I should have just let it be.

"Matched with someone from my high school but we don't remember each other About 2 weeks ago i matched (on bumble) with a guy and the conversation died out pretty quickly. Fast forward a week ago, i was bored and scrolling on instagram, and found his account, i realised we had quite a lot of mutual followers and most of them were from my co-ed cheerleading team, save for a couple of cheerleaders i met outside of my high school.  
I decided to hit him up on bumble on Monday and ask if he was a cheerleader, and he confirmed it. We then realise that we were both from the same high school and same team but he was 2 years my senior, there were pictures on instagram where both of us were in it, just on different ends of the photograph. Had a good laugh because neither of us recognised or remembered each other, but to be fair, it has been 6 years since leaving cheer and i think both of us looked quite different since. I was also quite introverted and quiet, and he said he was pretty lowkey back then as well. We also don't follow each other on instagram.  
We texted a little everyday since but he hasn't responded to me since the weekend (2 days ago). Kind of bummed out because i was hoping we could've met and thought it would be a funny story or at least interesting to see if we would get along or be awkward, given our ""history"".

"My feelings are in limbo over a girl I feel I can't or at least shouldn't date. So I 22M am feeling frustrated, I'm in a situation where a girl (17) started to show some interest towards me and unexpectedly I've started to catch feelings which I did not expect nor had any intention of doing so.

**(Just to make things clear the legal consenting age in my country is 16 however people can and do feel strongly around this topic both irl and on reddit and so I made it on a throw away account, and to be clear nothing has happened between me and this girl anyways).**

I meet this girl through a mutual hobby. A few months ago I started to see this one girl around the gym about one month into us seeing each other around the gym (we do a combat sport) she started to come up to me and ask if I wanted to partner up with her during training. When I first started seeing her I honestly didn't think much of her at all, to me she was just another person that I would see at training. But once we started to partner up and get comfortable with each other I unexpectedly started to see her in a different way and she started to grow on me and I can't help but feel some kind of way towards her. Every time we train together we're always having a laugh and I genuinely enjoy her presence despite her being far more experienced than I am and often times she shows me up and I be looking like a absolute beginner around her its still fun.

I don't really know what to do because I've been single all my life and recently I've gotten my life together and in the past I didn't ever get any attention from woman and only recently I've been getting some attention from some woman but this girl is the first girl within the last 6 months where a girl has been interested in me and I've had some interest in her back, but of course there's a catch and it's her age.

I feel much more confident and sure of myself and as a result I feel I'm in a position where I would be confident and comfortable with actively pursuing asking for a number and setting a date up with someone that I know has some interest in me but I don't feel comfortable with doing such with this girl due to her age and I'm not sure what the reception would be like from those around me. And so here is where I feel frustrated because I have feelings and I see her and interact with her often but I can't do anything I can't pursue her I can't get her socials or ask out because I don't think it's a good idea and so my feelings are in limbo and what screws with me even more is that there's a degree of hope. This hope comes from the fact that I really enjoy the hobby and the training that I do and I'm sure I'm going to see her long into the future (she's really into it too) and so maybe when she's older there's a chance.

But for now I'm just gonna have to be mature and have my feelings for her remain hidden in limbo and just be training friends and not flirt or make any advances towards her, which fucking sucks. I feel worse too because I struggle with dating and I don't get many opportunities and I do have the thought of ""what if I don't find no one"".  


TLDR;   
A girl likes me and I've started to like her back but she's 17 and I'm 22M and now I feel as if I cant do anything with theses feeling and I'm just gonna have to be friends and nothing more but it sucks because I don't get these feelings often and almost is never mutual. And so its like what am I meant to do with theses feelings I see her all the time and I don't think its a good idea to even think of perusing.",__-Anonymous-_,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15edgsl/my_feelings_are_in_limbo_over_a_girl_i_feel_i/,1690802663.0,0.5
"Navigating dry texting after amazing 1st date I (25f) have been texting with guy (29m) from an app for about a few days. Conversation flowed well and almost immediately set up a date for early in the following week. We meet and things went extremely well, he was super complementary and mentioned several times that he could see this becoming something more. All in all, I think our date went incredibly well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, conversation over text has turned dry since our date but I had chalked it up to having touched many topics when we meet face-to-face. We had texted me good morning and goodnight the past few days since our date, but stopped two days ago and left me on read yesterday after asking how I was. He mentioned he got sick after our date earlier this week but had at least responded once a day to me which is the part that has left me confused.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing he told me was that I was the cutest thing he had seen all week ( in reference to a picture I sent him 24 hours before ) and how he was starting to feel better but spent the day in bed on a Saturday. I was told him about how I was at a concert and the act was running late and that I hope he was feeling better.

Normally, I would just let the guy just dictate how this will play out but that hasn’t worked very well with me thus far.  I’ve never had a real relationship and I feel like I’ve lacked agency in my dating life thus far. I've gone on other dates with guys but never anything that went past a couple dates. Simply living on “If he wanted to, he would” mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don’t want to come off as desperate but I do really like him and don’t connect with many men this way very easily. I wouldn't normally be thinking about one guy so obsessively had he not been calling me perfect and telling me that I can delete my dating apps all throughout our date. Even after, he seemed really into me until our texting suddenly got stale.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to send him a silly meme based on our date/similar interest but now I'm overthinking everything based on a previous reaction to when I sent a silly meme to a fading attraction. I feel so juvenile and I don’t know if my irl friends understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I already know the answer but...any advice? Should I just double text him, send the meme, take the hint, chill out ???

I would ask him to hang out but I'm about to travel out of the country for a week and was hoping we could meet before. :(

"Met a guy I liked and he got a gf :))) Just a little sad.  I dont meet a guy i like often, but I met a really cute and nice guy at a study group about a month ago.  Just casual first meeting, not much convo.  Last week the group had a big party and we had a lot of really great 1 on 1 conversation.  He was always matching my energy. 


 He asked me and another guy if we could all go out to coffee and dinner.  He was always complimenting me, he said I'm like in angel and he even mentioned how interesting the complexity of my natural hair color was.  How it had some red and some gold color and that he thought people would pay top dollar to have my kind of hair.  Teasing me and just being super nice.  I definitely felt like it was flirting, but when the topic came around to dating I asked the both of them if they were dating, and he said he got a girlfriend just last week.


RIP... I told the guy one on one I was honestly kind of into him but I'll clean up my feelings and hope he has a great relationship // I hope we can be good friends.

"Legitimately curious. Really looking at it I think the biggest problem with me dating is that I don't want anything. All of the perks and benefits of having a relationship sound great but like I don't actually want anything from another person so what am I supposed to ask for? It always came up on facebook. Mostly women, some men. What do I want in a relationship? Nothing. So there's nothing to really talk about for them because I don't look for validation from hardly anyone. Online dating became a huge frustrating loop of, not being rejected, but being matched and wanting absolutely nothing from another human being. I have had mental problems for a seriously long time and I've been in and out if therapy to mixed results. The things people say about talk therapy is true, it isn't very effective for people that don't trust the things you say. My first clinic refused to look into PTSD as a possibility. I know I have it now. After online dating I became incredibly jaded and just wanted to be left alone. Almost full social isolation. And in reality nobody else did anything to me. I took a part time job and I get much more social interaction than I used to. I'm realizing again that I'm more skilled with people than I credit myself.

I just don't know what I'm supposed to ask if, emotionally, there's nothing I need to ask for. I've heard worse stories of judgemental behaviour for others online I just have no control over my anger so I get swept up in the adrenaline and ride the high. People treat sex like it's the be all end all of everything ever but I couldn't care less about not having the attention. I hate having attention. It doesn't feel good, it feels anxious. It feels incredibly anxious. So anxious that I stop filtering my speech and start speaking like a madman. I've tried the meds, it just doesn't go away. 

I don't know hardly anywhere I can go where people would really like me. When I talk about things like Elden Ring here there are already people I 100% know they like it. I don't hardly want to talk about my hobbies with anyone in the world which means I don't want to interact with anyone either.",Reavere312,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ecq1p/legitimately_curious/,1690800453.0,1.0

Recently, he told me that he feels comfortable attempting to have sex with me for the first time since he’s been trying to “save for the right one” but once we tried it out, he immediately felt uncomfortable and said that’s enough. He told me that he wanted everything to be perfect and that it didn’t feel as special to him because he keeps thinking about my past lovers knowing that I have already done these kinds of things before when he hasn’t.

"Being a ""slow"" man...and wanting to fix it. I'm writing this after breaking up from a longer relationship and almost two years of being sort of miserably single: I'm not gonna lie. I should not have a problem meeting women. And I don't. I meet lots of women. I'm a tall, above average looking dude who owns a successful business in a creative field (32M). I have good fashion sense, I'm fit and like the outdoors, surfing, skiing, sailing, etc. I play in a band, I have a masters degree, a nice apartment in the centre of my city and have a lot of friends. Me writing this opening might piss some people off but it's relevant to discuss my situation I think. I live a happy life in almost every aspect, business is good, exciting creative projects are happening, but my love life is miserable. So what's the problem?

Women get frustrated with me. Or confused. They think I'm slow. I grew up with a lot of female friends so hanging out talking to girls come natural to me. Maybe too natural. I meet women, either through friends, social events, work or they just come up and strike a conversation at a café or a bar or whatnot. And I respond. I like people so it's almost always a good time. The point of confusion happens after a while... contrary to what my bragging opening paragraph might signal I'm naturally a quite polite and humble person. I feel comfortable around women but I don't naturally code them as sexual partners. They might be a new friend. Or a new business partner. Even when I meet someone that I find attractive and might give me signals of interest my brain is slow when it comes to get into the mindset to make a flirty move and take the conversation from friendly to intimate or flirty/sexual. I typically want to hang out with someone two or three times before I'm there. I've come to understood that women get frustrated (several women I've had relationships say so, *""yeesh, lucky for us I was patient, I didn't know if you even wanted me"" – my ex*) because I'm so slow. My experiences this past year is that the women I meet seem to except something else. Something quicker. Faster. Maybe it's my background that might lead them to expect a more aggressive behaviour. I'm not slow in business. I'm successfull in leading big projects with difficult people and I'm not a pushover. But something is different when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. That's another side of me.

I was just crushed because a beautiful girl with similar interests and a great mind that I like a lot ghosted me after our first real date. We've known eachother for 6 months through a working project where she came in and consulted. We had a strong connection and from the moment we met I understood she liked me. She would look deep into my eyes with the prettiest smile and come around and say hi when she didn't have to. It was clear that there was undertones of sexual interest. However, because we worked together and had a great collaboration going I didn't want to f\*ck that up and be unprofessional, so I waited until when the project was over before I asked her out. We had a great time and hung out for a whole day until late night, just winging it, doing various fun summery things around town and talking about life, ending up with a dinner and wine. When the time was late I called it a night, followed her to the subway and got that long hug where I felt that she wanted me to do a move. She did not want to let go. But I wasn't there. I wasn't ready. I asked her out again after a couple of days and I was sad to realize she's been ghosting me since. It frustrates me. It hurts me. I really like her and I feel like i dissapointed her. She's progressive but I know she likes conservative gender roles and I think she might've wanted someone more aggressive. She might've thought that I was someone else. Someone more like I am at work. I mean it might be something completely different, she might be in love with someone else or whatnot, she might've just used me for business reasons and wanted to see if I was down to f\*ck, but this happens over and over again so it's not just one case. I've met so many women after my break-up that I like and my brain picks up might be open to something more but by the time I'm there and am ready to explore it more they've already lost interest or misinterpreted me as not interested back. She's not the only one, there's been many other situations similar like this but she was extra special to me.

I don't have a straight question here but rather wanted to share my frustration and hear what you guys have to say, women and men. I guess there are bigger questions here as well about whats expected from men and women and gender roles in society and flirting. Do you have to be the one who makes the aggressive first move as a guy? I don't think ever a girl has kissed me first. I might point out that I live in a Scandinavian country so flirting is a bit more lowkey here than in some other places. It also might be that I hang out with too many women who have a certain view of successful men and how they ""should"" behave...they might be attracted to power or status and associate other character traits when it comes to flirting than I have. I'm open for critique and to hear that I'm all wrong:) I'm afraid that I will miss out on romance in life if I don't change and pick up on things faster. I want to fall in love with a nice person and have kids. What do you think? I'm considering trying to brake my pattern and force myself to try and be flirty quicker than what I would usually feel is ok when I feel it's wanted from the other person...but I think it will feel really unnatural to me. We'll see. Hit me with your thoughts.",mrcsrnne,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dtydn/being_a_slow_manand_wanting_to_fix_it/,1690745095.0,0.94
"Should i keep waiting? So, we met each other like a week ago already and since the beginning she directly said she liked me, etc

But she barely answered like, she talked to me a few minutes, and then she dissapeared the whole day until the next day near the same hour

Then she never answered back, until i asked her if she still wanted to talk (She answered a few hours later almost night), she like i said still acted extremely interested in what we could become together and said she's been really busy lately and she can't answer but that she promises me she won't let me go and doesn't want to stop talking, she told me that on Tuesday but hasn't answered since then after we talked a bit

So, i don't know lol Maybe i'm just fucking stupid and I'm just making things up to think she doesn't wants to talk (I have anxiety so, maybe that's why lmao)

"He lied on the first date So I’ve been seeing this guy for two weeks now (M32 &amp; F28), and recently I found out that he told a little lie on our first date. I don’t really remember much from this conversation, but apparently I asked him how long he had been single for and he told me it had been a few months. 

Yesterday we were talking about past relationships and I find out that he actually just became single a week and a half before we met. It was just a short 5 month relationship that wasn’t super healthy by the sounds of it - so that part doesn’t bug me at all. What does bug me is the fact that he lied about the timeline so the truth wouldn’t scare me off. 

I’ll admit it’s kind of an awkward question to be asked on a first date (especially when you’re as newly single as he is), but I’m looking for something serious and longterm, so I often ask serious questions. 

He has since explained the situation to me entirely, admitted he lied and apologized a million times. We have had a lot of open communication about it, but it still really bugs me that he lied. I’m a super honest and open person and desire to find that in a longterm partner as well. Things have been going amazing with this guy otherwise, but I’m currently taking a few days to process this. 

What do y’all think? Let it go and keep seeing him? Or not worth the risk of more lies in the future?",General-Champion-377,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e1vnm/he_lied_on_the_first_date/,1690765073.0,1.0

"Got a date with someone I already talk to a lot Alright so I (m18) matched with this guy (m21) on tinder. We hit it off straight away with getting to know each other, a couple weeks after that we moved onto a different  app and started calling and playing games with each other every day for the past month, other than when he went on holiday for a week which for me was a test to see if he would still put effort into talking to me whilst he was gone, which he did! He would constantly send me pics of what he was doing and let me still be apart of his life. We would continuously flirt with each other and some calls could be going on for almost 10 hours. So I thought I’d take the risk and ask him on a date, he said yes and now we have a date next week!! The problem is when I meet him what if I don’t know what to say because we are so used to talking about the games we are currently playing together. I’ve written a list of things to talk about like, what he did in college, what’s his dreams are and what he wants to do. But I can’t picture myself saying that in a natural way and I’m scared It’ll sound forced and awkward 😭

This is the first time I’ve gotten into a mlm relationship and I know we like each other alot (we have literally said to each other that we find each other really attractive and that we like each other’s personality and that he would love to date me) so I really don’t want to screw this up!!!

"Fiance going to bars- am I controlling? Also venting. I know a couple of languages and English is not my first language. Sorry in advance. 

I'm so sorry for venting but also need advice if im being controlling or what is going on with me. my girl n I had a agreement on no guys(4 her) no women 4 me. and no bars or strip clubs for any of us. Unless couple friends/co workers ect. She's also bipolar and has had a rough road of abuse in every way and being or ending homeless  as well as being a pushover and being taken advantage- I lost her for half a year in the streets of Oakland due to going in Mania...anyways going back to the main story. 

She met online a women and met at a bar which led to meeting another person from 4pm all the way to almost 4am in the morning she disregarded time and boundary we set tohether with excuses and her stories are not well constructed she kept talking to me about being at the girls house and she keeps saying he between the convos and so I said who's he? You keep saying he. Basically, she confessed that she was talking to guys only at the end before she left that woman's house. They were supposedly walking in as she was leaving and they over heard her talking about anime. She got extremely mad at me for asking who's he and how everything happen with he and started screaming at me, saying I ruined her night and she was so happy. Also she said she told them that im a big anime watcher so they know she was with someone but only after i asked questions. threaten me that she can't be with someone like me and that those are her new beasties. Something I learn about this new friend of hers she hangs out is that she goes to bars to pick up younger man and take them home. They even aperently pick up some guys at safeway that they remember from the bar(her new friends) And even today, she still trowing it to my face bringing it up, saying and getting mad at me and yelling at me, belittling me and threatening me with leaving and breaking my stuff or pc- I'm a gamer. 

Little more about me. I'm extremely patient and I try to speak with care and understanding now I do suspect that maybe she's heading towards mania. Last year when this happen she started to be  narsaccist- bunch of gas lighting and I thought it could he because of stress and being drugged by people she trusted.
 The reason why I am talking about this is because 

1. vent. 
2.you guys might have pointers in what direction I might take since there's wiser people out.

I did like one thing- she kept updating me and calling me throughout the day at the bar which I find weird- even call me if she can talk to a guy who was autistic and in a wheelchair.  but the only thing I asked her to do was to let me know when she got to said places fine with a address incase something happens to her. 

She did call me and invited me to come at like 2am when I was asleep and need to get up early at 6am. 

Also we agreed she was going to ask her docs if she can drink with taking meds for her bipolar. Which she never did when I asked her today.

Update for people who don't know the past and / or what's bipolar. There are different kinds, but one of them is hypermedia.

One. Her due to trust issues. But it's not even me either her whole family and the docs/ therapist tell her that she shouldn't be going out late nights or partying. She has a history of hyper mania. If you don't know what that is. Imagine this. She feels like she's God. She can walk in the street in front of cars. Fight people or even beat up her own family. And or one time, she said she was on fire in the middle of the street burning. When it was all on her head. 6 months straight of this. Being in the streets being raped
 Beat up and traumatized all because she wanted to have fun and smoked some weed, which was laced and trusted a dude. A drug that made her go into a mania episode. I wish it would be a week or a month, but no. I had to leave my job to go find her in the streets day and night. She kept getting out of the mental hospital because they thought she was just a druggy I had to fight with court to make her owned by the state, so she gets forced treatment. I'm just referring to why I'm a bit off. BTW, she just told me I'm not allowed to go bars because I could do something out of spite. Wtf????

"Have I been played? I'm a 17F and talking to the 17M i met approximately 4 months ago. He would be very engaging from the beginning, on text, in real life etc. We continued to go out but there would be times his behaviour would be cold or distant. But this would quickly go away and he showed large signs of affection (kissing my forehead, holding my hand, more subtle ways to be affectionate). He even seriously wanted our parents to meet and me to go over to his place etc but I felt uncomfortable. We weren't dating though it was kind of like an affectionate friendship that seemed a bit like a relationship. There were some times he insinuated making what we had ""official"" but I kind of brushed it aside because I wasn't ready for that yet. 

When I last saw him 3 weeks ago he gave me a letter, before i went overseas, where he confessed that he believes that he is in love with me and it were the kind of love where he wouldn't mind spending the rest of his life with me. I also sort of brushed it aside but insinuated that I felt something back but never a clear response.(He simply insinuated he would wait) And since then, he hasn't been texting the same at all, even taking 15 hours to respond when he isn't even busy. And when I fail to respond he doesn't even bother. He completely seems to have lost interest in 3 weeks of me being overseas but it seems he still wore my hairband around his wrist when he goes out.

He said no and hung up in my face because that made him upset then proceeded to think I’d want to still have sex with him . He called me weird and cringe for laughing and being my awkward self . I have anxiety and I’m anxious. Since I do that he tried to say it had something to do with maturity. Of course I’ll awkwardly laugh if you’re ignoring me and I’m awkward anyways . He hurt my feelings and then brushed it off like it was nothing. Keeps begging to have sex since I won’t he doesn’t wanna talk or call.  Dry and one word responses.

"I am terrible at showing affection or expressing my emotions, and I'm scared I might ruin my relationship. I've only been dating my current girlfriend for a month now, but I'm completely in love with her. I get excited every time I see her, and I love every minute we hang out or go on dates.

On our third date, when I made things official, she told me a little more about her perspective about the relationship. She's been interested in me for a while, since we first met, and every time we make plans, she always tells me that she's fine with anything, as long as we're together.

The problem arose around last week, when we went out for coffee. I had met her parents just before, and I got along very well with her whole family; however, when we got coffee, she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that I always seem emotionally distant. She also told me that she didn't know if I really liked her, and that I never talk about how I feel.

Growing up, I never showed or received much affection from anyone. I had trouble socializing with people, and I never really had the chance to talk about my feelings, so I learned to just keep everything to myself. I have a habit of bottling up my emotions, and not asking for help with anything. If ever anyone does ask me whats wrong, I just say ""I'm fine"" and move on. I've never told anyone I loved them, and I haven't hugged anyone in about 10 years, including family members. 

This has made many people angry with me, and I tend to not really care, until I met my current girlfriend. I want to tell her that I love her, but I don't know how. I want to show her that I care, that I like her, and I want to be open with her about my feelings, but I have no clue what I'm doing, and I don't want to lose her.

"Why do Women Expect Commitment in this Day and Age? Been watching videos and shorts about women ranting that men are afraid of commitment. Hmmm.

So, we now live in a world where ghosting has become an accepted norm for people to end relationships. No matter the depth of that relationship. And women are the biggest users of this tactic by far. And women are more likely to break the relationship. And they are more likely to invoke frivolous reasons (because Barbie??). And now men are being coached, by women, to just move on and get over it.

"Should I confront him or let him wonder? So my boyfriend or ex who knows(we have been in an official relationship for a while) has gone on vacation with his male friends and hasn’t reached to me during this holiday which has been 10 days (he is back today). Before he went we had an argument and met 1 day before he went and seemed to have evened things out. I’m actually on vacation in Dubai now too, booked it last minute after he went. We didn’t talk so he didn’t know until he noticed on social media and I think in this case he deserved it. As you see, it’s not easy to mess with me lol He booked us vacation next week so I’m wondering if I should cut to the chase and ask what’s up or shall I just wait and see how long it takes him to reach out?

How do ppl just casually date and not get their heart broken? I was talking to this guy for a week and I know its gonna sound insane like I have menatl issues but he was special ok the only one I ever connected to on an app like that...and he said the same to me. We talked all day everyday about everything including trauma and family issues which obvisley made us feel close as well normal things. Maybe I wasnt in love but I think i was starting to fall for him. But he ghosted me and it shattered my heart he disnt even say I'm not interested anymore. Tbh he had a fair reason.....I just ended my past situationship 2 days to matching with him and I told him I wanted to get tested for stds first just to make sure before meeting him.....I thought I was being responsible but the thought that I might have something turned him off so much he ghosted me. He was special I dont talk to  others on the app like that the convo is more surfacey. But regardless it seems most or alot of ppl just jump into a new realtionship every few months and idk how ppl can do that without having their heart ripped out. Maybe it's me but I dont feel safe with anyone so I only let a select few even know me for real I guesse so when things end (even by my choice) it hurts so much.  I dony understand ppl who date 20 or 30 ppl? Like do u not open ur heart just hang as friends and hook up then walk away?

Who else could shed light on young adult dating behavior than a bunch of random redditors, so here goes. Son #1 was supposed to go out on a date with a girl he met last weekend while out.  Today I asked where he was taking her, and he tells me she has ghosted him. He was still waiting to see if she responded up until around 4:00, but she never did.  He is 24 years old and lives in a major city.  I think this has happened before too. I’m just trying to understand why this happens? Obviously she was interested enough to share her phone number.  I’m wondering if she somehow got scared because she doesn’t know him?  Is it that he asked her out too soon? What could it be?

"Anyone feel like dating is too fast paced? I might just be naive, I'm 26M never had anyone (I'm quiet, don't like going out etc) and just got rejected after a couple dates and talking for a bit over a month, hung out a few other times.

I just feel like from reading lots of articles and posts/comments that people don't give anyone the time or effort to get to know one another. Maybe I'm just not a good people reader but I feel 1-2 dates is not enough unless of course there is an immediate reason to not see this person anymore. 

Another thing is the ""spark"". I feel like people are going around only focusing on feeling that immediate connection, looking for instant gratification and focusing on the reasons to not date them. Again, people have every right to do this but I feel dating apps/society/movies have given people unrealistic expectations of partners because they can just simply message the next person on their phone. But saying that, I can understand that people don't want to waste time. But then again, I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.

She told me she felt safe and comfortable and that I was a breath of fresh air for once and said I'm an awesome person etc. We had some things in common but she didn't feel a strong spark so we should just be friends. I respect that but I just don't really understand it. Like, why not try and build a connection and look for reasons to be with this person until the reasons to not date them overwhelm those. Try and make you're own spark and build your own fire, because I feel like that is way more beneficial down the track if things get rough because you can fall back on your core values of what you built together rather than falling back on nothing but infatuation.

That's just my 2c anyway. Maybe I just don't understand females or I just don't have enough emotional trauma to understand people these days and my soul is a LOT older than I am 😂 I can say I tried dating once now so I'll go back into hermit mode for a while and maybe try again in a few years",Mundane-Astronomer61,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e4a6w/anyone_feel_like_dating_is_too_fast_paced/,1690772142.0,1.0

"(32m) Last 4 women have each ended it with me after at least one date with some variant of ""can't be in a relationship right now"". What am I doing wrong? I've been looking for a long term relationship, but I keep finding myself in this situation where the woman says she's realized she's not looking for that.

Please tell me what I'm missing or doing wrong, what I need to fix because while they have all been very polite and thoughtful in ending it and I'm surprised and grateful they haven't ghosted me because it seems so common online. The theme of them expressing a disinterest in pursuing a serious relationship is making me wonder: **what the hell it is I'm doing wrong so consistently?** (and why is it so obvious to four different women, but not myself).

It's been after after a date with no kissing, after going to bed together on the second date, after going to bed multiple times - all different. So it's not like ""they just used you for sex"". There's no pattern, it's not like there's a behaviour or action that I've done that I can point to that makes it clear - ""ahh it's when I said this obviously egregious thing"". They all had different professions, different ages. Some there were hours of phone calls before the first date, others it was just messaging then date.

Here's the kicker though: I met all of them on Hinge, the dating app that markets itself for something more serious. How's that for irony?

The only possible common denominator left is **me** : but they have all been at pains to soften the blow with the classic ""it's not you it's me"". But 4 times in a row? Come on. Twice is a coincidence. Four times is a failure on my part.

I am honestly clueless as to what personality flaw or behaviour I'm exhibiting that is at the root of this.

In the interest of producing context but at risk of flattering myself, the only possible explanation I can fathom is these women were on dating apps without the intention of actual commitment in the first place? I base this on the fact that one of these women literally said to me in what sounds just too flattering to be true that she was ready to delete Hinge because her career was taking up too much of her time and she didn't want anyone in her life, but then I managed to grab her attention and she (with some goading from her friends) decided to see if she could make it work. But... obviously, she couldn't. If that's true I interpret that to mean I'm quite simply looking in the wrong places, which begs the question of: okay, where are the right places?

The bottom line is I'm trying to look at this as an opportunity to improve and develop further as a person. Of course I have flaws, but I don't know what is the root cause here, and therefore I'm unable to take meaningful steps to fix it - despite being eager to do so.

"Types of ✨men✨ So we’ve all heard of Schrödingers cat right? That experiment? I think all of us studied about it when we were in school, no? 

But here’s the thing, it’s not JUST a cat. Confused? Let me give you an example using the world of ✨dating✨.

Now for those who are straight, Bi, gay or anything but a lesbian, Cis-het men is usually a category one comes across.
But in this category, there are various sub categories (kinda like the various voice modules in my head that are narrating what I’m writing, but that’s not really the point). Here are the sub categories:-

1. Fucboi - naam hi kaafi hai. Sab ko use karte  hai like baap ke Diya credit card. Who cares if the damage done is higher than the damn credit card bill? At least I have given myself some self care and confidence Na 👀. They will use anything and everything to get you hooked to them. And like a fresher who has just scored their first job at corporate they’re supremely adjustable depending on what they think will help them land their target. I say target because at this point we’re nothing more than a bulls eye for them. You hit the bulls eye, someone calls you daddy and then your inner Ariana Grande comes out screaming thank you next.
2. Case study : these are the men whom we talk about on group chats, with our best friends, when we catch up over drinks and then psychoanalyse the fuck out of them because daaru k baad toh bc hum hi Freud ka protégé hain. Now here’s the thing. These men could be the bestest creatures we’ve ever known OR they’re the red flags 🚩 who inspire the commandments of the sisterhood. Does he only text you after or at exactly 2:00 am saying wyd or I miss you or u up? Behen he’s a laal jhanda. At that point other than his hormones and PP are the only things up. He’s going to go back to ignoring your existence and gaslighting you because if his loins are on fire then everything around him, including you, needs to be on fire. Does he send you a text apologising for the lack of responses because it’s been an overwhelming day and he wants to make it up to you by coming over with your favourite take away and watch your favourite movie? RUN STRAIGHT INTO HIS ARMS AND STAY THERE. &gt;insert pedro pascal’s voice&lt; he’s got you babygirl.
3.  Oedipus or Mumma ka sher: door se Bohut hard. MC Sher ko bhi kha jayenge. Bhagwan Kaun? Apun hi Bhagwan hai. BUT MUMMA KI PHONE AAYI TOH PHATA HUA BALLOON KA TARAH SAB HAWA GAAND SE NIKAL JATA HAI. Honestly, I’m surprised he’s not married to his mother. You think his Desire to be squeezved between your boobs is because he’s attracted to you but NO it’s actually because it reminds him of the times he’s been breastfed by his mummaaaaaa.
4. Men written by women: these are the boys/men who genuinely understand the “basics”. They don’t boast about the fact that they LET you pick the restaurant. They don’t tell their friends that they LET you wear the clothes you wear. They’re the men who help you with your with the pleats of your saree, enthusiastically take part in skin care routines with you, aren’t afraid of being vulnerable around you. They’re the kind who normalise being called a feminists, they use their privilege to call out locker room talk, they don’t tolerate that shit. They remember your favourite coffee order or pastry or kfc order and the likes. And boiiiiiiii can I tell you is that a turn on. Like respectfully Sir, you have permission to rearrange my biological being with junior. Thank you very very much. No, honestly it would be my HONOUR TO BE REARRANGED LIKE THAT.

And FINALLY the best for last.

5. ✨Schrödingers Chutiya✨ : they’re dangerous. Not the you need to get a restraining order dangerous. But the “make you fall for me and now you’re unconsciously rearranging your life around me but imma still not date you” dangerous. If there were a traffic signal, you’d see all the damn lights on. They love living in plausible deniability. It’s always 5 steps forward and then ten steps back. One minute you’re all consumed with their love and 🌶️ spicy🌶️ talk, the next minute y’all are still talking but the love ain’t the same they get weird if you bring it up. And the thing is no matter how many times you tell yourself no more, they know EXACTLY how to wiggle their way back in. They don’t come to get their dick sucked or stroked. They’re here just for the way you fawning over them makes them feel. Who needs to buy a gaslighter or match box to put your stove on when these fuckers exist? And whenever you ask then for clarity, they’re always lost and can surprisingly never remember what you’re talking about. “I didn’t mean it that way babe” oh really? Then what did you mean when you said you didn’t want to hook up anymore but when when you met me again you were stroking my thigh, Karan?! ARREY BC TERE VAJE SE MEREKO STROKE HONE WALI HAIN! Tu na hai ghar ka Na ghat ka. Yeh Na 50 shades of Grey Nahi, infinity Shades of Grey hai. Black, White, Rainbow, none of these colours exist in their life.

"Advice needed Just looking for some guidance

Hi! 

I (25f) have been seeing a guy (28m) for about 3-4 months now. Neither of us were looking for anything series. We agreed friends with benefits. Welll… we’ve grown super close and things are going great. We do date things and have a really good time. 

He is in a sticky situation because he still lives with his ex(their lease ends this month). He stays over my house probably 6/7 days a week. I’m worried that he’s just staying with me right now because he’s in this situation. I’ve mentioned how I’ve developed some feelings for him and he admits he does like me and cares about me but he’s just always been in a relationship and they’ve all ended terribly. 

He just says “I’m not ready for a relationship right this second.” Which my ex also put me through hell so I understand and I can’t imagine still living with them. 

Idk I just don’t want to waste time. I see posts like “if he wants to he will” but after being through some traumatic shit I don’t think it’s that easy. 

The other night he was drunk (which I know 🙄) and he called me and talked to me for 2hrs about how he wants me to be his girlfriend and how he wants me to meet his family but he just doesn’t know if he can handle another split from everything again. The next day I asked if he remembered our convo and he said ya some if not most. And I asked him about specific things and he was just like well ya I care about you and I love spending time with you I just don’t want to fuck everything up. 

Idk I mean there’s some more details but that’s the bulk 🤷🏻‍♀️

"Should I apologies even though I did nothing wrong ? So I’ve recently gotten myself into trouble with this girl I work with. She’s pretty new only been work there a few weeks and I thought she was pretty cute things is she’s kinda young 18 to be exact snd I’m 24. I personally don’t see that to be a big deal and truth be told not sure if that’s the main source of the issue but that’s my best guess as to why things are the way they are en.

Anyway I got her snap shot her a few texts but I didn’t shoot my shot at all up to this point I was still trying to feel things out so that I wouldn’t end up in a situation just like im in now. Anyway I ended up sending her something along the lines of the following “ yea we really didn’t get to talk much at work especially since it got so busy.do you live in the area ?” I had actually said the name of my home town which I just changed to in the area for obvious reasons. Anyway she took that ad me implying or asking her out which I wasn’t actually trying to do or imply and I quickly told her that after she just swiftly rejected me for sending her that. So I got rejects without even shooting my shot 😭 that’s fine tho but since then she’s made things very awkward at work.

I've got over it alot but bits of me still miss him I need to fully let it go I need advice plz. 

So its kinda a crazy siatiatuon I just ended my previous situationship 2 days prior after being sexual assaulted and abused......i said I'd never have unprotected sex unless married but he did it while i was not sober. I was then dealing with fear of pregnancy and stds idk why i went back to tinder to distract my mind I guesse but we connected so intensely after a week I had to tell him it wasnt the right time I have to get tested for anything after being assaulted by this person I've only known a month so not that well. He ghosted me which I get nobody wants to put their own health at risk for somone they've know so short its alot. I dont blame him but I do think ghosting Is cowardly like just say I'm sorry I'm not comfortable with that espailly after all wr shared :/  I also feel stupid for going to him for emotional support I know it was stupid but in the moment I was going through so much trauma i didnt kmow what to do. I guesee i feel stupid and shame myself so much even tho I was in trauma mode.

"How to get over a past f-up? \*Throwaway account

I recently reached 30 (male, btw), and up until now I have never been in a serious relationship. There were a few casual dates here and there, but nothing too serious. I also was really focused on my studies (10 years to get an undergrad, but that's a story for another time), and dating always has been an afterthought for me. Also, no ""this is the one"" moment for any of the women I've met.

On top of all that, I had a big f-up that no one knows about; I got scammed into masturbating in front of a camera in front of a girl I met online, then whoever was behind the camera began to blackmail me. Thankfully I mamaged to bring everything under control within a few hours, without no one really seeing my dick pick.

I feel so ashamed, humiliated, and angry over what has happened. It has also definitely made me less trustful of others. As in, I can't trust anyone to open myself up, as well as not trusting myself to being honest to what has happened to anyone unfortunate enough to date me.

So as the title says, how do I get over a past f-up, and learn to trust myself and others? There's this girl (29f) that I've met at volunteering and I find her to be an amazing person, and I am crushing on her pretty hard. I of course try not to be too obvious or look like a creep about it.

I feel I can get the courage to ask her out (remember, no serious relationship before so I am sloppy at this), but my past fuck-up seems to be holding me back",MiddlePop,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e590a/how_to_get_over_a_past_fup/,1690775205.0,1.0
"Obsessives thoughts and intense negative feelings after one date, am I okay? Hello, I (28M) am writing this because of a dating situation I just went through and would like some advice/feedback in order to alleviate the feelings of worthlessness I often experience after I am rejected.

A few months ago I moved across the county to a city where I know nobody. It's a great career move for me but I need to start my social life from scratch. I've talked to some people in my apartment complex and made some friends. One of them invited me to a kickball league and I met a girl on the team. She DM'd me via GroupMe a few days ago, clearing indicating interest. I asked her out the next time we had a kickball game and we set up a date for the following day.

The date was great, I had a great time and I am confident she did too. We ended up having sex at my place, which in hindsight is where I think I made a mistake. Due to insecurities in the past I do not have a lot of sexual experience. I had a girlfriend for about 6 months in college, where we had sex frequently. I also did some casual dating about a year ago and only had sex once during that time. Outside of those two situations I haven't been having sex. Since I am relatively inexperienced I think I may have fell short of her expectations.

I tried to set up a mini golf date for this evening, and she gave me a maybe, recently followed by ""I don't think I've got it in me tonight"" and no attempt to reschedule which I read to mean she has no interest in going on another date. Her best friend is on the team so I may ask her if I should just assume we'll be friends from her on out, but I am for sure getting the vibe that she doesn't want to see me again. 

Ever since our first date (Tuesday) I have been thinking about her nonstop, obsessing over whether or not she wants to see me again. When she finally gave me the bad news I felt like I didn't want to live anymore. I am just crushed. A big part of the reason I am so inexperienced in dating and sex is because of the intense feelings this sort of rejection would induce in the past. 

I know it's perfectly normal to be upset in this situation, but I would really, really like to stop the obsessive, intrusive thoughts. I don't think its normal. It's only been one date and I can hardly focus at work. I go to bed and wake up thinking about her. She's on my mind when I am working out, watching TV, and playing video games with my friends. I feel like a desperate loser for putting this much attention and emotional energy into a person that I barely know. We get along and had one good date and we had sex once. That's it.

I have a great career, I am fit, and I am successfully developing a social life in a cool city where I don't know anyone. On paper, these things seem like a great successes and I should be proud of myself. On the inside I continue to feel desperate and unlovable. I can't seem to help but allow women to dictate my self-worth and command my attention. I tell myself that I shouldn't let somebody I hardly know control my self esteem, but my brain continues to obsess and I don't know how to make it stop.

Is this a common experience or am I mentally ill? Does anyone have any advice for me? Am I a complete moron for sleeping with her on the first date? I probably should have focused on developing an emotional connection first given that it's unlikely I'll be able to blow her mind in the bedroom without more experience. Is it always a bad idea to have sex on date #1 if you think you want a deeper connection?

Any advice is appreciated. I am happy to provide more information if it would help. Thanks for reading.

"Trying to see where things go again for the 4th time in almost 2 years (20M,21F) Before I get into the meat And potatoes of this connection, let me give some context. For one, he is in the military, the army, to be exact. We started talkin briefly after I had to put my dog down. When we met, he was separating from his now ex-wife. There is a child involved. 

We met during the week of December 2021, going into New Year's 2022. We were both young 19-year-olds. I had my apartment and car at the time, and he was a young careless private. We did meet on Tinder, of all places, and instantly clicked over text. Not too long after, we FaceTimed, and oddly enough, I thought we would stay friends cause we clicked so well. Soon enough, I drove 40 minutes to the base to meet him for the first time. I was anticipating just hanging out and wasn’t nervous at all. Then his 5’11 buff built self came in.  We locked eyes, and my entire body was stunned. He felt familiar. There was a spark, for sure.
I let him be my passenger prince and play music. We pulled up to my place and ate the pizza, he put on one piece, and we were lying watching the movie. One thing led to another, and we were two young 19-year-olds fuckin like bunnies. From there, a very intense, lust-fueled, and passionate relationship blossomed. The conversations were in-depth, diverse, and intriguing. The sex was great. Overall was a great addition to my life and company. I’d like to have around for a while. Keep in mind while this was all happening, he was divorcing his wife. He also wasn’t able to see his at the time one-year-old daughter. I would ask here and there how he felt about it, but he never liked talking about it too much. I didn’t want to prick and pry, so I left it alone. By the end of the month, his divorce was about to be finalized. Based on how we discussed things, I thought we were building something for it to be official in 5-6 months. Boy, was my little mind wrong lmao. He slowly started to pull away. I began chasing.
By my birthday, I ended up cussing him out over text and blocking him cause he couldn’t reach out and say anything. I was crazy and called him from a burner number, and he instantly answered. I know that is mature of me… I left it alone. I was heartbroken because I felt like he had ghosted me on my birthday. I was fine for a few months, and then I reached out again in April of ‘22. He apologized for doing what he did and said he didn’t do the arguing, so he just pulled away. Plus, his divorce was a lot on him.  I was understanding. I was going to let him come over again, but he ended up flaking again. I ofc got mad and blocked him because he buttered me up, got NSFW vids, and dipped. I stopped fw with him for damn near the rest of the year, but after him creeping into my mind again, I reached out in December of ‘22. By this time, my car was long totaled (not my fault), and I moved back in with my family as I couldn't afford to live alone. This time his depression was apparent. He said he felt numb daily, but I made him feel something. He was sorry for everything he did to me, but he wasn’t in the space to give me what I wanted, but in the future, he did. He said he missed me and that I didn’t deserve all that he did to me. We had sex in his car that night, and then he was off to Korea. While he was in Korea, I tried to be friends with him, but we simply had dry conversations, besides when I told him a guy had violated me. Now this has all culminated to the present day. I hit him up last night. We had such different energy this time around.
We discussed the past, and I apologized for every time I spazzed out. He didn’t deserve it. Every time he stopped talking was because he was overwhelmed, depressed, working, or I cussed him out. He picked me up, hugged and kissed me, and opened my door. Then we drove off. We caught each other up about what’s been happening since we last spoke; I listened to his stories in Korea; I told him how I went to the club with a girl who ended up trying to fight me and how I’m taking summer classes. We laughed and overall had a great time. This was the first time we hung out without having sex. I asked him straight up if he wanted to go with the flow. He said yes, and we agreed to take baby steps. He dropped me off, kissed me a bunch while hugging me, and drove off. Should I take this chance? I saw our growth, but I don’t want the same story ending. I’m 4 months celibate, and been really focusing on myself. I’m open to having him in my life again cause we can go to the gym together, get money together, and see if we can build something. At the same time he has a avoidant attachment style while I have anxious attachment style. I wanted to add his child lives in a different state with her mother and her boyfriend. He and her were in a bitter custody battle, and he did lose. He was homelessness a couple of weeks, and has only semi-recently stabilized himself. He tries to see his baby as much as possible, but because he can literally be deployed at random it’s hard to coordinate anything in person, so he FaceTimes and calls her.",throwawaybby02120825,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e51u8/trying_to_see_where_things_go_again_for_the_4th/,1690774550.0,1.0

I have know this guy for like a week and a half now… and everything seemed okay he seems like a really nice guy. So we go on a third date and we get pizza and before this I get weed from the dispensary! So we smoked before we got pizza and we where having a nice walk in the park. Went on a little trail and had a long talk on a bench he seemed completely normal. We get pizza and he drinks one beer. Then we didn’t want the night to end so we decided to go to another park it has a bigger trail. We smoke again and talk then he mentioned to me that he was feeling really high. So we sit down on a bench and he say he’s about ready to leave after 5 minutes. So I agree and we start walking back to the car… then out of nowhere this man falls head first on the side of the grass from the walk way. I immediately run over to help him… he was out for a good 1 minute.. I ask him what’s wrong I get know response. I then go to try to pick him up because I realized he is fainted and then he ended up falling again onto the concrete. People are coming over asking me what had happened or if he needs help. And I don’t know what to do.. and this man pees his pants right in front of everyone on the ground.. I’m in shock at this point and within about another minute he got back up and started walking to his car. I tell him to slow down and I tell him to hold onto me and put his hand around me as he’s walking, so he doesn’t fall and hit his head again because he’s barely walking. then he starts walking decent for like the next 30 seconds then he drops to the ground and by this time another woman had come up and asked us what is going on and I’m clueless at this point and in shock and he’s sweating profusely, and he asks her for her water. she gives it to him and he’s kind of just speaking gibberish and she says I need to call 911 but he keeps saying I’m fine I’m fine then he goes and gets up again and then starts walking towards his car so I open the door for him and help him in and he turns on the AC in his car to cool down, but I am extremely concerned and I’ve never seen anything like this before.

"Should I tell my new GF that one of my friends is my ex? I dated a girl when we were pretty young  13-14 for about a year. In it the relationship was a lot things, very few of them good. But in the end it ended in a rather amicable fashion.

We cut ties for a while, probably 2 years or so maybe less before we ended up speaking again over Discord.

That was back in 2020 and now in 2023 we're rather close friends, I ended up joining her friend group who, for the most part are unaware we dated. She found a boyfriend for herself dometime during our cut connectio  who I'm also friends with (and is aware of our past) through the group. And honestly calling it ""her"" friend group feels weird I'm just a member of the group now they're my friend group too. At the news I had found someone she was really excited to meet them because, well I'm advancing in my life and that's something we both celebrate for one another.

Anyway all this to say we're pretty close. But there's absolutely 0 spark remaining between our different partners. We both want whats best for eachother, support eachothers goals and dreams, share memes and laughs and jokes and reminicse about our childhood, entirely ignoring the fact we dated throughout it. It is merely a mutual, close, friendship.

Which is where my new girlfriend comes in. In a friendship where our past is still obscure to a lot of our friends because its ancient, dead and buried history, is it worth all the drama to even call her my ex over, childhood friend when introducing her? 

I want what's best for my new gfs emotional wellbeing and this is, unfortunately something I'm not always good at reading. The idea of betrayal if someone offhandedly mentioned we dated does make me worry about lying, especially because its not exactly a white lie, but I hear its a big red flag to be friends with your ex but I'm kinda in too deep to stop it now. Not without causing a big rift across my friends. Plus I don't want to stop being friends!

"[30M] When life is a hall of mirrors... The last few years have been difficult for me as my disease has progressed to the beginning of the end stage. It's come with a long list of realizations, compromises, and acceptances. I've always had to overcome adversity my whole life, but I always could adapt, rebound, and succeed. This time the damage and loss is permanent, there's no going back, and going forward means losing the rest of what's left of myself and who I am piece by piece, day by day, and I've already lost too much. It's warped and destroyed my life and completely turned my world inside-out. What's more, it has overtly changed the way people react to and treat me. Especially when it comes to making friends, and double especially dating. And by that I mean they just avoid me, altogether. It's made this period of my life extremely difficult and solitary.

I've spent the last several years completely alone. No friends, no romance, minimal interaction with the outside world. Not by choice, and not for lack of trying. And the truth is it's killing me faster, especially when people lead me on instead of just having the guts to say ""no"". Which would hurt a hell of a lot less than blown expectations. But when you're looking down the barrel of life, with Death patiently waiting for you in the cylinder, it really makes you realize what's important. I have so much left I need to do, and I don't want to finish this life alone.

I don't want sympathy. I just want someone to treat me like a normal person again. I want the same chances you'd give anyone else. I want to be looked at like a human being when I'm in public instead of with sympathy or repulsion. I'm a person, too, regardless of any medical issues I may have. I know I deserve the same shots at friendship and/or love as everyone else and, though I don't say it, it literally sickens me that I have to practically beg people just to interact with me for 30 damn seconds. I can't imagine what it'd take me to get a phone number.

Blemishes aside, I am an amazing and loving person who has lived a beautiful and full yet tragic almost 31 years. There is so much more to me than the conclusions people draw with one glance. It breaks my heart that people can't see past the tragedy and take a chance on me for everything else I am inside rather than everything I am at face value.

Hopefully there's still someone out there that can see past the rust and grime, with the patience to get to know me for the person I am. If that's you then send me a message. I would genuinely love to talk to you, especially if you're in the PHX area. 

Thanks for the read. Best wishes.",domiluci,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ds963/30m_when_life_is_a_hall_of_mirrors/,1690740826.0,0.84

"My fifth date——about my dating experience on a herpes dating site Navigating the dating scene as someone living with herpes can be complex, but a herpes dating site has made things considerably simpler. This is the account of my fifth encounter on this platform, a one-night stand with a woman, shared in a mild and straightforward manner.

This woman, let’s call her Jane for the ease of this narrative, had an online presence that resonated with me. Harboring a common ground owing to our shared experiences, we started conversing and developed a reasonable rapport. Eventually, we agreed on meeting in person at a nearby bakery.

Our real-life interaction was no different from our online conversations: comfortable and engaging. Jane was equally charismatic in person, and our conversations flowed naturally. We spent the day discussing our interests, sharing anecdotes, and gradually feeling more comfortable with each other.

As it grew late, Jane invited me over to her place. Maintaining mutual respect and understanding for our situation, we mutually decided to extend the boundaries of our relationship. We both knew the precautions and boundaries required due to our condition. Consent was a crucial part of our interaction, and we did not disregard it at any point.

Our one-night stand was gentle and respectful, nothing more than an extension of our connection. We both respected each other’s spaces and understood our circumstances, making our intimate interaction less daunting and more approachable.

With the break of dawn, we parted our ways, cherishing the pleasant memories of connection and understanding we had made.",N111ko_for_dating,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e2q1d/my_fifth_dateabout_my_dating_experience_on_a/,1690767469.0,0.5
"I was asked for my number tonight which I declined. The guy seemingly very nice and successful was considerably older than me (I’m thinking in his 60s) I’m in my mid 40s. We were talking post my gig I was just being chatty and erudite, he said I find you intriguing and captivating can I be cheeky and get your number?

Now here’s the issue I am single and I am looking for someone and I’m conscious that historically my taste in men hasn’t been terribly good. And I have no doubt that this man would have made for a very nice and interesting date. But he looked old! He look like someone, I would’ve tried to set my mum up with not me! So I lied, and I said I had recently started seeing someone, politely declined and walked away.

However, I am very conscious that opportunities to meet people are few and far between. Did I do the right thing? Did I rob myself of a nice evening with an interesting person? I really do not want to settle ever again. And currently a chap. I am interested in is giving me mixed signals. I have promised myself this week. I’m going to ask him out for a drink/friendly date.

"How should I approach this situation? So one of my batchmates from college just moved in near my house and we matched on Bumble. We never really talked while in college but I did have a crunsh on her at the time. But right now she didn't make the move in 24hrs and the match expired. Talk about timing being everything.

But as we were in the same college her profile on instagram was easy to find. Should i make the first move instead ?

Adding to the intrigue, there's a lurking suspicion about her profile's authenticity. Catfish tales are all too common in the online dating scene. I was thinking maybe I could use something I saw in this video , you know send her a DM saying ""we should take it of Bumble.""

I am afraid of the possible gossips in the back If I make a move considering we have a lot of common acquaintances ,but strangely, no common friend to pave the wayWhat if she's just as hesitant as I am?

But amidst all the excitement, there's a tiny catch - I'm not exactly a master conversationalist. It's nerve-wracking to think that after all this buildup, I might fumble on the conversation itself. But if I'm taking the plunge, I need a brilliant icebreaker to set the stage for a chat.

"Used to hook up with her friend now shes asked me on a date So I (m30) hooked up with a girl , F, a few times in the last year (f26)

Her best friend, lets call her P- would also talk to me with her in clubs and bars and asked me once why I didnt ask F out on a proper date. I had a feeling that we don't have the same long term goals or plans but kinda got pressured into asking her out ( I did/do like her). The date went well but it confirmed my fears.

Since the date, F and I still flirt regularly but nothing has happened. She has drunk text me a bit.

Last week she drunk sent me a selfie with her best friend P and I said you guys look hot

P messaged the next day and we started chatting. It was harmless to me because I thought she had a boyfriend and I'm literally flirting with her best friend. However the messages got really flirty and she eventually said when are you taking me out on a date? 

I even said something like I guess we will have to keep this quiet and she said why? 

I dont really see much happening with F and want to kinda see P but feel awful and also dont want to hurt F.

Do I just play along for now? do I speak to P and ask if shes told F or do I just pull out altogether?

"I’m a 32 year old woman and I’ve never had a boyfriend. I want a baby but I’m afraid I’ll never have one. 
I haven’t been successful with dating. I’m unattractive but I try to fix my appearance. I haven’t gone past the first date. I’m used to rejection at this point. Never had a kiss, never had sex, I haven’t even hugged a guy. 

I want to be a mother so bad. I can’t afford IVF or any of those fancy treatments. I need to find a man to have a baby with me. The last date I went on was a month ago and it didn’t go well. I’ve been looking for resources for women in my position. It seems the best I can do now is find a guy who wants to be a dad and have a baby with him. I could just go find a guy and get pregnant and raise the baby alone. I really want my baby to have a dad though.

I have baby stuff already. I’ve been getting stuff for the past decade. I have stuffed animals and a few sets of clothes and blankets. I thought I’d be a mother by now. No one was come around that wants it. I see couples with babies and I get so upset. Why can’t I have that? I have no other purpose in life. I want my own family. 

I’m so frustrated. I never imagined my life would be like this. I thought I’d be married. I’ve been asking guys out for fifteen years. Nothing good has happened. I don’t even try to get guys that are way too hot for me. I ask out normal guys.

"8 Red Flags to notice and consider when dating someone seriously. This is based on a recent experience I had (31 y old male) while dating an older woman. These are 8 things to watch out for because they could prevent long term longevity.

1) Controlling 

Seeks to rule with a presiding authority over how your time is spent, and who you are allowed to associate with. Devalues your social circle in attempt to create codependency based isolation. Wants to shape your life into a submissive role that supports their own world, and their own goals while marginalizing your personal ones. Wants your behavior to be reflective of what they say is or isn’t acceptable, any violation of which could result in consequential punishment. 


2) Manipulative 

Utilizes coercive tactics to enforce their desired end results, including punishment/reward mechanisms. Instead of compassion and respect being given freely out of love, any attention or admiration must strictly be earned through adherence to the rules they set. Time of your own is largely nonexistent. You have to always be available when they need you for something or when they feel ‘lonely’.


3) Overly Critical and judgmental 

The past is never the past, and instead of seeing the best in your potential, they will frequently bring up your previous mistakes to devalue you, criticize you, or make you have feelings of shame and regret. You apologize more than once for problems that you are wanting to move on from. They can’t let go of their resentment towards you. You may even be extremely accepting of things they did wrong while they are the complete opposite towards you.


4) Avoids admitting fault or accepting blame 

They avoid accountability 90% of the time. Sometimes they deflect from their actions by blaming you. Also known as blame shifting. You stop bringing up things you disagree with because you know it will likely never be resolved. You are never allowed to win an argument and they rarely if ever apologize for any of their own behaviors.


5) Lack of empathy 

When you are experiencing a difficult time in your life, they have no empathy for you. They accuse you of playing the victim. Instead of expressing care and concern, they tell you that you are weak or they make comments to disregard your thoughts and feelings. They don’t want to understand what you’re going through. You’re supposed to be happy and joyful in all circumstances. Their version of “cheering you up” is typically unsupportive and mediocre.


6) Lack of intimacy 

They don’t show you affection often, and will stop you from initiating most physical interactions. You have to earn their affection and only on days when they aren’t too tired will they kiss you, or touch you. Leaving you feeling undesirable, or that this person doesn’t actually like you as a person. If there is an imbalance in this dynamic, it will lead to other problems in the relationship.


7) Temperamental 

Easily loses their temper at the slightest turn of events. Reactive to outside pressure with intensity that may result in being yelled at, or punished and berated. If they don’t get their way, someone has got to pay. Vengeful and cunning. 

8) Lazy, unmotivated 

They only have the energy to perform tasks that serve them and very little if any time to entertain your own ideas of a good time or how a day should be spent. They prefer to be lazy when it comes to things that you want to do. Your schedule revolves around their plans. You get used to not having any free time.


If you have any additional ones, let me know below. If you’re successfully or not in a relationship that has any of these dynamics I’d be curious to hear about your experiences.",zwolfe13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e125k/8_red_flags_to_notice_and_consider_when_dating/,1690762741.0,0.5

"Situationship or Healthy Development ? There's this weird space I haven't seen many talk about. 

When youve been love bombed by every man in your life because you've picked unhealthy partners- healthy, slow relationship development feels unsure and makes me anxious.

I've been seeing a man for about 2 months. We typically meet up once a week. We are having incredible sex at this point and exclusive without a title.

We both discussed upfront that we are slow to attach and had limited free time but he said he would put in the effort to see where this goes and I agreed to the same. 

The problem is that when we are together- typically on his days off we have an incredible time. It really feels great. I've noticed things slowly developing into something more. But, the in between we barely talk. If I text him he does NOW respond quickly (he didn't a few weeks ago) and  our conversations have sustenance. He works nights and so usually when he's awake, I'm asleep and that also complicates things. He said I can text him whenever I want but that he doesn't like the dynamics of texting and would rather get to know someone in person. He is also not active on social media. 

How do you know what is actually a situationship vs a healthy developing relationship? I understand that we complicated things with sex. I promised myself after my divorce if I felt sexually attracted to someone I would act on it. 

Unfortunately now I'm here, wondering what the heck we are. 

Any advice? Is this where I make a decision or discuss it? We HAVE discussed these things in a casual way.

"I get really nervous about sex early on and I’m not sure how to stop Most people will have sex quite early on into dating each other, but I get extremely nervous about it. Like a strange feeling in my head that I can’t shake unless I become extremely relaxed eg. If I’ve had a lot to drink. 

There’s a few worries I know I have in the back of my mind such as:

What if I get her pregnant?

We’ve been kissing for a certain amount of time, oh but I’m not turned on? I’m not good enough, so I berate myself internally which makes the situation worse

Everyone else has great sex straight away so you need to perform as well. And if you can’t then she will leave for someone who can

What if I get really attached to her by having great sex and she leaves?

What if she clearly isn’t enjoying herself? (I do like to get her off in other ways though so I do those things)

What if putting a condom on kills the mood?

I don’t feel completely comfortable and trusting in her when it comes to sex because I don’t know her well enough yet

I’ve told the current girl I’ve been dating that I need more time to get to know her so I can be more comfortable in the bedroom which she seems to be ok with.

"Online Dating as a Hyperfixation I've had many, many issues with not sounding desparate while dating online. Or at least, that's how people characterize it. And I've never understood that sentiment. Yes, I want my person. I want to stop looking. I don't *want* to project confidence at someone, I want to feel *safe* with them (I've posted about this before). I want someone to inhabit a home with me, by choice, for the rest of my life. This is my ideal state. I thought that's what most people wanted. Why be coy?

I've always characterized this need as an imperative. But this is a terrible way of explaining things, so I've been thinking of other ways to express how I feel. And last night I found the word for it: hyperfixation.

To anyone unfamiliar with the term, do you know what a mosquito bite feels like? It itches incessantly. You *need* to scratch it. And it's a little fun to do, at first, because you get that endorphin rush of quelling the itch. But then it gets bothersome. The bite gets bigger, and sore, and they often come in waves. And even when it's over, just when you're ready to do something else? You go outside, or a mosquito gets in your house, and it bites you again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have several hyperfixations, almost all of which are stupid. Some are active, while others are passive. I actively hyperfixate on things like, for example, Sonic the Hedgehog (and now you understand why I'm still a virgin). The Sonic franchise is *big*. Lots of games, cartoons, comics, etc., many of which are not in continuity with one another. And I get it in my head to gather art, or design pixel art, to visually express a headcanon. And in theory this is fine. Except that the headcanon never really works. Too many pieces don't fit together. Redundancies exist between continuities. Some characters would, hypothetically, be off-limits in a story due to copyright reasons, and for reasons I could never explain to a rational human being it impacts which characters I use. So I spend hours to days on the Sonic Wiki gathering more and more data, all of which amounts to nothing when I get swept up in my next hyperfixation. It stimulates my mind, but it also burns me out.

A passive hyperfixation often gets paired with an active hyperfixation. Like, for example, rewatching old episodes of Atop the Fourth Wall. These days I hardly pay attention to the episodes, instead letting them play as background radiation. It feels like something between white noise and having company in the room with me.

Here's where this loops back around to online dating: I love stimulating conversation. It's my favorite part of any relationship. And I think that talking, as well as *planning* a relationship, is a form of hyperfixation for me. Because my instinct is to be the architect in any courtship. I feel like I need to be, since otherwise nothing will happen. And I get attached too quickly, without understanding what I want versus what the other person wants. Because I can't understand. I could *never* understand what anyone wants. All I do is fixate on a person, create a narrative in my head, and twist myself to fit that narrative. Or I burn out, and the whole thing falls apart. Actually it falls apart either way, since the approach I take online doesn't translate well *at all* to the real world. Turns out I like to talk, and most women I talk to want to be touched and told how pretty they are all the time. Which is fine, but isn't how I operate. Because that's not how my fixation works.

I think my end-goal is also a hyperfixation. I want someone to live with me. My perfect evening is for us to sit in the living room, maybe quietly, maybe while watching TV or reading, each doing our own thing. And that sounds cold, but to me it isn't. Because we resonate with one another. We are each other's white noise. Yeah, we'd still say pretty words, kiss, have sex, whatever, but those are bonuses. The goal is to just *be* together.

So when I hear people say I come off desperate, it's because I try to solve romantic needs the same way I solve my other needs. I get in over my head, overwork myself, obsess over minor details, and it *never turns off*. Unless I burn out, or the other person gets fed up. And I keep searching for the person who I can weave into my tapestry, because it's the only way I know how to function. I can't decouple this hyperfixation from the rest.

If at least one person reads this and understands, I'll feel as if I've achieved something. ",Wooden-Trip-8053,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dotvo/online_dating_as_a_hyperfixation/,1690732177.0,0.83
"Lack of Physical Attraction Pretty much what it says on the tin. I've been hanging out with this girl for roughly a month. We started talking earlier in the summer and dropped off for a while when I was taking care of some personal stuff. We've been on about 3ish dates now. Coffee date, movie date, and a concert, granted the concert was more that one of her friends fell out and she invited me to join her and the rest of her friends. I've enjoyed each date, and I've had a great time. We both laugh and seem to enjoy ourselves throughout. I do feel like I talk a bit too much, but even when I try and get her to talk a bit more it seems very difficult to get her to actually talk about herself. I'll be honest physically she's not my typical type, but she seems like a really genuine and kind person, and I guess I'm in a position of not wanting to cut things off before they have a chance, but I also don't want to string her along.

Inconsistency with attention and the anxiety that comes with that The inconsistency with dating some people gives me so much anxiety. It’s really hard when someone is talking to you a lot and talking about how into you they are then they completely back off. This guy wanted to take me out again and I made sure to be clear and say yes I’d love to go out again and we talked throughout the week and now he hasn’t replied in two days. It’s so annoying bc it’s hard to put yourself out there and I felt I finally was doing things right. I wish people wouldn’t just say stuff for no reason and make future plans (not just about this date just in general telling me different stuff they want to do with me) ik a lot of people say it doesn’t have to do with you but I just feel like something is deeply wrong with me. I’ve had this happen before where men tell me I’m so pretty and driven and they love my personality but then stop talking to me as much.,Independent_Drink859,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dtvdq/inconsistency_with_attention_and_the_anxiety_that/,1690744880.0,1.0
"Do people tell you why they're not interested? Do you ever get feedback from people you're seeing that hasn't developed into a relationship about why they don't want more? 

Not sure what it is I should work on lol. 

Every one has seemed more concerned with making sure they're polite and friendly and that they make me feel attractive and respected, but there's never an attempt at friendship (like hanging out or texting asking about my day or major life moments). And especially never an attempt at anything more. 

I once tried being direct with someone who shifted the relationship to just friends who hang out platonically, but we basically fought because he wouldn't say anything more than I have always thought of us as friends. But like I wanted to know what does that mean to him - do I invite him to parties, will he ignore me once his new girl finds out, will I be invited to the wedding lol

"Confused with my relationship with my friend?? So when I was 21 (F)  I had a massive crush on my guy friend and I asked him out. He rejected me saying that he was in university and wanted to focus on his studies.

I didn't take that personal and we stayed friends but I kept my distance, as I still had feelings for him. 

Fast forward to 5 years which is now. He finished university and immediately asked if we can have coffee to catch up as I hadn't seen him for a long time. During the coffee catch up,  the impression I got was that he was flirting with me, he was acting all nervous and blushing hard.

The problem is , I no longer find him sexually attractive like he isn't my type anymore.  Yes I had a crush 5 years ago but I guess I got used to seeing him as a ""friend"" . He is really sweet , and I'm not sure if im being unreasonable especially because my parents really like him too. 

Is my lack of attraction to him because he friendzoned me 5 years ago? Or is it something else?

"Guy and i are way too attached Tldr: Here's my dilemma. Guy and I are very close friends. We treat each other as confidantes and he said he trust me more than 100%. We live in different cities but the thing is I often go to his city because of a problem that I have..which lately is getting better because over time I'm healing although not totally healed.

Everytime I go to his city and is about to leave, he keeps asking when I'll come back or I'll be leaving for good and then proceeds to question his life and where he will retire. Once I said I'll be traveling to another country and he's like are you leaving me. 

When i left and told him i was in the airport, he got very emotional and told me he will miss me and he's praying for my safety. 

Then, finally he visited my city due to a common friend's event. He then asked me what my plans are and where would I really be whether I'll be in his city or in my city for good and he said I'm considering living in your city and I don't want that we might go in opposite directions. 

On top of this, we are extremely emotionally attached so my issue here is I'm not entirely sure of going to his city but he asked me again when I'll come back to his city, I did say I have plans of going few weeks from now. He proceeded to plan going somewhere with me. When we are apart, we totally miss the company. When we're together, we're the happiest.

It's just that it feels like we are so committed haha but I'm a bit pressured whether this is really going to be my plan because traveling is putting a dent to my finances. He also told me though that he is dating people. I'm not hurt but I just feel that there are strong emotions involved here both in my part and on his part and we don't act like these with people we are friends with.

So I'm totally stressed out with the level of committment this entails (having to see each other seems to be a need. He also told me he needs me because with me his guards are down)

"I'm taking my best friend of 10 years on a date this Friday. How can I escalate/impress her beyond what she already knows about me? We met at the start of high school and have always been close. I've had feelings for her off and on over the years and I know that she has as well. Probably less than me, but I'm also my own worst critic. Lately we've been talking much more than usual and it's been about things like what we want in life, what we find attractive in a partner, our goals for work/family/where we want to live, etc. I've always known we're similar (duh, that's why we're friends), but it's been eye-opening to have some of those more vulnerable conversations and realize how aligned we really are.  
  
For context, this is a distance situation. I see her several times per year since we have the same home-town. We could pretty easily increase that number, but we're about 5 hours away from each other. We'll both be home to see mutual friends next weekend and I'm taking her on a date. We've been out one-on-one many times before, but this is the first time it's been super intentionally called a date. We're going to a cinema club (mutual hobby) to see something lighthearted and will probably grab drinks afterward.  
  
I'm not nervous about what we'll talk about or if we'll have a good time; I know all of that will work out. What scares me is escalating beyond our friendship. I know I should tell her she looks beautiful, break the touch barrier, find a moment for a kiss, etc. I want those things too - she is beautiful and I'm excited for the chance to be intimate. I can't help but feel like I'm playing with fire though.  
  
Any advice on making those jumps from friends to more? Ladies who have dated or otherwise been intimate with someone they knew for many years prior, what did they start to do differently that changed your perspective on the relationship?

"So how much of a dealbreaker are older self harm scars from the past? So I have some scars that are pretty obvious on clothed parts of my body. My upper arm near my shoulder and on both thighs. So you can't see them normally, but someone I'd be intimate with would definitely notice them.

They're from 2021, during a period of extreme depression stemming from childhood trauma. But in the 2 years since, that has improved dramatically. Now I pass as a normal, well-adjusted person with some quirks. You wouldn't think I'd be at a point that low in my past. I still have minor depression, with the rare major depressive episode. But those are continually improving.

However, I feel like anyone who sees my scars will immediately be repulsed, and won't give me the benefit of the doubt that I'm better, and have greatly improved. They'll see it as a sign of a major personality flaw or psychiatric disorder that will always be with me.

However, I have been in therapy for about 8 years and I have changed so much. I am very happy with where I am now, but when it comes to dating a lot of my insecurities which i have worked hard on still kind of creep back in. 

I just met a guy during a holiday which i felt a connection with and he asked me out after. I mean I want to trust my gut that he likes me because he gives of those vibes. But in the past a lot of times I thought guys liked me and eventually just dropped me (hence the situationship). This makes me even more careful then before and i am sooo scared to like someone and get hurt again. But at the same time I just want to be able to open up my heart and let someone in. 

I started freaking out again, thinking I might have read his signals wrong and he doesn't see me that way at all. While when I am with him I feel like he likes me. But now being home and having time to think, I am freaking out again... I just wish I could just stay calm and see what happens. But part of me doesn't even want to try again and get heartbroken all over... 

I do think we have a good vibe, but now that we might become something more than just friends. It feels like I don't know how to act anymore. I feel like I have a hard time being myself and I am stressing out about doing something wrong... 

How do you just stay yourself and not let your head get in the way. I just want to experience whatever this is. Not overthink it to the point that I am so filled with fear that I freeze up or freak out. I talk to my therapist, I do mindfulness, I try to calm myself down in all the ways I have used over the past. But my mind still keeps racing too much in my opinion. It sucks!

I just want to relax and see what happens, but my mind won't let me....",DowntownReading9371,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dw8zm/i_always_start_to_panic_when_things_are_starting/,1690750600.0,0.99
"Am I too much of a red flag now? I've (M49) never had much luck with women. As a teenager and in my twenties, I was overweight, shy and distinctly average-looking amongst my peers and I kind of had the confidence to date sapped from me.
 In my thirties, I lost a little weight, socialized more (went to Uni) gained a sense of confidence but again, outside of a few drunken hook-ups, I was again that guy that seemingly wasn't anyone's particular cup of tea.
In my forties, my career has progressed well, I've got a good group of friends and enjoy life. I made a concerted effort to date in my early forties through various OLD platforms but nothing happened. During this, admittedly, I wasn't in the best shape but my now ageing average looks and my inability to make a connection and dating inexperience, was again hamstringing me.
Now I'm approaching my 50th next year and although I'm pretty much at peace with probably never having a family, it would be still nice to find someone to share my life with. I'm doubling down my efforts to improve my weight and fitness, but I feel my non-existent relationship past has made me a walking red flag with women. It would be interesting to hear from women around my age (and anyone else) whether my fears are well-founded and I should quit while I'm ahead or whether there's any hope for me. TIA

"39M Dating Profile Advice I am a 39-year old man looking to potentially start dating after my partner died 11 years ago. I am a tall (6'3""), fat (currently 300 lbs; am down 30 lbs and continuing to lose), bipolar (medicated), introverted, highly functioning autistic single father of a 16-year old trans girl. That is an enormous amount of baggage packed into one sentence, but I am also highly educated (masters degree), generally successful (6-figure salary, own my own home), and have been told I am friendly and caring, though I tend to overthink things.

With all of that being said, since I had met my partner at work many years ago by happenstance, I don't exactly know how to go about it. I figure Online Dating is a good place to start, which brings me to my real question:

If I am interested in dating, open to serious or casual relationships depending on the connection, how much baggage should I put in a profile? Height and weight are kind of no-brainers, as is my child (she is my first priority, but at 16 she doesn't really need a new mom) of course, but I am kind of torn on the rest. My bipolar disorder is under control with medication and I am very open when talking to people to let them know (when it might matter, coworkers, bosses, etc.) but there is the very real stigma surrounding it, and I don't want to blindside anyone. My autism could probably go without mentioning since I learned about it recently, but now that I know I also feel it would be wrong to not tell someone that might be interested in getting serious with me (maybe this would be a thing to leave out of a profile but bring up after a few dates?).

I guess I am looking for advice on balancing sufficient, honest disclosure vs. oversharing. ",Particular-Crab335,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dvvg1/39m_dating_profile_advice/,1690749706.0,1.0

"Having trouble maintaining my relationship Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year now. We loved each other but recently we’re having some problems at a tiring rate.

Things started to get difficult after I moved back with my mom after an unexpected chance of living together with my girlfriend for about 2 months, and my girl friend didn’t cope with my absence very well. She told me that she felt very down and cried a lot because she missed me. I comforted her that I missed her too and now it’s just a phase before we can officially live together.
After the first week she came up with the idea of getting a dog, I think that getting a dog might make her feel less lonely so I agree with her and we did went to get the dog together.

The first week after getting the dog, things does not seem to turn out well. She told me that this is a mistake and she couldn’t take care of the dog like she thought she can. I said to her that it’s normal for people to have cold feet after taking in a pet and I myself did feel the same way when I got my dog. And that she should take a try for the first month and if things does not get better we will find another foster home for the dog. Another week went by and everything seem to be brighter. She started getting used to taking care of the dog and she does not feel too down like when I moved out.

But then, the dog had scab. The scab has been before we took her in. My girl friend had spent a lot of money treating the dog condition. Now to think I was so stupid not telling her to contact the people that sold the dog to us, because we did contact them and they said they will cover the expense for us but we’ve already paid for another facility. Currently the treatment does seem to work but too slow. Back when things got better, we had plan on taking some time for ourselves, but with the treatment got longer than expected, i’ve told her she and I should wait in case of the larger expense. We had a fight, she said to me that she felt helpless that she cannot afford to do anything on her own without thinking to much like before she got the dog. I said that it’s normal that it does take a lot of money when someone first take care of a pet, not too mention that it is sick. She replied that she did understand but she just couldn’t wrap her head around the fact that now she cannot treat herself like before. Eventually she partly accepted the situation.

For my part, now with this continuous chain of poor choice, unlucky events and my many attempts to cheer her up just for things to drag her down even further depressed, I honestly don’t know what to do next because it broke my heart to see her like this and I don’t seem to help her feel better at all. And it also affected my life as I’m writing this at 3 in the morning because I can’t stop thinking about my relationship. I would be really appreciated if you guys could help me with some advice. Thank you, in advance.

"Is it a good idea to break No Contact? (F20 &amp; M21) I want him back. We were a great couple, the reason we broke up was because of distance. (We were long distance, he broke up with me)
 He even admitted that he believes “in true love” that “if one day, weeks, months or years later we meet again at a better time” then we could try again. 

We didn’t talk for a week, until I texted him about a serious situation (I found out I was pregnant after the break up, and lost the baby the following week). The situation was the only reason we were in contact for two weeks, he was very supportive and inclusive despite not wanting the baby because of our financial standings and that fact that we weren’t together anymore. (I’m better now emotionally and physically) but during that time of communication my ex admitted that he started vaping weed carts again since he broke things off with me.

As his ex gf there’s really nothing i can do, I can’t force him to stop, as a friend, however, I only suggested that he should stop soon unless he wants to risk everything in his life like job and family relationships.

We both made a promise, he stops smoking, and I start taking care of myself emotionally.

We haven’t talked for a week and I’ve been avoiding his stories, posting anything, I deleted most of my social media too. NO CONTACT basically.

And he texted today saying 
“I haven't smoked since we last talked, I hope you kept your promise. I hope you're doing better bye”

I all I wanna tell him is that I’m proud of him and that I’m doing much better too, but I also don’t want to answer him because of no contact…(we still have our “love” background from insta)

"I accidentally turned someone off We were doing okay. We dated 4 times in a span of 3 months because I was 4 hours away from her. I think I blew it. We were always chatting and laughing in chat. We were okay as well when in person. At least for me I don't know about her.

Anyways long story short. I think I blew it. I am not sure if I said something or did something. But I have my theories. Maybe I should not have found an excuse to touch her hand. Maybe I should not have said things like how are we or does she see any red flags or overexplained things.

There was this one time where she said she wanted to skip dinner. I said it's alright but on the 3rd time she said sorry I said ""promise it's okay. Who am I to complain (laughing emoji).

All these bad things happened in 1 day. Maybe she got turned off by taking candid picture of her or I wasn't confident in my answers or she didn't like how I think. Or maybe it was my outfit she didn't like. All I know is all this thing I am saying happened in the last date. I should have been more mindful.

She said our personalities just didn't jive and no connection after was starting to ignore my good mornings and seem to not be interested in chatting anymore.

"The end of virtual love: online dating for half a year, but a liar Half a year ago, a boy named Jack added me as a fri

&amp;#x200B;

end on a social platform. We started chatting, and it all seemed wonderful. We have a lot in common and often talk for hours. Gradually, we care about each other and support each other. Jack is a person full of sunshine and positive energy, and I gradually began to rely on his existence.  
  
Over time, Jack told me he lived in a small town not too far from me. We decided to meet, and I went to the meeting place full of anticipation. However, when I arrived at my destination, I found that the world was not as beautiful as I expected.  
  
The boy Jack originally described was completely different, replaced by a ramshackle cabin. I started to feel flustered, but I went in resolutely. I found the room disorganized, with wine bottles everywhere and broken furniture. A dirty man appeared in front of me, he was not the gentle and caring Jack I expected.  
  
He smiled and said in broken language, ""Are you here to drive me away?"" I was uneasy, but still trying to understand the story in front of this man.  
  
He begins to tell about his past, a time when he was a wealthy businessman whose fortune gradually disappeared due to a series of unfortunate events. To a certain extent, he pinned his hopes on online fraud and was forced by life, but he also regretted what he had done. I immediately understood that this man was the Jack I knew. Although he was far from the image I expected, I still felt pity for him in my heart.  
  
Jack and I had a long chat that rainy afternoon. He honestly apologized to me, admitting that his false actions were motivated by feelings of desperation and deprivation. I can feel the deep remorse and self-blame in his heart.  
  
Even though Jack was more broken than he was before, I knew we had formed a special bond. I decided to forgive him and reach out to him when he needed help. I want him to find himself again, to rerealize his lost value from within.  
  
I worked with Jack through a long rebuilding phase, as he underwent career training, sought counseling, and worked to move beyond his past. We develop a whole new level of trust and understanding, sometimes even deeper than before.  
  
Virtual worlds are not always real, but real emotion can be found in these illusions too. Sometimes, people act falsely not only out of selfishness, but also out of inner emptiness and desperation. We should learn to be tolerant and understanding, so as to support others sincerely.  
  
It is not impossible for virtual love to become real, it just needs more tests and persistence. Of course, it does happen that you only meet after chatting online for half a year and find out that the other party is a liar, so it is also very important to be vigilant in online dating.

do we still need to go on？？？？？？？

"We just had our 3rd date and I still feel confused as to whether she even likes me-- what do I do? I (F25) have been dating a woman (F25) for 3 weeks. We've been out with each other once each week. Our actual dates are pretty fun and I like her. The problem is that I'm not sure if she feels the same way at all. 

The main reasons are as follows: 

1. Her texting response times are glacial. Always within the day, but many hours later. If it were up to me, we'd be chatting a lot more, and that's even with the fact that I normally hate texting. I want to talk to her, and get to know her. Part of me wonders: am I just getting too attached too quickly, maybe these response times are normal? 

2.  I've been driving everything. I've planned and paid for all of our dates, which I'm delighted to do-- but combined with the first point, it overall feels like she wouldn't even notice if I just dropped off the face of the planet. She showed a bit of initiative by asking if I wanted to go to a museum with her this weekend, but she had a change of plans and we didn't go. 

3. She's been a bit more physically distant than I would like-- like we haven't even kissed yet and I haven't bothered asking because I feel like she wouldn't be comfortable with it. I feel like you should only ask to kiss if you're really feeling that mutual ""energy"" in the air-- but I'm just not getting that from her. She said she wants to go slow, and I totally understand and even prefer it. ""Going slow"" is a green flag to me. But in light of the above two points, it just feels like I'm getting strung along a bit. To be clear, I would never pressure her or even ask her to do anything physical. I'm waiting on her and I'd be happy to wait as long as she likes. I'm just listing this as a point because I feel that I'm overall getting no positive indication from her that she's into me. 

It just confuses me that she still seems to enjoy our dates (and agrees to more), even though she seems to show minimal interest in me outside of them. It's made me dislike her, honestly. So as a result, I've come to the conclusion that I should cease planning any further dates and stop trying to text her. (Although, being the drunk idiot that I was on our last date on Friday, I invited her to take my second ticket to an expensive upcoming concert 🤦). My thinking is that if she basically doesn't take any initiative whatsoever within the next week, I'll take that as a rejection and move on. She could:

1. Initiate a text conversation with me.

2. Ask me out on a date.

3. y'know 👉👈 

And if she does any of the above, it might not really mean that it'll work out, but I'll at least not call it quits completely by next Sunday. But I don't know if this is the right course of action or what.

"[Loneliness] Being unmarried or single for whole life Hey Folks, I will be turning 30 next year. Currently single and not planning to fall in love / get married. 

I have been into 3 long relationships - spanning more than 3 years each of them. 

For most of the life aspects it is normal, I don't feel any issue being single. I have a pretty busy schedule - job, workout, sleep, hobbies once in a while. I don't find issue in making myself busy. I enjoy myself.

The only thing that causes an itch in my heart is the feeling of loneliness. I feel there are lots of things you can not share with friends or close family members. There is a sense of completeness you get from another human only, someone you know who is always there, someone you can call and chat for any long, someone who you can spend as much time as possible.

"is it okay if i unblock a few ppl after breakup? okay so basically  me and my ex broke up like 2-3 weeks ago (he blocked me coz i refused to give my n00ds, thats how i got to understand) so it is a pretty complicated thing to explain honestly but yeah basically before he had my insta pass (i changed it) and while we were together one morning I didn't notice earlier but i went to my blocked list and saw so many ppl there (including some friends i was pretty close with) and also left the groupchat (from my behalf). i get him, maybe he felt those as my ex (the one before him) was there in the gc but he was blocked before the day me and him started talking. but how could i leave so many good connections and friends coz of that one filthy human? idk why i felt kinda violated? i mean yes if he had problems with either, he could've just told me and i would block them idc but he didn't unless i confronted and we had an argument (which i didnt really want) and he went all ""i guess i'll never do it again"" vibe. i said okay good i don't like certain ppl he talks to as well so i asked him to block them and he went so defensive lol either way ik i had some faults in that relationship but now i feel like at least if not talk again, maybe i could unblock them? is it too problematic?",rogueburger_35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dry8u/is_it_okay_if_i_unblock_a_few_ppl_after_breakup/,1690740069.0,0.33

"How do you know if someone is dating you for superficial reasons I broke up with my boyfriend because of some red flags at the time . I misinterpreted some things that he said , actually I don’t really know now and am having second thoughts. He seems to say things sometimes without thinking first . In my experience people usually tell you who they are if you listen enough however . One time he said “maybe women shouldn’t work because of their periods” and another time he said that “some people think that women shouldn’t have been allowed to vote”. After talking to him about these things that he said and how they came off as extreme and misogynistic statements in 2023, he explained that he thinks that we still aren’t able to talk about how periods affect women and that women should be able to take time off work if their periods really affect them enough. He also clarified and said that there are some people who think that women should not have been given the right to vote because women are considered underprivileged still in our society they can be easily manipulated by political candidates even if the candidate isn’t a good candidate and isn’t going to help our country in general they will say they will help women’s rights and women will buy into it. He said that isn’t his belief that women shouldn’t have been given the right but that he understands where people who say this are coming from and doesn’t know what the answer is for women or minorities who are easily manipulated by these political candidates. So all of that makes sense and is a discussion that makes sense but the original statement he makes comes off as extreme right? 

I have given this guy the benefit of the doubt because I think we all can say extreme things and not exactly mean it. He told me I have said extreme things about men too or other topics and he doesn’t hold it against me. He cited that I at one point made a statement and said that I had said that a lot of men are sexual perforators . I think we were watching chris Hanson lol. I responded that might come off as extreme and can see how people would be put off by my statement but that statistics show that a lot of sexual assaults are under reported and even the statistics that are reported are high with 1 in 4 women being sexually assaulted in her life . In my own experience using dating apps and dating in general I have been sexually harassed or groped approximately 20 times in my life so I was also making this statement based on my experience. I don’t think that this statement comes off as hating all men or anything like that. I also don’t think it is comparable to his statements as I feel like in this time most men are a little more careful about saying such extreme statements since the difference is that women can fear men and men don’t experience that with women . I feel like he’s trying to flip the script to avoid accountability ?

Most recently after trying to be understanding of my boyfriends statements and getting back together he told me that he felt he needed to reach out to me again and get back together with me because I am the most beautiful woman he’s ever dated. I was really offended at this particular statement because all of my life I have experienced men lying about themselves, misrepresenting themselves , and lying about their intentions in order to date me because they think I’m attractive . I’m not saying I don’t want to be considered attractive but it is also a double edged sword in dating just like I’m sure rich guys have that double edged sword too. I said how this really offended me and my boyfriend apologized and said he says stupid things sometimes and how he obviously likes other things about me and then cited him stating these other things this way which can sound harsh . He does constantly compliment me on other things like my cooking skills, how we have amazing conversations, how he’s never met anyone like me that thinks the way I do and how we can talk about all kinds of topics , how I am really sweet, how I am health focused, and how smart I am . 

But this statement bothered me I guess because of my experiences of men lying and even making me think they really like me only to find out they like me primarily because they find me attractive and that is their main priority . I have so much more to offer than how I look and want someone who can appreciate those other things as much because someday I’m going to get old and wrinkly just like all of us , and there’s got to be more to a relationship than that . I would like to see it as a compliment I took the wrong way but idk. How do I know if my boyfriend just says dumb stupid shit sometimes ? How do I know that he really likes me for me primarily and not shallow stuff ? How do I know if he is trying to backtrack and cover up statements  he makes ?",Odd_Match2206,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15drq5a/how_do_you_know_if_someone_is_dating_you_for/,1690739498.0,1.0

However I am more than meets the eye, I feel like I am overlooked but I'm willing to put tons of effort into a relationship and show good love. But why is it that women automatically think a tall guy is immediately attractive? Most tall men aren't that good looking and model like. 

Some also have personalities that aren't all the attractive either. 15% of men are tall. Tall men can also be gay too so that cuts the percentage down even further. There is unattractive tall men too either by personality, looks or both which could cut it down even further. What is rather sad is that sometimes or even most of the time tall men only get seen as attractive for their height and none of their other traits are considered.",Silly_General7059,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dwkji/why_do_women_assume_tall_guys_are_immediately/,1690751349.0,0.25
"NBSB at 22 Hello everyone, I am F(22) about to graduate from Uni and start living my life as an adult soon. I won't say it's embarrassing but I don't have any experience in dating and never had been intimate with a guy because I focused solely on school. I didn't fancy putting a lot of effort to what I look like before and just lived off life as a student who works hard. However, these past three years I started paying attention to what I look like and invested greatly on myself. I'd say I love how it made me feel really because I think it made me confident and happy looking at myself in the mirror. It also made me feminine, which is another delight all in itself. I discovered I like being girly girly... wearing dresses, necklaces, and fancying make up too. I started getting a lot of compliments and admirers out of nowhere. I've never received them before in all honesty and it makes me warm hearing them. I'm not exactly lonely because I think I'm pretty established emotionally (being single all these years) but I wanted to enter the dating scene and try being with other people's company aside from myself now that I'm pretty fine with who I am. Now, I'm kind of traditional and don't want hook ups or any of the sort. I just want someone who's up for the long term and who wants to build a possible future with me. So this goes that I don't want someone who'll just play around. Now the real issue arises, am I likely to be taken advantage of because of my zero experience in dating? Do guys still want someone like me who might be ignorant to the ups and downs of a relationship as given to never experiencing one?

I get a text shortly after saying that when you hang up the phone u don’t say goodbye u say ciao see you later or talk later. He was dead serious.

So now I am pretty straight forward with women and I’m not sure how it’s being received or if I am being creepy? Is it ok to just want sex? I feel kind of weird being that way.

"Am I doomed? So, probably a fairly common query on here but here goes...

Years ago when I think I was at university this girl followed me on Instagram. I didn't follow her back as didn't know her but she's always been active in viewing my stories etc, kinda odd. Out the blue after like 10 years she messaged me and we got chatting, just friendly really. She then mentioned she was moving away for work and asked if I wanted to continue or meet before she went? I politely declined and said it wasn't really what I was after... (She just wanted to have some fun I think)
She then suggests I speak to her friend who she showed my photo to and said she recognised me from a dating app years ago and that she liked how I looked. 

I got speaking to her, seems really nice but is a little guarded ( won't give out socials) due to bad post experiences so we are chatting on Skype messages lmao. 

She is legit, really pretty, smart and interesting. Kind of out of my league I feel. I think she is fairly experienced in dating so probably isn't nervous.

I on the other hand have been single most my life with only a few times really putting myself out there but only when something falls in my lap really, kinda like this situation. Without trying to be cocky, I'd say I'm decent, I'm 6'5, look ok, in ok shape, good professional job and good chat when around people I know, bit of a softie.. All my mates and their wives can't understand why I'm single and try to set me up so they think I'm a catch for their friends enough to recommend... but when it comes to dating I just get kinda nervous, as if I'm going to talk Infront a crowd of 1000 people. So I've made it all this way kinda not doing much and just avoiding feeling uncomfortable. But I'm fully aware this is holding me back in life and I want to change it.

I really like this girl but just feel that when we meet my nerves will get the better of me and it will overshadow who I am and what she's grown to like and she'll end up bolting. We are planning to meet soon.

"Should I confess to my long-distance friend of three years that I have feelings for him or just let it go? I really don't know what to do and I really need your honest advice. This is my first time writing here, never in my life I thought I would do this, but here I am. I've been reading stuff for a while and I enjoyed it. I am having second thoughts about confessing to my friend so I thought maybe I should ask for some advice. Backstory, we met online and we became good friends, you know we talked every week sometimes we call. Then I got into a relationship and surprisingly, we're still friends. My ex and I broke and it destroyed me so much and he was there. He's one of my support systems who helped me a lot during those times. I got back up again and now I'm happy with my life, still on that healing journey but I am better now. I denied to myself that I was having feelings for him for a lot of times because I thought maybe I just carried away because he's always there for me through ups and downs and maybe because he's giving me attention. As time passed by, my feelings were going deeper and now I'm sure. The thing is, he's in Europe and I am in Asia, we haven't met yet, but I know what I am feeling is real. I want to keep this friendship for this lifetime, that's how much I am grateful for our friendship. But now, I am afraid I might ruin it because of my feelings. 😔 I don't know if I should keep it to myself forever because I feel like that's me lying to myself. 

He told me about his new co-worker and he told me he finds her pretty and nice. He said he doesn't like her nor have a crush on her. He's just curious about her and wants to know more. He wants to talk with her and see where it goes. It breaks my heart but I can't say anything. So, would it be selfish of me to confess to him now? I just want to confess so I won't hurt myself anymore because of regrets. I know there will be a possibility of him dating her, so maybe before that happens I will just try to confess so that I'll have peace of mind too. But, I am scared. I want to keep this friendship forever, but I am afraid that my feelings will ruin it. 

What should I do? I am desperately asking for help now. I am sorry, I hope you guys will have a nice day and thank you too!

It has only been a few hours since I posted but I thought I’d like to clarify a few things. I was considering couples therapy a lot and I did phone one of our local councillors who has a good reputation for situations like mine but unfortunately the prices that was put in place was way too much. I haven’t been able to work due to my physical health and I’m not in the right state of mind to work. I used to love working and I reminisce on the good old days where I used to deliver milk and fresh meats in and around my local area. Thank you to the person who suggested taking my wife to the place we first met, I really think that’ll bring back the good memories and re ignite the spark we once had.

I'm beginning to understand more and more why people settle because sometimes having someone to laugh with and cuddle IS better than always holding yourself. 

Being single is a bit boring, no matter how much you focus on yourself. There are a lot of lonely nights and it's also becoming increasingly expensive in my country which is set up such that only couples in this day and age can thrive or even live comfortably. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way. Is this just human or maybe I'm not yet at the end of my self development journey and will reach a point where I don't feel this way?",AvenueLane96,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d1qsj/exhausted_of_being_single/,1690661771.0,0.94
"Why has he been having sex with me for a year, when he's not physically attracted to me? I matched with a guy on a dating app a year ago. When he saw me he said wow as if he found me attractive. And we've been having sex since August of last year sometimes he would even ask me to come over. When we first had sex he said he loved my breasts which are huge. But none of these models he follows on Facebook have breasts like mine.

Yet I see where he likes skinny models on his Facebook page. He only follows pages that feature skinny chicks. I don't see where he's following pages of women who look like me. (His ex-wife is also skinny) So it's obvious I'm not really his type physically. So why has he been having sex with me for this long?

"My ex catfished me using Hinge after I broke up with him for cheating I found out my ex (35m) had been cheating on me (27F) with multiple women (including two other somewhat serious relationships) via my local city’s Are We Dating The Same Guy Facebook group. When I initially found out, I didn’t have the whole story, so I let him convince me that he had just made a one time mistake and took him back. 

A few weeks later when I caught him lying about being with another girl, I broke up with him again. After I had blocked him on literally every platform, including the dating apps when his profile would pop up, I thought he’d finally leave me alone. 

THEN I started talking to a guy on hinge and agreed to go on a date at a newer restaurant in town for dinner. When I showed up to the date, it was not the man from hinge who my friends and I had researched and found multiple socials (Insta, Linkden, address, etc) for, but instead was my ex sitting there waiting for me in the restaurant. He’d used the hinge profile and a BURNER PHONE to trick me into seeing him face to face to “talk and try to work things out”

I posted an update of what he did in AWDTSG, and he posted in a Reddit thread to recruit people to report my Facebook profile to get it taken down so the multiple other women he was talking to wouldn’t find out. 

He ended up getting removed from the original AWDTSGIsToxic thread, but during this I started posting on my TikTok to tell the full story of what happened, and I have a hunch he’s in another thread on Reddit telling people to go report my videos.",DevSeriously,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dejni/my_ex_catfished_me_using_hinge_after_i_broke_up/,1690699285.0,0.75

"I’m assuming I should give up? Hey guys. 
Since around 6 weeks ago, me and this girl I met on tinder really hit things off. We seemed to work really well with one another, like as if we knew each other for years beforehand. Nonetheless, the past week or two have been different. She started by seeming more blunt, and defensive over things - such as when I give her advice or something which she doesn’t want. I was fine with this. But since then, she has stated she wanted to take things slow due to her past relationships being difficult and even abusive, so she needed time to prepare and get herself ready for me. This too, I was fine with.

But. That was only the beginning. Since then, she became more and more blunt, slower and worse replies etc. and the second I question it, she gets super defensive and annoyed, and thus becomes overall worse with me. So, to cut a long story short, I’m now at a point where she isn’t able to meet for a month due to how “busy” she is, and she hasn’t even replies to any of my messages today.

For context, we had met up around 6 times, and the dates were always great. She never took advantage of me, and I never did of her either. It seemed perfect.",Alert_Career4922,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dmbcd/im_assuming_i_should_give_up/,1690725576.0,1.0
"Who is more wrong in the my relationship or are we both morally grey and weirdly functional So my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 6 months, but she doesn’t seem interested in the relationship really, to the point where she keeps getting my name confused with ones that sound like it. She’s also been cheating on me, but I am not upset because I am just dating her to pacify my parents since she is very charming and they didn’t approve of my previous gf and were the reason we broke up, though we are also still seeing each other and technically cheating. I believe the only reason my gf is dating me is because her sister set us up on a blind date and she didn’t know that I was her sister's childhood bestfriend. When my gf got told that information, she kind of looked scared, I think because she also only went on the date to pacify her sister but couldn’t back out of dating me since my friend (her sister) is very overprotective of me and would’ve gone crazy on her. I know this because I overheard her talking to her friends saying how she doesn’t count what she’s doing as cheating because she feels backed into a corner and never wanted a relationship in the first place since she doesn’t do commitment or feelings. Normally If I heard that I would be a little iffy but how can I judge when I won’t breakup with the girl when I know she feels sort of trapped and am just using her as place holder till the timing’s right for me and my ex. So does anyone think that there is a person in the wrong in this situation? Neither one of us is abusive or mean towards the other; I think we enjoy each other’s company somewhat and the sex is great. We have an okay relationship other than the fact that she’s waiting for me to break up with her so she doesn’t get the heat from her sister, and I am waiting for the right time to break things off so that I can get back together with my previous GF. I know we are both wrong in our own ways and both should grow a back bone and breakup with one another but I think honestly maybe I should just tell her the whole deal.

"No second dates Hi I am 34 F , recently divorced, I have been going on these first dates with many men in past few months but I never get a single text afterwards from these men and they just disappear from my life. If I text them asking how they are doing etc , they do give me reply a polite reply back and thats it . It never goes anywhere after that. 

I am starting to wonder that What I am doing wrong on these first dates that I am not getting a single second date. After analyzing everything ,i think they might be turned off by my reluctance to take things physically forward so quickly. I am Indian and all these guys are Indian too so they know already I would not be moving to physical stuff so quickly. 

Another thing might be that they were shorter than they claimed to be in their profiles. I am 5’8 and in their profiles they mentioned they were 5’10 and above but in reality they were even shorter than me. I honestly had no problem even though they were lying but they were visibly uncomfortable about my height saying they didn’t expect me to be this tall. Claiming I am lying about my height , that its 5’10 or 5’11 at least. 

I also went on date with few men who dm me on instagram. They said that I look older in person than my pictures on Instagram. They said they liked my 5 years old pictures on Instagram and complained why I didn’t look like that anymore. I told I post my recent picture everyweek so they should have set their expectations accordingly. Nevertheless it had made me very insecure about my present looks.I cannot be as good looking as my 20 something old self. It is making me even more depressed .

"Need advice to approach a girl at workplace Hey all, I'm fairly new here, but I hope I'll get good advice here.  
  
I'm a 25 yr old guy working at a MNC in India. So I've never really been much into dating and stuff, but since a couple of months or more maybe, there's this girl at my workplace that I seem to be infatuated with. We work in different departments and don't have any mutual friends, the only place I see her is in cafeteria and that too with her gang of friends. I have observed that we both make a lot of eye contact and then suddenly look away, and I somehow feel she maybe interested as well, although might be wrong. About me, I look decent, have good height and personality (at least that's what I think), and am confident enough to be able to talk to girls and guys alike. I'm a bit of in between the old-school and modern gen kind of authentic yet adaptive guy. I think she is my kind as well at least based on what I observe and seems mature like me as well, who's not looking for anything casual but something meaningful.  
  
Now I am confused if and when should I approach her because she is always with her gang of friends so I don't get a chance to approach 1-1 even if I'm confident to approach. Also I'm not sure if I'm in hurry and I should give it more time and whether or not she might like it given she seems a bit of shy person as compared to me. Also given it's not college and we're in office, I can't ruin my (or her) career just because I couldn't hold my horses.  
I'd appreciate if men and women in this forum could help me out on when and how should I get a chance to talk 1-1 with her and how fast/slow should I take the conversations. I'm fine if she rejects my proposals and won't care to bother her or spam her again if she rejects me, but want to give a shot anyway, since I've never had such strong feelings for a girl before.  
  
PS: I want to date her with an intention of marriage. I understand that not all dating or relationships end up in marriage and I'm fine if later we figure out it won't work for some reason (like my first college date from few years ago), but the intention is not just short-term but for long lasting meaningful relationship that would lead us to spending lives together.

"(29F) I don’t know how to approach men in person to ask them out I’ve only dated guys that I’ve met on dating apps. But I’m sick of the apps not showing anymore profiles and taking my money that I need to save right now. So I want to meet guys in person.

I’m awkward when it comes to introducing myself. Once I get to know someone it’s easier to get into a good conversation. But I suck at flirting out of nowhere. 

As far as places go, I don’t drink due to medical reasons (so I’ve felt uncomfortable going to bars). I’m more artsy than a big sports fan, so I prefer to go to museums than games. Other than that, I like going to parks, coffee shops, and bookstores. I’m also going to start at the gym soon. So maybe that’ll help too. 

I was also recommended by another Reddit user to try dating an introvert given my past and personality.

So I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice for how to approach men, start a conversation, flirt, and where I could possibly find success.

"i don't know how to start again Its been 7 months since my first break up and I'm really struggling. My first love felt like it would never end and i didn't phrase it like it but i essentially told my then partner that they'd probably be my first and last, which looking back on is immature i know but i now feel like ive trapped myself in this promise that i feel too guilty to break. I also told myself i'd wait for a reaallly long time before i started dating again because during the height of the heartbreak i just found so many things wrong in a relationship i used to find so amazing, so i decided i was too immature and should take a good long break. But, there's a new person who is so sweet and lovely and they make me wanna try again, i love spending time with them and i genuinely think I'm falling in love again. Again, this may be such an immature take but I've never understood why other people date again after such heartbreak and pain, why should I give me heart away again after the uncertainty of losing another person?  I love really hard and earnestly and being vunerable with someone just to lose them again honestly scares me.

"No means No, Put on a condom means Put on a condom No means no, Put on a Condom Means Put on a Condom

Dated a dude for like 3 weeks. He was honestly so sweet and respectful so I was so caught off guard the last time we met.

We already started having sex just a couple days before, and I was clear I wanted to use condoms, which he said he was so happy about because he definitely wanted to use them too.

But after our first night having sex, I told him I've never had unprotected sex and I think it fucking blew a screw loose in his mind. Because the next time we were going to have sex he was about to enter me -- I tell him to please put a condom on. He says he will, he just wants to tease me a little more. Then he's about to try again, I tell him immediately again to put a condom on. He then just gets down on me and proceeds to try to start fucking me and coaxing me into it asking me to please let him because it will feel so good. I say no, speaking up for the 3rd time, and he finally gets off of me and puts a condom on. He was really staying turned on after moaning about  the fact that even though we wouldn't now how he could basically fantasize about us having unprotected sex in the future. I was confused by the end of the night and after he left it finally hit me what the fuck just happened.

I broke it off and just wanted to discuss what made him do that and let him know that was not okay, don't do that to anyone else. But just for the fact that he already knew I wasn't going to be with him anymore he didn't even give me the chance to express how his actions made me feel. It feels like someone just breaking my boundaries and then telling me I have to respect theirs by just shutting up so they don't have to deal with the pain they caused. His response as far as why he did it was to ask if it was such a big deal to lose the condom if we're both clean and I have an IUD. It's not that he couldn't have asked me, it's that you shouldn't ask me right as you're trying to force yourself on me, especially after me asking you to put a condom on twice,  AND already having discussed using condoms beforehand.

How can he talk like women's/reproductive rights are an area of interest to him and then do that shit to me. I've never had unprotected sex before, can you please let me choose when I have that experience instead of trying to steal that choice away from me?

Reported him on bumble and to the police.
I hope he never fucking does this shit again.

So disappointing that someone can come off like such a gem and then just disrespect your fucking heart and soul like that, just treating me like a fucking cavity to claim. Honesty, respect, empathy, is that so hard to give? I gave him more compassion even offering to just talk it over with him than that fucker even deserves with the way he responded to me.

"Is it unreasonable to expect your partner not to curse at you during an argument? 24F and 31M I've (24F) had a rocky online relationship with a man (31M) for a little over a month. Although it's been just a little over a month, it has felt super rocky with high highs and very low lows.  
  
  
  
I broke up with him today after he said ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you"" to me during an argument over something stupid. I also blocked him. He found another method to contact me and has stated that this was a misunderstanding and that I'm willing to throw away our relationship over one simple mistake.  
  
  
  
My thought is, can something like this really be labeled as a misunderstanding or a little slip up, as he seems to think it is? I've been in emotionally manipulative and abusive relationships before, and it feels like he's sorta belittling how dehumanizing it is to have your partner yell obscenities at you during an argument. It feels like he's minimizing the gravity of his actions as well as my feelings.  
  
  
  
Should I accept that this is just a slip up? Or is his behavior a red flag for things to worsen from here?  
  
  
  
I will say that the reason things have been so rocky is that he has been pressuring me for sex and emotionally whiplashing me over my need for patience. He himself has been emotionally volatile, lashing out at me and breaking up with me only to ask for me back after he calms down. He seems to think that all of his actions can be attributed to misunderstandings and slip ups, but I kinda don't think so. He seems to think I'm unreasonable for expecting to be treated better, that this is just normal for relationships.

"How do I get through this? PLEASE HELP: Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M21) broke up. We were together for 4 months and I don’t think I have the strength to get through this. He’s Muslim and I reverted to Islam in March and then met him. I know this is haram, but please give me advice because I really need it. He asked me about my past and I told him half of it out of shame, I altered numbers but told him enough to know what I did and the sins I had committed. I lied because I was ashamed and hated my past, but I felt guilty and so I told him everything. I revealed everything over time, I could never find the courage to say it all at once. He kept digging at my past asking for every detail and whenever I remembered any I told him. He made it very clear how important it was to him and the more I revealed the more he shamed me for my past. Over the past few months he has blamed me for the failing of our relationship and treated me differently. I took accountability and have tried earning his trust back and out of guilt I’ve eventually told him everything and he said he couldn’t forgive me. He has called me a horrible names, a liar, evil person, and made out as though I am the only one who has committed this lie. Two weeks ago I remembered something else from my past (I genuinely had forgotten and told him instantly because he has consistently asked me for the smallest of details regarding my past). He said he couldn’t forgive me, no matter how much I begged and pleaded. During our relationship he has wanted to leave me a number of times because of my past/lies. He told me a week later whilst we are on holiday that he had lied about how many people he had slept with (something which I hadn’t lied about I told him the truth about mine) and the amount really hurt me. He said he lied out of shame and guilt and then wanted to get back with me. I felt really hurt and as though he has enjoyed making me suffer for the past few months regarding my past. I feel he had been so unfair to me because he had treated me the way he has when all along he lied too and much worse. I was shocked, he felt no guilt at all no matter how many times I asked. In his defence he also asked me many times and I chose to reveal my past slowly bit by bit because I couldn’t take the judgment and shame it brought me. He forgave me everytime but I feel it was out of guilt because he was hiding so much more. I understand what I did was wrong, I thought I could conceal my past sins and only tell him enough to have a broad idea. I am hurt at how he used my past against me and I wouldn’t have done the same to him if I knew his past. I am hurt that he made me feel as though I am the only liar. I understand his reasons completely. Moving on, he begged for another chance (during the rest of our holiday) and I forgave him about a week later on the second day of returning. During that week I struggled to forgive him. He realised that how he treated me for the past 4 months for my lies despite lying himself, was narcissistic. The things that occurred and the way I was made to feel. It was narcissism and we both agreed on that. I felt he would always treat me with such unfairness. I understand why he lied, he felt ashamed and I love this man and so I dropped it. I’ve been really ill whilst the majority of this happened, I’ve had tonsillitis and otitis externa (ear infection) and on the day I got it (second last day of our holiday) he left me alone most the day. This was when I hadn’t given him the chance in his defence, we were broken up. He got me food when I asked and made me a cold flannel for my head, but left me alone 90% of the day and went out and had fun doing water activities. That same night he headed out at 11pm and I wanted to wait up for him. We were in a different country and I was worried for his safety. This same night he turned off his location and deleted all our pictures (he said it was because he felt hurt which I understand). I messaged him and he said he was safe and at a barber shop because he needed space (this was at 2am) because seeing me made him hurt as we were no longer together which again I understand. I couldn’t handle it, I went out to look for him as there were many barber shops nearby but couldn’t find him (he was at one deeper in town). I was in tears the whole time. I was begging him to reply to me and after an hour of texts he came home. I lost it and asked how he could put me through everything. I’ve felt worried, untrusting of him, ill, and betrayed. I began cursing at him when he said he’s done nothing wrong (something which we didn’t do in our relationship). We had a big argument, horrible things were said from us both including me and the next day we headed home. He pleaded for a chance this day and I rejected it, I wanted him and love him but the pain felt too much. A day later I’ve given him this chance and I’m still ill and he comes to see me to take care of me. As soon as I gave him the chance things were starting to go wrong. I felt a lot of the rules we had during the relationship were made out of control, something he acknowledged and agreed on. I scrapped our rule of getting home by a certain time (10:30pm) and said not to take the mick with it, I’m just removing it to make it a variable time to get home because things can be unexpected. We have never gone out late with our friends or came back at crazy times. I was happy with coming home by 10:30, but I felt the rule was out of control on his part and I wanted to shake that feeling. The next day he goes out with his friends and comes home at 2:30am. I wasn’t okay with this and explained to him how I said we weren’t going to take advantage with it and just once in a blue moon will come home after midnight. I also said I didn’t expect you to hop on it straight away as we have making up to do. The next day he messages me telling me he’s going out (it’s 10:30pm) and didn’t give me a time as to when he’d be back. I expressed I wasn’t okay with this and was starting to worry because I thought he was up to something. He was going with friends I’ve never heard of and they were going to a park to just chill. I wasn’t okay with it and he went anyways. I broke up with him and blocked him on everything, I felt like my emotional needs would never be taken into consideration and that he didn’t care about me anymore. The next day I found myself missing him like crazy, I’ve fallen in love with this man and can’t understand how things went so wrong. We’re so compatible and have felt like best friends since we’ve met. The whole of yesterday and last night I was messaging him begging for us to work through this. I went to see my friends but left early as I needed to be alone. He expressed how he felt I had given up on him and he doesn’t want this anymore. I have been completely lost, I’ve felt uncared for and disrespected and completely lost but understand he feels given up on. He blocked me on absolutely everything but left me on Twitter and so I messaged him carrying on. He rang me, told me he misses me and I carried on pleading. He said he needs until Wednesday (3 days away) till decide. What do I do? I can’t imagine life without him and I’m really struggling to deal with everything. Please give me advice.

"How to NOT be a friend material while also NOT being an a**hole? I’ve been broken up with my girlfriend for couple of years already and since then couldn’t find anyone who would share the same interests and stuff while also sharing the same feeling and being sexually attracted with me. There were girls I liked (Most of them I met through dating apps) but they all preferred to be friends rather than having a relationship.

There were also girls who told me straight that I’m so sweet and they like communicating with me so much that it makes them look at me as a friend only and don’t have any desire to be together as partners. There were also some of them who mentioned they were searching for a sex partner. Either ONS or benefits but they still don’t want to have it with me even though I’m not against it as well. They just see me as a friend and I don’t know how to get out of this curse. I really can’t naturally talk to them in a non-friendly way. I’m indeed a very friendly person if I open up with a girl and every time I talk to them naturally, I sure am friendly. I think I would look like an a**hole and unnatural if I talk differently and in fact, I don’t even know how to talk to them anymore. I’ve got just enough friends to live my life and what I emotionally or physically need is a relationship partner but don’t know anymore if I’m able to find one because of all those stuff I’ve mentioned.

"Hurt and confused This is decently long, but like the title says I'm really not doing too well and I really need some support. To anyone who read this. Thank you.

I haven't dated in around a year, by choice. I really liked who I became while being alone but recently I met someone. She's everything that I could ever imagine and more. And we've been dating for a short time but in the beginning she showed a lot of interest in me and wanting to be together as much as possible. And it was very nice, to be wanted just for who I was. We went slow all the way. Hugs to hand holding to kisses, to cuddling together till we fell asleep. I was falling in love fast. She really is special. Once we were talking about past relationships. She mentioned how someone asked her for a chance once he found out she was available, she said she wouldn't give him a chance and we kinda laughed. I asked her half joking if I had a chance. She said yes. Which made me very happy. 

Today we went to see a movie. While sitting I had a piece of candy on my lips that I wanted to share like those cheesy scenes in romances where you end up kissing. It was a playful thing but was I saw in her face was disgust. In that moment I just knew it was coming. 

We got back to her room and after some small talk she says there was something we needed to talk about.
She proceeds to tell me that while she likes to hang out and thinks I'm a cool guy, she's not ready to be anything serious. She tells me how she had been recently hurt and she doesn't know if she'll be ready for another serious relationship for a long time. It could be a year from now a week from now, she said. 
I told her I understood. 
She tells me that she hopes she wasn't leading me on and that she wants things to stay the same as in, cuddles and kisses. But nothing more serious than that. That she doesn't want to be in love and have to be thinking what that other person could be doing when they're apart. 
I told her that I understood, thanked her for her honesty. I said to her that I still wanted to be with her but I know understood where the line is.
We hugged and I left. 

I'm really really hurt. And I don't know how to deal with this. 
I'm writing this to ask about your experiences. To any women reading this, does it sound off? Is she lying to me? Is there a chance, and is it even worth it for me?

"Just turned 29 and I'm honestly terrified I won't find anyone I broke up with my last GF almost 3 years ago and since then dating has been extremely unpleasant.

I've always wanted to have my own family and I actually thought it would happen way earlier, but I keep having shit luck at dating. Even when it feels I'm doing everything right, and it gets me severe anxiety at times because I feel I'm just missing my chance. I just turned 29 and feel it gets harder and harder.

I struggled with image issues for most of my 20s, until last year when I started taking care of my body and grooming myself better. Now I think I'm slightly above average in looks and that I have a nice personality. Since this year I've actually managed to hook up with extremely attractive girls, but even though they say later that I'm great and attractive and funny and that the sex was great, none are interested in continuing.

I was dating this girl for a few months who I DIDN'T meet on a dating app and I thought she was it, it was going great, she was messaging me on her own daily, we'd talk for hours, have great dates, but she just told me that she's actually ""not a labels person"" because she's afraid ""a relationship will affect the stability of her llfe"" and also that she cannot see herself in a relationship where she has to meet her partner more than once a week.

"As a man how can you build confidence dating when dating is damaging your confidence So im M21 and i would say i 5-6 years ago i was somewhat confident, could start conversations with people would have a laugh be a bit cheeky and connect with people better overall

But whilst trying to find someone i found my confidence was crushed because after several rejections and no successes and added pressure from friends (im the only one in my friend group whos never been with a girl before) i felt incompetent in that area and that reduced my confidence and it had a snowballing effect on me, like now at a lower level of confidence its harder and then when you hear women say “confidence is key” is debilitating because i feel like how am i supposed to walk away unscathed from being rejected all the time. 

Its like imagine getting handed test scores for a math test only to find out you did far worse than everyone else , are you telling me youd not be less confident to answer a math question if asked in front of the class knowing you performed miles worse than your peers?

And for me its the same with dating as everything else in life you assess your performance and make judgments based on your capabilily. 

It got to a point where i feel so unsure of myself. Ive become very awkward and i only really speak when spoken to nowadays because i feel like im getting in peoples way or im being an inconvenience to them.  And i recognise thats not a good  place to be because you need to be able to communicate but its like nothing comes to mind anymore it feels like everything i say is pointless and just a waste of time.  Im just a spectator in life now its literally a movie i just look at what foes in around but i no longer engage with the world. It like i gradually shut away certain aspects of me and now its like i forgot who i used to be after silencing my self for long.

I think the fact that he was leaving was what fueled my longing for him - that and I got along with him very well.

Now, after no contact for 6 months, I’ve been on several dates with really great guys who are kind, sweet and normal but I just never feel the spark. The last 2 guys that I thought were interesting were both extremely unavailable: 1) just got out of a long term relationship and 2) currently in a long term relationship and believes cheating on his girlfriend is equivalent to watching corn.

She said ""yes"".

That being said. She is very loving towards me. Whenever we don't talk for more than a few hours. She will text me. Professing her love. 
She tends to do this if i fall asleep. And i would wake up with lots of text from her saying how much she loves me and she gets worried I would leave her.

"She chose him… Stay friends? Or move on Or cut ties…

I’ve been numb since a few days ago.

For the past year I’ve been romantically, physically and emotionally involved with a young woman in an open relationship.

In the beginning, she was taken. When we first met and started getting closer she “made an agreement” to open the relationship to be with me.

At first, it felt like we were dating. Then gradually over time, she became less and less available. I got the gist. She figured things out with her man and is done with me.

Last week, we met after not seeing each other for a while. We got dinner, i took her to a surprise show she always wanted to go to, and took her home. When we got there i tried to kiss her and she said “I can’t”

she began to almost cry and said that she likes me but she’s with her man. And that i make her the happiest she’s ever been. And that I shouldn’t ‘wait’ for her. She’s moving back to her hometown 4 hours away in a few weeks anyway.

"The guy I’m seeing is going on a reality tv dating show I have been seeing someone for a short amount of time. We both agreed that we wanted to take things slow, but I’ve been sure to clearly communicate that I am dating with intention and that I am physically and mentally prepared for a serious relationship. 

We text every day and our dates have been
so fun and we have both expressed how deeply we’ve connected. 

He’s tall, dark, handsome, extremely smart and successful in so many ways (currently obtaining huge national awards, magazine covers, etc). He’s an incredible person I have the utmost respect for him.

I found out he is soon to participate in a reality tv show in which a woman will pick a suitor. 

I don’t like to make assumptions, but I wish he had been more forthcoming on why he wanted to go slow, as the show must be an enormous, primary influence on that. He must be ready to be in a relationship if he is joining a show like this and it doesn’t match what he told me. 

As disappointed as I am, it is clear I should not
pursue this anymore and I will no longer try to romantically connect with him, but I’d like to keep him in my life as a friend. 

I am conflicted on whether to express my
feelings about the show or not. Do I tell him now that I just want to be friends? Do I continue to date him and wait until it’s closer to the show beginning? I don’t want to do anything that would jeopardize the chance of a friendship.

"How do I (m28) get intimate with my date (f24) and do you think she wants more than friendship? Hi,  I (m28) have always had problems getting intimate with a woman and  kissing her. I am 28 and have only had one relationship. My ex made it  even harder for me because she had some childhood trauma (and also cried  after sex because of it).

I get on dates reasonably well, can generate sympathy and am not extremely shy. But I can't make the next step.

Now,  finally, there is another woman (f24) I like. That never really  happened since my ex. I find her attractive, we share some interests and  she is chilled out. I met her through Bumble. We have met 4 times so  far and nothing has happened yet.

The  first time we met we went to several bars. The second date we had ice  cream. Now things are getting a little weird. Afterwards we talked about  kinks and ""money slaves"". She found it interesting and funny. I then  got her a ""cash and go"" meeting through another app. A guy met with her  and paid her 50 euros. We both found the experience exciting and she  tells me a lot about it.

Then we  had a 4th meeting at my house. We ate pizza and sat next to each other  on my couch for 3 hours. I often touched her thigh, tried to build up  closeness, but did not have the impression as if she wanted to kiss  me.After the meeting she also contacted me again. I slowly think I'm  slipping into the friend zone, but really want more.

The  chats are very basic. So real enthusiasm does not want to arise from  both sides. But I am also not the chat type. She has really given no  indication at all that she wants to be kissed and I am finding it hard  to take the initiative. She has mentioned once that she is also looking  for friends through Bumble. She also wants to go out partying with me  sometime.

Do you think she sees the whole thing only friendly?

"Times have changed, and id like to get some general advice to start dating again. After my (24m) last relationship Ive spent about 4 years working on myself, learning to be comfortable who i am, and trying to get rid of/learn to live with the baggage ive gathered. I wouldnt say im completely successful, but im atleast willing to try again. Growth and healing is fine, but its cost plenty of time and ive noticed an issue because of it. 

The issue is how much my own generation has seemingly gone full turncoat on each other and would rather treat dating as a means to an end. I know ive been under a rock for 4 years, but in that short time its almost become celebrated to treat your partner all kinds of wrong all while youre expected to take it not just by them, but society as a whole. It doesnt help that the criteria for what a ""good man"" is changes on the whim of whatever titktok these folks are cramming down their gullet that day. The expectations placed on people nowadays are seemingly WAY different and its like its impossible to approach anyone without seeming like some kind of creep or horndog. 

Ive tried a handful of times, offline and online, to at the least just talk with someone only to get ghosted, insulted, lied to, or led on completely. I definetly want to try again, as itd be foolish to assume that ALL women treat men like this. its just rough to be seen as some kind of predator or mark rather than as a man who just wants to cuddle and talk about his nerdy object collection.  

But even through all this change, i still want to find someone. All i need is a little help from people who've navigated this new confusing dating pool 😅 so any advice would be appreciated.",PseudoGobbo,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dc0hx/times_have_changed_and_id_like_to_get_some/,1690690831.0,1.0

"31F Avoided relationships due to mental health issues. Probably NSFW Throw away account for obvious reasons. I'm attracted to children. It's not something I've acted on or will act on and as much as I wanted a family, I won't be having children.

It didn't really sink in that I was a pedo until I was around twenty-one. I don't know why I'm like this, there's nothing I can point to in my childhood and say this is why I'm fucked up. I've also been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was twelve.


Things have been getting better for me over the last few years and my depression is much more manageable. I would like to have a normal relationship eventually, but I don't know if that's possible.


Is this something that would be okay to hide from a SO? I feel like it wouldn't be fair to keep this from someone I'm in a relationship with, but I'm terrified of being outed.


Would anyone stay with their SO if they found out they were attracted to children, but hadn't acted on it? I want one person in my life that I don't have to hide things from for them to still love me.

"Some advice on core values in long term relationships Hi all, I’ve been in a healthy and fulfilling relationship for the last 3.5yrs. My boyfriend (for this post we’ll call him John) and I met right before the pandemic on Tinder of all places.

For this post, I wanted to touch on one aspect of our relationship that I think helped us a lot: complimentary core values. Hopefully by putting my thoughts to text, I can help you as well.

Basically, **don’t think about politics**– think about what *leads* to politics. Do you hold equality as key and so push for communism? Do you believe that a relationship with a deity is paramount, and so hold religious teachings above the wants and needs of any given individual?

My boyfriend and I both hold freedom for the individual as a core value. His reasoning led him to libertarianism while it led me to liberalism. These are different politics and we’ve had a lot of debates on the merits of each and our conclusions on different issues. Because we were both starting from a core value of freedom for the individual, though, we are able to have a more stable relationship.

If I was a very devout Muslim who held my relationship with Allah above all (core value) and wanted to impose Sharia Law (politics) while John retained his individualist values and libertarian politics– this would lead to a lot of arguing. If neither of us changed our core values, it would put massive strain on our relationship.

Core values are where relationships make or break. If your values conflict, you will eventually have problems. Opinions and preferences (I think chocolate is gross, he loves it) really don’t matter to the stability of the relationship so long as they’re respected as opinions and preferences.

How do you understand your partner’s core values? Simple– ask! When John and I were getting to know each other on a deeper level, we watched those Jubilee Middle Ground videos to start conversations. We’d take IDR Labs tests for the same reason.

Yes, a lot of these conversations got heated. We’d yell, “How can you believe that?! Insane!!” but always end the conversations with, “Love you, by the way!” so we knew there were no hard feelings.

The only reason we were able to have these conversations is because we knew ourselves. We knew who we were, who we wanted to be, and WHY. You have to put in the work to understand your value system before you start dating. If you or your partner don’t, hash it out over a few months, just be respectful about it.",RadioSphinx,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d7d0f/some_advice_on_core_values_in_long_term/,1690676628.0,1.0

"Shy girl gave me her number, but I'm struggling to get her to come out of her shell I sat next to her in our college classes. We had some pleasant conversations, but she was clearly very quiet, shy, and nervous. I asked her out but she said she was busy. I interpreted that as a complete rejection and I didn't ask again because I didn't want her to feel pressured or harassed. One semester later she chooses to sit next to me again during another class. We talk more, and on the last day of class she gives me her number without my asking because she wants to keep in touch with me.  
We've been texting over the summer. I try to ask her intelligent questions that will help me get to know her, while also showing that I'm interested in her. She says she likes texting with me, but her responses, while friendly, are often very delayed and brief. I asked her if she would be open to talking on the phone but she said she was too nervous.  
Summing up: What is a good way to connect with a person who is reaching out to me, but is at the same time very shy and reticent? The mixed signals are confusing. Normally I'd use more humor, but since she won't even talk on the phone, I can't really get a feel for her specific sense of humor or when a joke is landing/falling flat.

"Help!!!! What do I do. I’m a 47 divorced female.  I have been texting and FaceTiming with a man I met on tinder since 2018. at the time we both understood that we were not interested in a relationship. I gave him my number and would text interactive romantic, passionate fantasies every once in a while, they got progressively more intimate through out the years.  last year I met someone different and started going on dates. I recieved an IM from my friend from tinder and told him I had met someone and thought that I could probably get into a relationship with this new person.  that is when he opened up and said that he wanted to be my FB. even though, through out all these years we had messaged about meeting our schedules never opened up.  throughout the years our desires got deeper for each other we did finally meet and had a very passionate romantic day my desires were met but had room for more.  after that we went back to the same sporadic romantic passionate communication we had prior. then he stopped for months,  I was hardly the woman that would make the first text out of respect for his young  children,  in case they had his phone.  one  night I worked the nerve and messaged him.  he replied and informed me he had moved out of state. we chatted that night and have been sporadically chatting and FaceTiming every once in a while again. I find this man very attractive, our way of interacting with these fantasies and our one passionate get together made me feel that maybe we could be more than this whatever we have. the last time we interacted,  he mentioned he was dating and thought he was ready for a relationship.  I told him I was dating but was very disappointed in the men that I was going out with.  he gave me advice for my next date,  I followed his advice, it did not work to say the least.  when I reached out to tell him his advice did not go so welll.  he replied with an emoji that implied that he was happy the date did not workout  I am confused on what this man wants.  he implies he wants me to go out with others and yet seems to get more active when I’m moving on towards my goal of a relationship.  he says he is ready for a relationship and dating but yet gives me mixed messages.

"Will my living situation repel women if I put myself out there? I am a 27M and I would like some preferably female input regarding my lifestyle and living situation in regards to how (un)attractive it makes me in the dating market. 

I have little dating experience outside of a couple hook ups and 1 month “relationships” in high school. Since then many things have happened that led to to mostly giving up on ever finding a partner to start a family with. For as long as I can remember I have wished to experience the joys of fatherhood but I also told myself long ago that if I ever had children, I would need to still be young and healthy enough with enough energy to be an active participant in my child’s life. Meaning that I gave myself a time limit. If by 30 years of age I wasn’t a Father or soon to be one, I would give up on that dream. 

Which brings us to why I’m here today. I’m becoming increasingly aware of how my impending 3rd decade of life is quickly approaching, and that I must act just as quickly if I am ever to achieve the future I want. However, I also don’t want to waste my time, money and effort if it turns out that there’s no way a woman would date a man in my situation. 

I am 6ft and weigh 240lbs, average to below average looks, I work 5 days, 50 hours a week making deliveries in my car for a legitimate cannabis company. I own my own car, a 2022 Honda Civic and I make almost 60K a year. However I am currently co-renting a 2-story 5 Bed 3 Bath house with my parents as well as my (25) younger brother and his wife with 2 dogs as well. Moving out is not an option as I am an active contributor in the household beyond simply paying rent. I spend my free time buying and reading manga (I have 3 bookshelves and counting full of volumes I’ve purchased) watching anime and playing video games. My greatest talent is my singing voice, I am professionally trained having gone to an arts high school, had several lead roles in theatre productions. I hate to sound like I’m bragging but it’s what I’m most proud of so I thought I should at least mention it. I only have 2 close friends and only 1 of them I see regularly where we hang out at his place where we smoke weed, watch anime and play video games (I know, my life isn’t very exciting) My work hours are from 1pm-11pm and I usually have 2 weekdays off so I don’t ever really have the opportunity to go out and enjoy the nightlife like most people do. I also don’t like to drink that much so I usually have a drink once every few months on special occasions. This is all I can think of about myself off the top of my head, I can answer questions about myself if this isn’t enough to go off of. 

So yeah, that’s the short of it. I’m under no delusion that my situation is in any way ideal for a woman looking to date a man. I am aware of how boring and uninteresting I come off to most people. I would just like some general opinions, do I have a modicum of a chance, or should I accept the fact that it’ll be nearly impossible to find a woman looking to start a family that is also willing to settle for someone like me and give up on having children? 

TL;DR 
Is someone who rents a house with their parents and sibling and his wife, spends their free time collecting manga and playing video games too undesirable to date regardless of having a full time job and a slightly above average income?",InsecureDriver,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dey4s/will_my_living_situation_repel_women_if_i_put/,1690700719.0,0.67

I turned him down about a week ago and he was very understanding and kind, but it's obvious he's switched to friends only mode. We don't talk as much and I saw that he's already updated his dating profile a bit. Which is ofc, totally normal considering that's what would be expected given what I said.

"I keep thinking about a guy I had a situationship with &amp; wondering if I should tell him how I feel Our 2-month situationship was 2 years ago and we haven’t talked since, but we still follow each other on social media even though we both unfollow our exes. In many ways, what we shared was more romantic/beautiful than some of the official relationships I’ve had. It started nonchalantly on a dating app we were trying out to casually chat with new people as the pandemic dragged on. Literally just to talk, not to hook up. We messaged for the 1st month and weren’t planning on meeting until we realized how much we like each other. He told me he got excited whenever I messaged him.

Then I initiated our 1st videochat which happened to be on Valentine’s Day and was really fun. A month later, we met in person twice and it was like a dream. We biked, cooked, watched tv, cuddled/kissed and led to 3rd base. He comforted me when I lost a loved one which meant a lot to me. We had happy hours and played word games. What I didn’t like though is that he is very sexual and wanted to watch porn together or have phone sex with toys during our chats, so I wasn’t surprised he wanted to have sex in person but I declined and he took it well. We were happy to just spend time together and finally meet after a build-up.

The sad yet also romantic part is that he was about to move away and any relationship for us would be starting long distance. He said he would’ve asked me on a real date if that wasn’t the case. I had to step away earlier than he expected because I was developing feelings for him. He didn’t know that was the reason; I just told him I thought it’d be better this way since we couldn’t start a relationship anyway. Not long after that, he got into a relationship with this new chick and it broke my heart. Even if we weren’t talking, I didn’t expect him to move on so soon.

I recently moved to his favorite neighborhood (where we met, not where he moved to) and find myself thinking of him more. I never got over him and I think he’s single now. But I’m so afraid that he just said all those sweet things to keep me talking to him until he left. And that he just sees me as a hook-up. And that I would be making a fool of myself telling him how I feel and that it’s just me having a stupid crush. I also worry that his career is entirely different from mine, and practically speaking I’m not sure how sustainable it will be. What do you think I should do? Any advice or insight?

"She said that it was just a summer thing but the thing we’re doing right now seems like boyfriend a girlfriend thing. Should I be straight forward and ask her what does she wants in this “thing” that we have? Because we’re not having sex (even though at first she said she wanted a hookup) and it’s just getting way too romantic for it to be a summerfling.

I (M18) met this girl (F18) during a friend hangout. We hit off and generally have a good time. At first I didn’t want to take thing serious and just want a summer fling. I then found out from a mutual friend that she also want the same thing. I then asked her if she wanted to hangout. We then kissed by the end of the hangout. Fast forward me and the same group hangout again this time with her. This time we both gotten really drunk. We then proceed to have a full on make out session. The furthest I have went was grabbing her chest, nothing more than that but we did made out for 2 hours straight. During the made out she told me that she loved me but I didn’t take it too serious as we were both drunk and she take those words back right away. 

We then hang out afterwards again but this time the kissed just doesn’t feel the same. It was a lot more passionate, the type of kissed you would get from a relationship. 

We would then start face-timing each-other frequently and even sleep calls. During one of the call she asked if i’m looking for something serious i then told her it’s too early to say. I asked her the same question and she said the same thing I said.

Now after multiple facetiming, we would facetime for hours, I then realize i’m falling for this girl. I would then ask her the same question she asked me earlier which was “are you looking for something serious”. She would then respond “It’s summer”. Implying that she don’t want it to be serious. I think that she knows that i’m starting to have feelings for her because I was a lot more invested into it. 
After all of this she still let me kissed her. 

So how do I tell her that I want more than kissing and making out (having sex) or tell her that I like her and make it serious. Neither is fine with me, I just don’t know how to approach this situation.

"I have a feeling that I want to commit suicide over one girl. some backstory, my girlfriend and I broke up around 4 days ago (not a long time, i know that) because she would rather spend time with her friends and only speak to me 5 minutes a day. Which i said that i wasn’t comfortable with and I need more time with her, in response she said “i dont care about your feelings”. This hurt me but i am so in love with this girl i held on for another 2 weeks and it got worse. She ignored me for days and said hurtful comments. So i broke up with her. She didn’t care stating “okay, i dont love you any more bro” and sending memes about how i am in pain. Which hurt because i’d think a 1 year relationship would mean something.

And now I’m scared i’ll do something terrible to myself after that.

When I saw the look her face. I knew it was going to be combative and it was going to be excruciating at times. 

For the first 10mins she just spoke quite angrily that I didn't show much in her opinion that I reciprocated her. Unfortunately she kept talking over me and cutting me off. I couldn't get a word in to explain. She loved getting the last word over me so I just let her have her Monologue. She spoke quite belligerent to be honest. It wasn't nice to hear. But I listened. And took on board the criticism leaved at me.

She then asks me directly. Do I even like her?
And I tell her that I am but I want to take things very, very casually. Then of course she fucking cuts me off and this really, really fucks me off. To segment things a say and not listen to Me in my entirely is unfair. I raise my voice and not word for word but I tell in essence to fuck off if she won't give me the opportunity/courtesy of speaking. Thankfully she listens. Finally. 

I explain that I didn't feel comfortable reciprocating her touching me and talking about sex given she was drunk. And she surprisingly said she wasn't exactly drunk which I didn't bothering arguing with her about since she was being templemental so I just essentially said I wasn't being rude or ignoring her. I just didn't think she was being serious when she said she wanted sex. She says it was obvious that it was Ok. 

We then talked about a few things and she asks me is it an 'issue that she's a virgin'?

And looking back. Not saying my spine turned to jelly but I probably should have been more forthright in my response. 

I told her 'not really'. But I'd happily have sex with her. I joke about make up sex being the best sex and she laughs which help elevate the mood. I then joke about being the sexist man alive which again gets a funny response and makes me feel lighter about everything.

I explain to her that I want to take things day by day. I tell we are still a huge way off boyfriend and girlfriend. Which she thankfully understood. She then tells me she's not seeing anyone or even speaking. Which I find encouraging.

She tells me she's happy after talking and that we should take a few days break of talking and 'definitely see each other again'. I tell her I agree. We then embrace and I plant a kiss on her left cheek. I then walk her out and say bye. She then audaciously give me a full on quick kiss on my lips as she leaves the main apartment building. I just laugh. You couldn't write it🤣🙈. Quite cheeky. Even hours later I'm still questioning if that actually happened! 

 And that's that. I feel like someone hit me with a baseball bat mid sleep. But there's a understanding now. And that's crucial.

Obviously I didn't like the shouting and vitriol from her. But she got her point across.",Formal-Crab-181,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15czoiq/the_update_with_me_22m_and_the_19w_year_old/,1690656448.0,0.77

I (23F) asked this guy I knew (26M) if he was down to help me get sexual experience and he agreed. I have tons of anxiety about sex and he was very comforting and made me feel safe. We talked everyday for like 2-3 months, hooked up, and were becoming good friends. 

We started doing stuff that teetered into relationship category, and he got super mad when confronted about it. He told me I was thinking too hard and being extra, but we never really talked about stuff beforehand, and he's the one who claimed he was very experienced.

"Would you pay for a set number of matches for a DA? 
The problem with all dating apps are that men heavily outnumbered women. Women has thus become too selective due to a sea of options but lack of quality, and men has become desperate and swipes right too easily.

 A dating app should somehow take into account this inherent gender ratio imbalance to increase match quality, to the benefit of both genders. To that I have some ideas:

- Severely limit the number of matches a person can concurrently have ( 1 or 2) . If they match with someone they are out of the swipe pool. -&gt; should make men much more selective.

- Monetization model should be based on number of matches instead of monthly subscription model. So say you pay 15$ for 5 matches. The match only counts after some minimum number of back and forth conversation. You get refunded if the profile is later reported and flagged as bot.

- The app should be free for women (to attract them using the app, to the benefit of men)

- Due to the change in monetization model the app can make  available all the features normally reserved for premium users of other dating apps (all kinds of filters, see who likes you, statistics, etc,...)

Do you think the above ideas can work? Do you have other suggestions?",the_people_developer,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d5ji0/would_you_pay_for_a_set_number_of_matches_for_a_da/,1690671552.0,1.0
"Go From Talking Every Day To Not At All, Need Advice So I'll preface by saying I've \[30M\] only been seeing ""C"" \[26F\] for a couple of weeks,  but I haven't honestly navigated this type of scenario in god knows how  long so I need a bit of advice (or just re-assurance maybe). C and I went on a date two-ish weeks ago, and honestly I've never had more sparks fly; we ended up talking until the restaurant closed and she was the one to kiss me when we went to say goodbye, pretty good start right? Next day we ended up calling and chatting for a bit on the phone again, getting to know each other more. 

I had bought tickets for Oppenheimer and we were supposed to see them two days after the first date, but it turns out I had bought them for the wrong day, we ended up going out to eat, and afterwards sat in my car cuddling and talking for another three hours. We end up both sharing some traumas (her more so than myself), but overall still a great time. Next three days we repeat the same process, call at night to talk or a date (she came over for the next two and we just chilled), incredibly intimate experience but not much sexual (due to aforementioned traumas, we had a little bit of fun). This girl has literally said ""I wish I could stay here forever"" while laying on my chest, and I took that as a pretty good sign; I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive as a result - obviously it hadn't been very long but considering how things were progressing it didn't feel too out of place. I will say that I told her (and anyone I date) that I'm a bit more traditional and only date one person at a time, I get if they don't want to do that as well obviously though and am cool with that. Anyways after asking, she said she wasn't ready for that and we left it as is and left shortly after.  


Since then it's been close to radio silence, maybe one or two texts back and forth a day - we weren't texting a lot but it was more than that. She has been busy with seeing out of state friends for the past 3-4 days, but it's jarring to me that we went from being that close to near radio silence. Am I reading too much into it or do we take it as a sign that she lost interest due to asking to be exclusive too soon?

"Why do I lose interest, when they begin to show interest? I (19F) have never been in a serious relationship with a guy, but I have been in quite a few situationships. Back in January, I fell for a guy I was really good friends with. Once things started to heat up and get serious, and he started to openly show interest in me, all of the feelings I had for him disappeared. When he would complement me it gave me the “ick”. I am not sure if this is due to my past experiences with men or what, but it makes me feel as though I am leading these men on. When in reality I have no clue why this is happening. This has happened twice recently and it makes me feel terrible that I am basically playing with these men’s emotions when I don’t even mean to.

"The call lasted for an hour and it made me unmatch and cancel our date, was I too harsh? TLDR: As the title states. 

I (F21) recently scheduled a date with a man (M21) to meet at a local coffee shop for our first date. It would’ve been my first date ever. But I cancelled it after I called him. 
My date was open about being autistic, i didnt mind as my very close cousin is also autistic. He explained in the phone call that he was high functioning and “knew how to read social cues unlike a lot of others”. I assumed he was making a lil joke and giggled but he then got offended by my laughing. I apologized and to make things less awkward, I started asking him questions about his hobbies and interests. He then went on a rant that almost lasted for an hour about Star Wars. I kept trying to say something during it all but he kept spitting out random facts about Star Wars so I couldn’t. He would interrupt me and then after listening to random Star Wars facts, he finally let me speak and I didn’t wanna give up hope and started talking about one of my interests. I would occasionally ask questions for him to let him have a turn to speak but I got nothing but silence on the other end. I asked if he was there and he finally spoke and said that he was, the whole thing felt really awkward and I excused myself by saying I needed to take a shower and hung up. I then unmatched us.


Was I too harsh? I know people with autism get excited about their special interests but my cousin is also high functioning and is aware of taking turns talking in a conversation.

"how many dates until this is a bad sign How many dates until it’s a red flag that there’s still not been a kiss

So i’m fairly young here i’m talking to this girl and she’s admitted to me she likes me and i like her back we’ve been talking for about a month we met first on our college taster day and i walked her home and i tried to kiss her as i always kiss the first time i meet so it’s obvious to them i still like them romantically after meeting in person however she moved away, she said she was really sorry and sent a lot of messages saying she was just nervous because she really likes me so i just brushed it off as she has only kissed one other boy compared to my seven girls so i wasn’t too worried although it did feel bad. so we went out again today and it was like a proper date we went to a nice restaurant and the movies however not once did we touch at all or kiss so i’m abit worried now as i’d think by the second time we’d at least touch each other especially at the movies, the worst thing is whenever i touch her in a non romantic way like i had to guide her body in a crowd so i used my hand and she kind of froze and i’m worried if she’s just disgusted by me touching her or something

when we spoke about the first kiss rejection she said next time would be different and after the nerves of the first meeting went she’d start the kiss since she rejected me first time but in the movies she seemed really closed off like she didn’t want to be touched, i kept looking to see if i could put my arm around her but the way she was sat made it impossible and like she didn’t want to anyway. i’ve never had this before and it’s starting to effect the way i am with her, i understand sometimes people wait to kiss but the no touch really amplifies this for me

"Feeling hopeless about romance I am almost 20 and I still haven’t had a single romantic encounter. No one has ever really liked me, I’ve never held hands, and never had my first kiss. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m unattractive or just uninteresting/annoying.

I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I assume it could be my appearance, something to do with my weight or the fact that I’m taller. I’ve had friends tell me that guys may find me intimidating or unapproachable. I just don’t understand what about me is so unappealing to everyone.

"been going out for almost 3 months, not sure what he wants I have been seeing the same guy since early May. In May he told me that he likes me a lot and we have been going out on dates nearly every week in the month of May and half of June. However, mid June, we went three weeks without hanging out. He was spending every weekend with his friends. I initiated the next date. We then went out again the following week, and last friday. we were supposed to hang out this Monday, however, he got called into work so he said if we can reschedule however he hasn’t rescheduled anything for this week. He was out with his friends yesterday and I think he’s going to be out with them again today too. 

We’ve been spending a lot of time together, and I thoroughly enjoy spending time with him and now I’m kind of wanting some sort of exclusiveness with him. I want to have this conversation with him however, I also feel like it’s pointless because we’ve been going out for almost 3 months and he hasn’t brought anything up about being exclusive or in a relationship. I feel like if he wanted something more serious, he would’ve brought it up right now.

I noticed that I haven’t been receiving the exact same level of effort as the beginning. In the beginning we would hang out a lot like more than once a week. However, now we hang out maybe once a week (which im perfectly fine with) howe, it seems like he has a lot of time for his friends on the weekends. sometimes I think he’s not as interested anymore but then he tells me things how he’s going to help me move into my apartment next month and cook me dinners which seems pretty intimate to me. he also continues to keep conversation with me daily and when we hang out in person he’s very kind and sweet.  I want to have the conversation. However a part of me also knows that it could either go good or bad and if it goes bad I might not see him again out of awkwardness. I feel like if he wanted me to be his girlfriend he would’ve said something by now.

But now things feel weird ,maybe it’s me dealing with the rejection but the energy feels off and I don’t know what to do to make it go away and so that things don’t stay awkward and we’re about to spend the whole day together and I’m freaking out a bit… Any advice will be helpful.",Royal-Marketing4544,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cuemo/i_25f_kisses_my_best_friend26m_and_i_think_i_made/,1690642863.0,0.84
Is being a 27 year old virgin repulsive to females? I’m curious to know if being a 27 year old virgin scares away a woman or does a woman feel more attracted to a virgin? I’m an introvert and I am not much of a person to go out and party or be wild. I just choose to not be a part of this culture of hooking up. I’d rather be with someone and it be real is that to hard to ask for?,Troyy24,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cbima/is_being_a_27_year_old_virgin_repulsive_to_females/,1690584020.0,0.84

"Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place? I’m confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don’t do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I’ve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I’m confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Is she really just looking for a place to stay and this is something friends do? Is there a chance something romantic could happen when she visits?",jbsIV,229,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c85r4/why_would_a_girl_that_rejected_me_ask_to_stay_at/,1690575877.0,0.93

I block people after rejection F[21] So after going on several first dates for a bit I’ve turned down several people and kinda regularly I’ve had them lowkey or highkey harrase me after I reject them so I started to block immediately after a rejection text even if I had a good time to avoid being said something nasty cause I didn’t want to continue communicating with them. Today I rejected a guy and blocked him (it was a good date just I didn’t feel a connection and I didn’t want to lead him on (which I did say in the text) and blocked after I sent it) about 3 hours later he messages me on my Instagram (that I don’t remember giving him) and he asks me and kinda gives me flack about it too so I gave him a brief reason why. Ik I technically don’t owe him an explanation but still. Do other people do this? I just don’t want something nasty being said to me again and I don’t wanna run the gamble of finding out anymore it sucks when a guy doesn’t respect that I’m not interested,skullital,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d8wtz/i_block_people_after_rejection/,1690681172.0,0.67
Good enough for sex but not s relationship. So I have recently started dating. Went on a few dates with some women that didn't work out. Then I went on my last date with a woman twice and before I could set up a third she said she wasn't interested. I left it at that and moved on. A couple weeks ago by and I get a text that she misses me and still wants to talk but only as friends. I say ok even though I find it to be a bad idea (I find her very attractive and lovely) We hang at my place next to just watch tv and of course end up making out and doing some things. After she leaves she assures me that she doesn't want a relationship and we shouldn't have done that. She then comes back the next night for seven hours and it happens again only this time she cuddles with me and rubs my hand and lays on me afterwards. She even falls asleep on me. Again after she leaves and she says we are just friends and she just likes the attention. I asked her today why she won't see me as more and to be honest but she lies. After more discussion she admits she's not attracted to me like thst. I don't get that because then why does she want to sleep with me. I feel not good enough. It's really messed me up because I actually do enjoy her company and want more than sex. Im not sure if I should cut this off and stop communicating or just stay for now until she finds a bf and enjoy it.  I feel like I'm being used for the first time in my life and its a horrible feeling. I have never in my life been in a situation like this. I basically just need to vent my frustrations and talk about this out loud. Not exactly looking for an answer on what to do. I don't even know anymore.,LittleShowOff11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d0qsl/good_enough_for_sex_but_not_s_relationship/,1690659187.0,0.8
"Am I basically supposed to wait until I'm 26 before I can date? \[Tl;dr: I'm constantly bombarded with the message that unless I make money I'm not worth dating, but I can't start working until I finish studying in late 2025. Am I supposed to wait until then to get a relationship?\]

I (23M) have never been in a relationship. I've recently started doing the work to take more care of myself and to be more socially open. Nevertheless, I'm feeling pretty discouraged, because I feel there just aren't so many opportunities to make connections (I live in a Mediterranean country, where chatting up random people is not socially acceptable the way it is in America). I tried returning to archery as a hobby, hoping it would get me more connections, but everybody is either under 18 or above 30.

But what's been bugging me recently is how I constantly get messages from society and even individual people that basically I am not worth dating until I can make money. (Yeah, you'll now be thinking ""no shit Sherlock, nobody wants to be with a broke ass guy mooching off his parents!"", but bear with me). I graduated mere days ago. The whole process was an ordeal because Covid crushed my mental health like a hydraulic press does glass, so I took 4 years to complete instead of the canonical 3. I have weighed starting to work, but even after applying for some remote jobs to no avail, I realized, together with my therapist, that I'd rather focus on studying as soon as I start my master's degree in September; I calculated that if I started working, I'd be either studying or working at least 50 hours a week, and I'd have only one hour left per day (including sleep, showering, commuting, sports and so forth) which I see as unsustainable. Even my friends that work have said that they'll have to delay their degree due to this, something I really want to avoid this time. In the while, I'm decidedly NOT mooching off my parents - I almost never spend anything on myself except some McDonald's maybe twice a month. Everything else I take is just gifts for my birthday or degree, which I would get anyways. Also, bear in mind that we don't have a cultural expectation to move out of your parents' house as soon as you turn 18 - many people here move out late in their twenties.

So in short, I think I made a sufficient case that I'm not some slob playing videogames all day in his mother's basement, but I'm actively trying to build my life - just not in a way that makes me make money right now.

Where does dating come into play? Well, because as I said, I constantly get the message from society that men are only worth dating if they make money. In no particular order, I've had:

* Countless Tiktoks of women saying that \*not\* splitting the bill on dates is the ""bare minimum"" and that if you aren't making sufficient money to pay for them you shouldn't be dating in the first place;
* A female friend commenting that I ""can afford not working because I don't have a girlfriend, because girlfriends are an additional expense for men"";
* Girls evaluating men in terms of how many flowers, gifts, dinners and so forth they buy for them;
* A guy who commented that it's worse for men to be broke and, upon me inquiring, tacitly admitted that it's because of relationships;
* In general, even outside of conversation about dating, snarky remarks about me having no job yet

If it were just one instance of this happening, I would dismiss it as a shallow person being shallow, but after so many times I \*have\* to start believing they're onto something.

It does break my heart because all I want is to be loved by someone else, and I honestly don't care about ""scoring a 10"" or something. I think my only standards are: loving me, having something interesting to your personality. Even my looks requirements are pretty loose, I think. Even if I didn't make money I'd find a way to make my girlfriend happier, maybe by giving her emotional support, helping her out when she can't do something, validating her, making art for her, taking part in her interests, you name it.

Nobody has said this to me out loud, but I'd be happier if they just told me I have no chance at having a relationship until I have a job. Considering I'll be able to get a stable job only in late 2025 unless I quit studying, that means I'll only have a girlfriend when I'm turning 26.

\*But\* I'm also nervous about waiting until I'm 26, because at that point, it's also possible that women will just think it's a red flag (""what? No woman has wanted him after a whole decade? There must be something wrong with him!"").

"I've noticed my mood depends on guys behaviours. I've been noticing my mood depends on guys lately.

Before all this, I was doing quite good. I didn't had any guys or contact and was quite doing mentally okay.  
I have history of having really up and down periods. I also got some help from professionals with it. Because I got certain 'autism' that makes me feel 'emotions' very intense. Also gained some PTSS because of some really bad experience with an ex boyfriend that was a narcistisc that completely changed my life.

So my mood can be just up and down. Before this it was doing quite good. I distanced myself with guys, didn't have my old life anymore that depended on FWB, going out, and one night stands. And really went better mentally.

Until you meet someone unexpectedly when the first guy came with interest in me in my life. I made myself the promise I only meet up with guys if there a real potential to it, and say that to them also very clearly. So only serious dates. Nothing less.

So the first guy ive met, and also met up with, was quite fun. He told me after that, he wanted to date for real, and see where it goes. Unfortnaly we didn't live very close to each other (4 hour drive) but the contact was fun at first. But ive noticed his way of staying in contact wasn't the way I wanted it, His way of staying in contact online (whatsapp etc) made me trigger my PTSD somehow.

But what I'm noticing, when everything goes well in between us, my mood was so perfect.  
But when there was a slight change (or thinking there was, good in overthinkgin) my mood was downhill.  Like really downhill.  
Even at some point that I couldn't even do my job at that time when is was at the office. My mood really depends on how he was reacting to me.

I was feeling very down again, like almost at the tip of being depressed. Because my mood depended on him and how he was reacting to me.

I had several nights crying but the next day my mood was perfect again because it was okay again.

At some point I made to decision to stop dating this guy because our way of staying in contact wasn't matching for me. It was really hard for me to do that, but I couldn't handle it anymore.

Still noticed myself checking out his location something, because I was afraid that he was already seeing someone for example or Idunno, I just kinda secretly wanted to stay in contact, even I knew that wasn't a good thing to do.

Then I met suddenly someone else. Ive noticed I kinda forgot about the first guy real easy, so that was a relief kinda.

But now, with the new guy, ive notice I get in to deep with my emotions, that I know that if this gonna be fucked up (that it is kinda getting.. im afraid) im really afraid that I well be downhill again mentally.

I don't know what to do. I'm gonna be starting a new job in sept, and I just don't want such thing a distraction anymore..

It's just so not fun that me emotions can be everywhere depending on such things..

"I got broken up with but believe it was self sabotage from my boyfriend. How can I fix this and support him ? Hello everyone,

  
My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. We have been dating for about a year and a half. He is the absolute light of my life : I feel loved, cared for, trusted and safe with him.  
Everything was going well. We met during our studies, but had to spend one year long distance (due to said studies), but managed to meet often. We were planning to get a cat and move in together sometime soon. I am absolutely sure he is right for me, and I have always believed I was right for him too.

  
Lately, he has been very busy, and I think he is burnt out. He said often this last few weeks that he feels low, depressed. I tried supporting him as much as I could. It was hard to see him hurt, but I knew it would get better. His visa is close to an end and he struggles finding a good job to renew it. He might have to move back to his birth country for a while, and I believe this adds on to the stress he is feeling.

  
He decided to break up with me almost out of nowhere. I felt so shocked I couldn't think straight and I didn't manage to say the things I wanted to. Now, I can't eat, I struggle to fall asleep but refuse to wake up because I dream of him, I spend my day holding his old tshirt in my hand. Common friends have mentionned their surprise in this turn of event, and agree with my perception of things. It could be self-sabotaging.  
He told me he loved me so dearly, and that he was leaving me so that I could be happy. I think he believes his depression brings me down, and that I cannot be happy with him. Yet, he made me the happiest and healthiest I have ever been.  
He says he struggles with guilt for ""not being good enough"". I think being rejected from jobs have reinforced his self esteem issues. he also says he needs alone time, which I understand and respect. He usually goes to therapy, but hasn't had time lately.

  
We will be calling again tomorrow, to talk about all this. I am planning on writing a text to help me say all I want to say : having written notes will help me stay calm and control my emotions better.  
About why I am posting this : I need help, I am lost. I never thought this would happen and im very unprepared to deal with it.  
Do you have ideas how to support someone with low self esteem ? How to show someone they are enough ? Ideas to improve communication in a relationship ?

  
Thank you so much for helping me, I wish you all the best.

  
TLDR : my boyfriend have self esteem issues, and feels he is not good enough for me. He is now burn out and broke up with me, probably as self sabotage. Now I need help : tomorrow we are calling, and I want to show him I am there for him and to support him, that he is enough and I love him. How can I support him better ? How can I help with his self esteem ? How can I show him he is enough ? Communication tips ?

"Perception of therapy in early stages I (hetero F) was having a chat with two friends (male and female) and therapy came up in the context of dating... me and my female friend agreed that if a man we're dating shares that he's in therapy, our response to that is 'a green flag'; whereas the male friend said that if a girl tells him she's in therapy, his response would be 'a red flag'.

I recently went on a date with someone I met on Hinge, we both agreed that it was a great time and wanted to see each other again, as we were texting I indirectly mentioned that I was in therapy, in response to 'how was your day?'. Since then, he responded my messages at a significantly slower rate - significant enough for me realise that he chose to 'take his time' and the second date never happened.

I'm not bothered by this as I wasn't super interested and generally speaking would not want to date someone who can't accept that I’m seeing a therapist, I am however wondering if this is a gender thing and applies to the majority of women/men. While I could've been more strategic in how I disclose this, it's not something I would want to omit if I find myself considering to see someone again or on a regular basis.",oystertartare,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d6v7g/perception_of_therapy_in_early_stages/,1690675255.0,1.0

"Is she's a gold digger? Hey, everyone! I (23M) had my very first date with this girl (21F). We met on a dating app and decided to meet the day after. BTW, I'm an introvert, and I was nervous and clueless as I didn't know how dates/meets work.

She asked me to meet her at the nearest metro station to her place at 5 pm. I almost reached on time, but there was a 40-50 minute wait until she arrived. We greeted each other, shook hands, and she started walking me towards a club.

We sat at a table, and she ordered some expensive drinks, such as French fries, a veggie dish, a glass of wine for herself, and a vodka shot for me. It was going well, but then she decided to have two more drinks, while I only had one more. She was a little flirty, asking if I could come over to her place after we finish here. She shared stories about how she lied to her mother to meet me, that she doesn't use Instagram because her brother said not to, and how she knows this place, etc... All her answers somewhat felt like a lie.

After some time, we asked for the bill, but she didn't even suggest that we should split it or something. I had to pay the expensive bill by myself. When we decided to leave, she made an excuse that her sister was going to pick her up, so I couldn't visit her place that day. While leaving the complex, we held hands and talked for a minute or two. She told me to WhatsApp her once I reach my place, so I did.

Now it's day two, and she hasn't even seen the message nor replied to it. I was curious and so checked her dating profile a few times last night to see if she's even online or asleep or something, but she was online, probably talking to other guys or finding new free drinks for herself, I don't know.

I didn't message her since she seems to be a gold digger, or am I wrong? Is this how typical dates go? I could use some advice here.",exist-without-name,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d6asu/is_shes_a_gold_digger/,1690673653.0,1.0
"I think this is evil Hello Lady's and gentelman,

I have a question directed especially for the lady's here.

I have been dating since I was a kid,Pretty intrested in the opposite sex,

Now almost all the girl's that I had I have met face to face  (there was a couple internet exception's..)(I dont have a problem to start chatting with a complete stranger face to face).

I am personally against using social media like facebook,tiktok,Instagram (especially) etc.. (I know that you can play with what you define as 'social media',But I dont include under this definition:dating platform's or website/forum's under this )

So I signed up to this dating site a short time ago,Put my personal info,add a couple of photo's and here we go.

Now I dont like it,since I know that there are situation's that there 200 guys on 1 chick and it can take time till she even see that you have sended her a massage...

I am pretty attractive guy (I try to be attractive from the inside too),I would say very handsome looking + working out seriously (Naturally,for almost a decade).

For this question I put my stat's,

My dry stat's: 1.79cm (should be around 5""10.5),and 96 kilos (around 18% fat for now).

Now,I saw this girl on the dating website,and she posted on her front page:""If you are above 1.80 talk to me"".

Now this thing really pissed me off on the personal level(she is 1.75,I dont say nothing about it for now).

I didnt even chatted with her or something (And of course I wont even chat with her,not beacouse of the height thing,But there is a whole list of requirements down there(dont have tatoos,dont have this long hair blah blah blah),And instead that she will write about herself a little more,about her personality,she is writing what she dont want in the man that will date with her..)I think it is easier to get a computer science/physic's degree than figure out what she want).

Anyway,I imagine,If I was into her,And We have met face to face,And I always try to be very nice or you can call it 'gentelman' especially in the beginning,(Also to understand who is this person in front of me etc),If she is a mentally healthy person,She would never had said ohh you are too short for me (I know that in this case it's 1 cm and she wont care about it anyway,But this is not about me).

Like what if a guy is 1.70 and the girl let's say 1.75?or 1.78?

What you wont date a guy only because of his height?

What if someone shorter so he is not ""good enough""?what is this?

I know that this height thing is mostly BS,And either way woman will be attracted to a guy that know how to talk to her,rather than for technical 'physical stat's'/appearance.

And I personally had girls my height (even that I rarely meet girl's this height or taller),we was in great relationship,and even I was asked by one of them (from her side) to go out on date.

So I want to hear your opinion.

Thanks for your time.

"Dealing with a summer romance Hi everyone, I'm feeling a bit down and would like to hear some opinions/advice from other people.

I got the opportunity to do an internship in Berkeley this summer and thought I'd find myself a summer fling. I was on the apps for maybe a month until this guy pops up and messages me. He's bi and exactly my type. We met up and I told him that this would just be a fling with no strings attached. We hit it off right away and got physical. I had never enjoyed sex before until him. The wonderful thing was that he stuck around, cuddled, kissed me and told me he enjoyed my company. I had never experienced it before and it struck something inside me. I think I started falling for him.

We spent time together almost everyday after that. I have a hard time opening up to men and being vulnerable. And when I've allowed someone so far in, it's hard to let them go. I talked with my friends and I was determined that I would just enjoy my time with him because this would be a great first experience overall. Fast forward to now, we just came back from a road trip we did to Monterey to go hiking in Big Sur. It was the happiest I've ever been in a while. We spent time again last night and he reminded me not to get attached and that I was only temporary Spoingus (a pet name he gave me). The word temporary hit a nerve and I felt sad. I asked him how he would feel when I'm gone and he told me that he'll be sad but he'll be fine. 

I was fully fine about the fate of whatever this was until he called me temporary like I was disposable. It just felt a bit demeaning. He's confused me so much. He acts and treats me the way people would in a relationship yet he tells me to feel differently. Why has he behaved like we were a couple this whole time (pet names, kissing, handholding in public, talking about family, etc)? If a fling was all he wanted, he could've just kept it physical. It's my fault for not setting boundaries and attaching more meaning to it.

Can someone help snap me out of this haze? I'm thinking of ending whatever this situationship is now.

Funny side note: This man fully told me he wanted to marry me and wished I was American (since we're both international students). We even went into a conversation picking out baby names and where we would settle down (decided on Vancouver).",DurianOverlord,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d5pu4/dealing_with_a_summer_romance/,1690672030.0,0.67

"Girlfriend never posts about me. It’s 2023, I mean most people have social media. Especially younger people who grew around technology. I’m not a social media person much, I really use my platforms for clientele for my nail business. But I do acknowledge my girlfriend, and let people I have on social media know I’m in a relationship. My partner constantly posts about dumb crap, conceding weed, vapes, new friend posts, and a whole bunch of other nonsense. She hasn’t posted about me for the past 9 months, usually she would post a picture of me, or post anniversary announcements. When I confront her about it, she just says “oh you have the more of our pictures” or “I don’t post often.” Part of me feels like I’m being hidden and she doesn’t want our relationship being known about anymore. And I’m getting pretty angry, that it’s almost been a year, and I get questions from people she knows about if whether or not we’re still together.

"Talking stage/ dating advice 24F and 25M. He’s in south Fl and I’m in central FL I’m (24F) starting to get back into dating and decided on using hinge. I dating a couple guys in college but some never reached the official bf/gf title stage. Anyways, he’s (25M) and he lives in Miami and is the owner of a family medicine clinic. He told me that’s he’s about to open another location in Aventura and lately he’s been traveling for conferences across the US. 

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting. So far he seems really nice and we vibe. Only thing is the past week I’ve gotten a text like once a day replying and or ❤️ some of my text responses. Maybe I’m just overthinking but is that a 🚩? He might just be busy since he texted me that a couple times but i heard someone else say no man is that busy. Again it’s been a hot minute since I’ve talked/ dated and my previous encounters were in person so Ik online can be different. My sis said that’s not a red flag since I technically hear from him once a day in the talking phase.

Do you think the distance in the potential relationship could work? Orlando to Miami is like a 3 1/2- 4 hour drive or 1 hour flight on the weekend. If all this actually works out I can’t wait to be all over this man. Ngl I’m struggling to not message something crazy but I don’t want to put out the wrong vibes yet and get to know him. Ladies not sure if it’s just me but I feel like once you start to go down that rabbit hole with men it’s hard to turn back lol. I’ll give it 2-3 months time.

"Help me be seen as more I (25f) have come to the realisation that I’m mostly seen as a sex object, maybe more so than the average women (based on discussions with other women) I have been used for sexual reasons before, and I seem to make even the most wholesome or average men turn into horn dogs even in the beginnings of innocent conversations. I’m done with constantly being called sexy and rabidly and pushily lusted after, I want a relationship. My heart was shattered by a man I was in love with who used me for sexual favours and nudes photos, he told me I was the “sexiest, prettiest little thing he’s ever seen” and that “I’d ruined sex with other women because it doesn’t compare” among other cringy things (what bullshit anyway!) but still decided to ditch me for a girl I believe a more “sensible” option. I’m talking to a man now, and although I really like him and I’m attracted to him, from the way he’s began to talking to me, I can see it going down a similar path and him viewing me the same way. What can I do to stop men seeing me as a glorified sex doll? How do I turn this current man’s perception of me around? Serious answers only, I don’t need lecturing. I’m really not that easy and my numbers are well below average because I only do it with men I’m genuinely attracted to and that’s rare that I am genuinely attracted to men.

Sure they can all end bad, yes you can see people for who they are but what is the necessary need to talk crap on their name and even go as far as to make their life hell?

"Dating is so exhausting and confusing I have autism so I have such a hard time getting a read on intent and interest level. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for years so I’m very afraid of getting myself in a relationship like that again.

I met this guy just a couple weeks ago and we’ve seen each other a few times and text every day, he is so sweet and romantic, but he just told me so nonchalantly yesterday that he’s moving a thousand miles away next month. I was surprised and a bit hurt with the way he just so casually mentions it as if it’s no big deal. But I just accepted that ok, he just wants short term fun then, at least the sex is amazing. But then he mentions things like maybe he’ll take me with him. And he tries to tell me that where he’s moving to is a good place for some things that I like, which I say “oh but there’s lots of good options here too”. And he looks disappointed and says that he just wanted to talk me into coming with him.

We barely know each other, we just met two weeks ago, so he can’t be serious. But I don’t get why he’s saying these things to me. Is he just telling me things he thinks I want to hear so I don’t just move on to the next guy and he can still get sex from me for the next 3 weeks while he’s still here?

"I recently left a relationship, met someone new, and I don't feel happy? I never been in a relationship, so when I met her, I thought we were going to get married. I didn't realize that I'd be played with like a toy for 7 years of my life.  
  
For years my gf took advantage of my kindness, my trust, and anything she could find about me. She cheated all these years multiple times over and over and over again. Because I believed I loved her, I'd forgive her thinking she would change. She never changed.  
  
She would cry, say she didn't mean it, say it was a mistake, say she didn't know why she did what she did, and most importantly.. say she wouldn't know what to do with her life without me.. so I would forgive her.  
  
Then she would continue to cheat.  
  
Interestingly, none of these guys wanted to be with her at all. She would always come telling me that they cheated on her and that she is sorry for what she did to me. She knows she is not attractive so she keeps trying with new guys. I know they didn't like her because they always left her for other girls a week later. Most of the time, they would use her and ditch her.  
  
Having a soft spot in my heart for her, seeing her cry and admitting her mistakes, I'd always cave and forgive her. Like clockwork, she'd go back to cheating again, only to be dumped by these guys.  
  
Why did I stay with her? Was it love? Fear of being abandoned? She's all I've know for all these years, even though it was panful.. I don't know. Was it the crying?  
  
After leaving her and to my surprise, I found someone.  
  
Someone amazing, someone smart, someone kind, someone sweet, someone years younger than her. She not only head of heals over me for me, I think I might marry her, and we've only known each other for a month!  
  
I finally feel like I know what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. After 7 years of being cheated on, lied to, emotionally manipulated, having my feelings played with, I finally found someone.  
  
Yet why do I still think about my ex even though she was so horrible to me? Why do I still answer her text and calls? Why can't I block her? Why am I still hopeful in getting back with her?

"Nut sure how to find women I'm on the autistic spectrum and my interactions face to face are always awkward as I seem to have weird mannerisms. 20 years ago (I'm almost 35 now) I managed by meeting girls through forums/chat rooms so that we could develop a certain level of trust over a few months before actually committing to a relationship and seeing each other's faces.

Nowadays, this isn't ideal any more, women are tired of being pestered online and it's more common to rely on apps specifically designed for dates. My problem with this is that I don't really have interesting photos of myself simply because I don't like getting my picture taken and thus got nothing for those kinds of apps. Not only that, my personal style is not something that women nowadays like and thus if the first impression they get is my face, there's a high chance they'll just not be interested.

"Breakup and new girl I am 25 years old. Nine of last ten years i was in relafionships. Three of them were pretty long - 2 years, 2 years and last one was 4 years and i was living with this girl in one apartment for 3.5 years. She broke with me 6 months ago. 

I learned a lot from that and i dont blame her. I was good boyfriend but made some mistakes and got too comfortable at some point. I am sure that we will never be together again, even if she would want to. I dont know if I ever be fully over it - we both stepped in adulthood together, learned a lot of things and had kinda special connection I think. Breakup made me kinda different person, but busides that i party a lot since then it was change for good. It made me trully confident and I am for first time in my life able to fully control my emotions and got my true self back. For whole life I was guy that belevied in true romance and I think for now I kinda lost that and I am more realistic. It hurts to accept new reality, but I am fine with that. I think i got my shit together as a man and I am on right life path.


For the past months I flirted with a lot of girls, slept with 4 ones. I am pretty attractive men and never had problems with girls. But lastly I got to conclusion that pursuing with girls that i know I dont want to be with in long term relationship is pointless as I quickly lose interest in them. I got big thing for high inteligence in girl and I care about that even more than looks - some girls that were unatractive for me from start and then i noticed their Intelligence turned to be hot as fuck for me. 

Two months ago i met a girl that is in unhappy relationship, this is her first guy and she is with him for 4 years but from what I noticed she is scared to leave him, she is 22 years old. From the start we both clicked very hard and I rarely view girls as relationship meterial. It never got physical and month ago we decided to take a break from each other. I think she is still in relationship with this guy - she is kinda scared of me beacause i gave her player vibes as there were a lot of women around me when we met. I know this is red flag, but my intuition which rarely lets me down tells me to take that risk.

As I stated before party a lot recently and I know I wont stop untill i will have someone that i will truly want to take care of. Constant partying is not in line with my fitness and life goals, but there is really no way for me to stop it when I am single, i really know that part of myself. I think in next weeks I will decide to contact her again. I dont think if it works it will be rebound relafionship but I am not sure as I stated before my whole life I was jumping from relationship to relationship.

"Men, I'd like to hear your opinion My name is Kira, and this is the story of how my life took an unexpected turn. I've always been a slim girl, and it was something I never paid much attention to until I met Alex. He was charming, and we quickly fell in love, seemingly perfect for each other. Little did I know that my body would become a source of heartache in our relationship.  
At first, Alex never mentioned anything about my weight. We were happy, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. But as time went on, I started to notice him acting distant. He would make subtle comments about my appearance, hinting that I should gain weight. I brushed it off initially, thinking he was just concerned about my health.  
One evening, as we were sitting in a park, the sun setting behind us, Alex finally gathered the courage to talk about what was bothering him. His words struck me like a dagger to the heart.  
""Kira, I've been thinking a lot lately,"" he began hesitantly. ""I care about you, but I can't help feeling like you're just too skinny. It's hard for me to see us having a future together like this.""  
Tears welled up in my eyes, and I tried to hold back the pain that was bubbling inside me. I couldn't believe that my body, something I had no control over, could be a reason for someone to break my heart.  
""You mean you're breaking up with me because I'm too skinny?"" I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion.  
""I just don't think we're compatible in that aspect,"" he replied, his voice gentle but unwavering.  
Feeling a mix of anger and sadness, I stood up, looking at him with a newfound determination. ""You know what, Alex? I refuse to let anyone dictate how I should look or feel about my body. If you can't accept me for who I am, then maybe it's best we go our separate ways.""  
And with that, I walked away, leaving Alex behind with his shallow beliefs. In the days that followed, I struggled to come to terms with the end of our relationship. But gradually, I began to find my strength again.  
I surrounded myself with supportive friends and family who reminded me that I was perfect just the way I was. I focused on my passions, my dreams, and found joy in activities that made me happy. Most importantly, I learned to love myself, flaws and all.  
As time passed, I realized that Alex's rejection had been a blessing in disguise. It had taught me to value myself and to never compromise my self-worth for anyone else's approval. I began to see my body as a symbol of resilience and strength, not a flaw to be fixed.  
And as fate would have it, in the most unexpected moment, I met someone new. A person who embraced me for who I was, who saw beauty in my uniqueness, and cherished me without trying to change me.  
Looking back, I am grateful for the pain I endured because it led me to a greater understanding of myself. I am no longer defined by someone else's standards of beauty. I am Kira, a strong and confident woman, loving myself just the way I am. And that is a love that no one can take away from me.",KiraRai69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d1ctj/men_id_like_to_hear_your_opinion/,1690660777.0,0.6
"Advice moving forward. Hello,

So I am thinking about deleting Tinder and Hinge. It does not seem to be going anywhere. Unfortunately, the men on these apps (from the 30+ I have gone out with at least) don't have much depth to them, just want sex, are super shy, lie, or have massive egos. I am just saying this about the guys I have gone out with on these apps not men in general. 

I like to talk about intellectual topics (science, history, philosophy etc.), but I can not seem to find guys that are intellectual on these apps despite the fact that many claim to be intellectual.

I still want to date, however I attend a really small university that has a 7 girls to one guy ratio. Most of the guys are taken which is fine and I am happy for them.

I am premed and I try to do premed internships. However, there are very few men in these internships. The majority of which are taken. 

My hometown has a population of about 3,700 people so not much luck here unfortunately.

What should I do? Thanks for your input.",bored_suitcase,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d0y9l/advice_moving_forward/,1690659721.0,1.0

"Not sure what to do I (M33) have been dating my girlfriend (F25) for a little over 6 months. Background: we’ve met each others family’s and had all the future plan talks. Just moved in together.

She tends to go out every weekend with her girlfriends which I don’t mind most of the time. However, last night was odd.

I’ll also preface this by saying we used to share locations with each when going out early on and then we just left it on.  

So she went out with her friend (F24) for some guys bday that they both knew. I had met him one time as well, super cool gay guy. 

We normally communicate with each other throughout the night via text. Around 12am was the last text she responded to, I noticed around that time her location changed to a couple miles down the road. Didn’t think anything of it until she didn’t respond to me until like 2:20am. Around that time her location showed her somewhere else in an apartment complex.

She gets home, gets in bed and tries to go to sleep right away no kiss or hug or even look at me. I saw that as odd. I said hey I missed you, come here. And she rolled over. I asked how was the that guys party? You were there pretty long (she doesn’t tend to stay out at a house party that long). 

She responded saying it was it was a chill vibe but musty but didn’t say anything about going anywhere else. I asked where her friend was bc normally she’ll sleep over if they go out and her stuff was here. She said she went somewhere with some guys and wanted her to come but she wanted to come home. Another note: my girl was super drunk

All these things don’t add up to me and then while she’s sleeping her phone goes off several times. I couldn’t resist the urge to check. Some guy in her contacts named “Voice” has a few messages showing. I check her phone and it’s a guy basically texting her wanting to fuck. The message thread goes back to last Sunday, where he says what are you up to queen, I want to take you out on a date to which she replies omfg I can’t stand you hahah 

Then yesterday night he sends her $100 via apple pay and says he wants to eat her out from behind. She responds saying Dam he ain’t playing, and this was while we were watching that new who cloned Tyrone movie on Netflix.

He sends her like 7-8 more messages throughout the day to early this am basically telling her he wants to fuck her. She hasn’t responded. I also noticed she payed some guy Dom 10 bucks via Apple Cash last night. 

Sorry for the long read, but I felt context was necessary. I’m going on a trip to Europe tomorrow with her and I don’t know what do. Should I be tripping? And do I confront her? Advice needed

TLDR: girlfriend lied about where she was last night, acted “off”. Engaged in messaging some guy who wants to fuck her. Not sure what to do",TheSauceofMike,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cv67a/not_sure_what_to_do/,1690644821.0,1.0

My first love - pregnant
Second girlfriend, pregnant and married
Third girlfriend, has a kid and married
Fourth girlfriend, two kids and married
Fifth girlfriend, dating the same girl for three years (her and I lasted four months)
Sixth girlfriend, married
Last girlfriend, happy in her new relationship of one year

"Shower thought: I'm finally old enough to date the men I actually want This is my secret controversial opinion lol. Getting to my mid-20s has finally allowed me to date late 20s-early 30s guys. My partner now is in that age range and I absolutely love it. I've always been annoyed by the lack of maturity of the younger guys who surrounded me. I've secretly liked older guys the most for many years now but, obviously, I couldn't date them before. And they wouldn't date me, either. But now I have finally found the mature, stable, sexy (silver foxes rule ;) ) partner I've always dreamt of. And he likes me back!! Life is nice.

Edit: wow, seems like my opinion really is controversial haha. Some of you commented that age does not equal maturity and I agree with that. However, there really is a huge difference between a 20 yo and a 30 yo. Surely, we can agree on that? As for why I couldn't date them before - unbalanced power dynamics give me the ick. As a 20 yo, I had no business dating men 10 years my senior. I was a naïve a child by comparison and I knew that, so I purposely didn't pursue them.

Over the phone and texting wise I like him. But in person I’m just not as confident in my feelings as I was before. And I feel like this is a pattern I have. He told me he really liked me and that he could see us going somewhere in the future. At first I thought this too but I don’t know if I’m self sabotaging and overthinking everything or if I truly just don’t vibe with him. Im so very confused and frustrated that every time I get close to maybe wanting to date date someone I always seem to second guess and back out. I also have this tendency to complain in my head about that person once we’ve went on a date. I focus on all the things I don’t like.

Still living with parents because the town I live in is small and we barely have apartments here etc. I'm struggling with looking for someone. I've always been rejected because of my disability. I feel like no woman wants me etc. I've been psychologically emotionally manipulated in High School which gave me severe PTSD because I got bullied and got rejected. 100% true story. Dealing with trauma. Just asked a girl out. Trying to face my fear. She rejected me but she was nice. Think I've handled it well. I also have an over protective mom. Love her to death but she refuses to let me date. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe she thinks me getting rejected again will trigger my PTSD? Any advice guys? My trauma was so bad the girl in question accused me of stalking. Lowered my self esteem so bad I felt like I didn't belong in the school etc. Now I'm having recurring nightmares etc. Let's say she was a narcissist at its finest. Currently going to therapy. EDIT: I always seem to attract TOXIC women. I don't know why??? Even tho I'm a nice guy. It sucks really.

What should I do I need to date someone eventually. I just don't want my mom telling me not to date is all. She keeps saying I have allot of growing up to do on top of that I need a job and need to get my license. Reason I don't have my license is we moved allot. And I have a fear of driving and dying in an accident that I'm trying to get over. I know all the answer for the written test. Just I don't know allot of my friends keep telling me I'm better off being single because I'll have more money and I'll be more happy. But being single is just making me miserable to be honest. I get told I'm a likeable and lovable guy. And I make allot of people laugh and I make girls laugh too. I've been catching girls checking me out lately but I'm too afraid to make a move on them etc I don't like cheesey pick up lines etc. I want to get to know them FIRST and take shit slowly etc. I dont want to rush a relationship if that makes sense.

I managed to calm her down by assuring her that I will be with her till the end and there is no pressure of marriage, im there regardless. 

For the next 2 weeks our conversations were dry, although I got responses to ""I love you"" and such, things have now gone confusing. She would message first, the conversations are not so dry anymore, they are improving gradually but romance is non existence. Just last time around I would say ""i love you"" and she replied with an ""ilyt"". The next day she would go on message first. Yesterday she didnt reply back with the usual heart emojis, but again messaged first.

"UPDATE: I (24F) feel unsure about the relationship I've been in with 31M Hi everyone. My post didn't gain much traction, but I do want to thank those that took the time to comment. I did read everyone's comments, but I didn't respond. Here's the update:

&amp;#x200B;

He decided taking a break was silly, so he decided he wanted to try again, which I agreed to with the boundary that if he emotionally whiplashes me again, I will be leaving. Honestly, though, I didn't feel much of an urge to go spend time with him or be with him. This week I had a psychiatry appointment and a therapy appointment in which I started to talk to my therapist about how I often find myself in unhealthy relationships with men. One of the things that we talked about is knowing my value and setting boundaries and expectations of how I should be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today he and I decided to try to hang out. Part of me was actually really excited. I missed him. He told me he was missing his girl as well. We started to call, and the topics just felt kinda strange. He was immediately asking me about therapy and what my therapist thinks about how we mesh, or what types of things don't mesh well for us. I felt a little uncomfortable because I feel like what I speak about in therapy is really up to me whether I want to disclose, and despite me saying that the therapy appointment wasn't specifically about him or anything he still pushed for answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to screenshare myself playing a game and I got slightly frustrated and made a couple comments that a particular combination of powers in this game was kinda annoying to deal with. He then asked me if I'm frustrated why am I playing it. I said I'm not that frustrated and I'm having fun. He's made comments in the past about the games I play, that I shouldn't play games that frustrate me, etc. And it's like... Idk I would think he would understand because he himself plays games, but there's times where a game might be slightly annoying but you still enjoy it, right? But anyway, he ended up hanging up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to discuss what happened with him, that I don't like when he makes comments about the games I play and when I should and shouldn't play them. He then guilt tripped me, saying ""I guess I'm just a piece of shit then"" and ""well excuse me for caring about you"" and finally blew a fuse, telling me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I finally have had enough of his emotional instability and immaturity. I don't believe I deserve to be spoken to in that way or treated the way he has treated me. Just prior to me sharing my screen, he had told me that nobody he's ever been in a relationship with has ever been as good at ""conflict resolution"" as I have with him. But then he does this. He's just so volatile, and it's either everything is great or everything is awful with him. I have members of my family that have bpd, and I realized the way he acts sorta these two extremes feels kinda similar to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And regarding him pressuring me for sex, I'm really glad I didn't give in. He hasn't really made me feel cared about in quite some time despite it being such a short relationship. I'm not sure what his intentions were with me, but I don't think I'll ever find out. I've now blocked him and I'm ready for a chapter of peace and healing now. I will be working together with my therapist to get to a healthier spot with myself before pursuing another relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess kinda a sad update but probably not one that was unexpected. Thank you to those who took the time to read and respond. I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I broke up with my emotionally labile 31M bf of about a month after he blew a fuse at me especially with his history of emotionally whiplashing me and pressuring me for sex.

Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I’ve recently started talking to this girl, she’s 28, I’m 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we’re probably more friends than anything else.
We’ve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn’t help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I’m shy and I can’t really find anything to talk about that we’d have in common. She’s a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can’t be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it’ll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it’s because she didn’t talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cpdqx/need_advice_social_skills/,1690628051.0,1.0
"Help! When to break up TL;DR I've been seeing a guy for a few months (only about once or twice a week, though, so it still feels pretty new). However, I'm now pretty convinced it won't work out long term and I need to end things sooner rather than later, but the timing is horrid and I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and deal with the messy fall out or let things drag out for a month and then end it when there won't be as many complications.  
A few months ago, I met a guy at a mutual friends birthday party (she was hoping we'd hit it off, so it was a bit of a set-up). And, it was fun and exciting at first, but then we kissed and I instantly lost all feelings of attraction when he initiated a French kiss. For context, I've never kissed anyone before nor been in a serious relationship (which he knows). So, I don't know if I just don't like French kissing or if it's related to him.  
A few days after the kiss, I managed to stop thinking back on it with negative thoughts and get my feelings to mostly neutral, but I can't get the attraction back. We kept meeting up, although only about once per week (we were both doing a lot of traveling and I wasn't really pushing to meet up more, although I think he would have liked to). I really enjoy spending time with him and we go out and have fun together, but my sexual attraction towards him seems to be stuck at neutral.  
He's been really nice and is very clear that we should go at my pace, and I was planning on going all the way with him at some point (I need to get some medical stuff done, so I can't right now anyways). But, I'm realizing now that might be worse to have sex when I'm not really feeling it and then break up shortly afterwards? I felt like I owed him something for being so patient (no pressure from him), but now I realize it's maybe more likely he'd feel used?  
The other night, we had a heavy make-out session (all but PIV). And, it was nice but honestly not more than that. And, he seems to be getting more interested and wanting to spend all our time together while I'm just as happy on my own. The last few times we've met up, I've tried to be more careful about not giving him a compliment back just because he gave me one and only saying things if I really mean them, which has definitely led to me receiving more compliments than I'm giving, but I don't know if he'll pick up on that as a clue that I'm not feeling things and drifting away or still be completely blindsided.  
The major problem I have now is when to do it. We'll have to see each other at least a couple times in the next few weeks as we're working on a project together. The only way to avoid that would be if I almost completely cut contact with a lot of my friends for a month since he's more integral to the project than I am (they know we're dating, though, so I think they would understand me wanting to give him space, but I still think it would make our friendship suffer). Additionally, my birthday is coming up in a few weeks and we just started talking about plans for it. I would have really loved to invite everyone over (his friends and mine) and have a party. But, I don't want to drag this out and feel like either now before we actually plan anything for my birthday is the best time or after the project and my birthday have passed. I fear no matter what I do, he's going to feel blindsided and heartbroken. And, I genuinely would really want to stay friends (especially since our friends groups overlap), but he seems to have really strong feelings towards me, so I'm worried that won't work out.  
Is there a way I could gradually end things over a month that would be less painful?  
And, should I go with my plan of saying I really like him as a person and friend, but my sexual attraction towards him just isn't there and he deserves someone to love all of him? Or will that just open the door to bargaining?

"Confused!!! Would a guy text you all day everyday if he wasn’t interested?
 
I met this guy in February and he pursued me.he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship right now just chillin. I gave him my number a month later and I consider him a friend. Now I like him and he says he doesn’t like me back but why continue to text me everyday all day even when we’re at work. For example, We would text from like 7:30 am to one of us falls asleep at night and continue that conversation back up the next morning until night and so on. I had sex with him recently I’m 28 years old and he’s 38. He’s my first kiss, and sex partner. And he knew that before anything happened. He also married with a child. I looked him up on fb and was shocked but they’re separated. He still hasn’t confessed to me yet that he’s married and he doesn’t know I know. He also lives with his mom.

"What does the saying "" I don't date for 1 year or 3 years, I date for life, I date to get married "" even means ? I've heard this saying "" I don't date for 1 year or 3 years, I date for life, I date to get married "" a few times. And I've trouble understanding.

I mean as long as you're not looking for something casual, or that you're not for example in a place just for a few months and are looking for a casual partner just for the time you're there etc. you're automatically dating "" for life "" right ?

If a relationship lasts 1 year - 3 years, it's just because it didn't work out, I'm not sure anyone is looking to date for 3 years and stop.

Long story short we both worked together and we fell for each other, but she had a boyfriend. My dumbass asked her out anyways because I thought she left him because of how much she was into me. She even said she “loved” me multiple times, and was crying once I left that job. It’s like we were soulmates, just stuck in bad timing. Anyways, I haven’t talked to her since then, even though I was crying for months. And wishing we can still talk, but I know my pride wouldn’t let me do that. So I left without a word. Anyways, I studied and got myself a great career afterwards, and after two years. I saw her again today at my job as a new employee. All a suddenly, a whole bunch of emotions that came from seeing her rushed through me. At first I hoped she wouldn’t talked to me at all. And she didn’t. I don’t even know if she recognized me because I have facial hair now, and it’s been two years. Anyways, I couldn’t focus at work because I was just sad. And at one point crying again (like right now). We both made eye contact, but I didn’t know what to do. She knew I was going into this career before I stopped talking to her, but I don’t know if she’s here because of me, or her friend (apparently her friend works in the same field as me), or just the money.

"I (M21) getting confusing signals from my friend (F21) I have this female friend situation i really need some advice here

For context im in my early twenties so is she. Ive known her for about 2 years now and have been friends since. We met over a mutual friend. And I notice that Im starting to fall in love with her. The problem is… she really confuses me

When I ask her do do something she says yes when she has time and seems exited to see me shes very touchy and cuddles with me when were on a couch or something. She takes random pictures of me and even had me as her lockscreen on her phone. But shes not a big texter and very rarely asks me out back. 

The way shes physical with me feels like shes trying to make me make a move.  For example we where lying on my bed and shes hugging me and lying on top of me for a little bit but as i do nothing she stops hugging me again, slaps my but jokingly or starts playfights. 

The problem is that she says she doesnt like men and relationships or intimacy that way. She even had a girlfriend before.

Im not making any moves because she told me that but i feel like she also gives different signals. Im also pretty insecure and scared about relationships since ive never been intimate with a girl before. And have been hurt badly before. 

What im i suposed to do im noticing im falling in love and i dont know what to do i cant read the situation properly but i also dont want to loose her as a friend. And i dont want my heart broken again:(

"Relationship problems Me (21F) have been in a relationship with my partner (21M) for almost a year now. We are very different in many ways, he is more extroverted and I am very introverted. I would say overall that our relationship has been pretty good. 

However I can't help but worry that we might be too different, he is of more conservative values and I'm more open minded with how you dress, what you do and stuff... generelly. So sometimes I feel like the things I want to do in life is without his support nor understanding. And lately the things he's saying and doing really upsets me. 

First of all he is white and uses the n-word a lot especially when we are with his family. I don't think he means it in a harmful way towards black people but still I cringe every time he says it, cause I feel like it is wrong for us to use it and especially so casually. I just don't know how to bring it up when we're alone and how to confront about it without calling him racist. 

Another thing is how he has been with other girls when we are out and drinking. He is always touching some other girl (on the back or shoulders) and to me it just seems unnecessary. Like I understand that he is more social and likes to interact with people and be friendly, but the touching really makes me uncomfortable. I would only touch a guy like that if I was flirting and that is what I feel like he is doing.. flirting.. This is something I did mention to him one night when he was being extra flirty with a girl and I just had enough of it cause I felt like it was embarrassing for me as his partner to sit while he was constantly fishing for another girl's attention.

 He has promised to not act like that again and says that since I'm his first partner he doesn't know where the boundaries are at. But I really can't seem to let it go this time, it's like I don't trust him the way I used to do. 

Our sex life is also getting worse, cause lately I just don't have the desire for it. I'm still attracted to him but I just can't relax when we have sex. I'm also lying about getting orgasms cause he always ask about it and wants me to say when I get one, so I'm stressed about trying to orgasm instead of just being natural and just being in the moment... 

I know that we're over the honeymoon fase and sometimes we will disagree on things, but I shouldn't go around being annoyed and frustrated and worry about how he interact around other girls.

"How do I give green light to be approached (according to the western expectations)? I (20F) come from a more conservative country and am used to guys being aggressive and insistent in their approach to dating and girls dressing nice, taking care of their appearance and waiting to be chosen. Therefore I still struggle to adapt to the western dating style. 

I've been told by my friends that guys rarely approach me because I don't signal to them in any way that I want to be approached. Now, first of all, that presents a logical fallacy: if I signal interest to a guy and he takes the bait, doesn't that mean he approaches me because he thinks I am interested in him and therefore am an easy target rather than HIM BEING INTERESTED IN ME? I mean, I would want a guy to approach me bc he thinks I'm beautiful, not because my interest strokes his ego. That's just humiliating for a woman. 

Second of all, how do I do that, like technically. I'm not talking about randos on the street; but, apparently, here, acquaintances, guys from the same college etc. when they engage with you at a party or in any other social gathering they expect YOU to indicate an interest in them before making their intentions clear. Then a) when a guy starts talking to me how tf do I differentiate between a guy who is gauging my interest and a guy who is just making conversation in a friendly way? And b) how can I signal to a guy I am available to be pursued without sounding too eager and making a fool out of myself?

He doesn’t ask to see me and when I ask to see him, he’s always busy. i’ve been distant for about a few days now and he got upset that I’ve been distant but he has no idea that I’m just doing what he’s doing. he said that our conversations are repetitive and and he feels that it just fizzled out. he never communicated that to me until now and he ended our talking stage. he also told me that I was being too sexual all the time which is definitely not true. he would tell me that all I want to do to him is kiss him (i mean….of course i’m going to say that. like i like you hello??) and I’ve never met a man that doesn’t like attention like that. He also never seemed to mind when i would tell him things like that and it’s odd to me that all of a sudden it’s a problem and it HAS been a problem. I’m never the type of person to be over sexual like that and I told him that it might be coming off that way because men only want one thing and that’s the only way to keep men interested. He got really offended that I categorized him as “all men.” He doesn’t understand that when a man backs away and is distant, we as women think that we need to spice it up a bit. but personally, I think that him getting bored after two weeks is not reasonable.

But basically I live in Los Angeles and I’m a regular at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood that I work remotely at 2-3 times a week. There is a guy that in the past six months, I’ve probably seen approximately 4 to 5 times also at this coffee shop. He also happens to be in one of my favorite bands (fairly big boy band). I’ve always thought he was super cute, but never bothered him at the coffee shop since he was usually just popping in and out and I was there working on my computer. Last weekend I went out to a club with a couple friends, and he was there. He approached me, and we were talking and flirting and really hit it off. My friends wanted to go to a different club so we exchanged numbers and have been texting ever since. He didn’t recognize me from the coffee shop and I never mentioned having seen him there a bunch cuz it felt creepy? I also never brought up the fact that I knew who he was already because I didn’t want to come off as that was the only reason I was talking to him. But now I realize it might actually be creepier of me to not have mentioned it, considering I definitely know who he is and have seen him in public multiple times. I feel like I messed up by not coming clean initially I was just nervous it was going to come off stalker-ish even though it’s literally been a huge coincidence. How do I bring it up now and not have it be weird or is it too late and I kinda ruined it? 

I would love to keep talking to him as we actually do get along really well and seem to have a lot in common and have been enjoying talking to each other the past week. He’s mentioned meeting up again this weekend but I’ve put it off since I don’t really know how to move forward.

I’m not sure what’s going on bc I never asked them about exes and it makes me feel like shit when they randomly bring them up this early.. I mean like the first date or prior when we chat online. I never even had a freaking ex or relationship. Nobody asked me on dates in real life or school or uni in the past. And these guys are in their 30s, say they’re looking for serious, well educated and seemed like nice guys at first? They are well educated with good jobs and degrees but don’t know that it’s disrespectful to talk about exes randomly so early on?pst of them don’t ask about my past either. I’m not sure what’s going on that I keep getting the same thing from diff apps. And I’d expect to go on fun, happy summer dated but this happens. It’s a whole turn off and mood ruined for me when they mention exes(ex.. oh you think you can be friends with exes- one guy asked, another one mentioned his ex used to like this one place on our date at a restaurant, another guy spoke about a professor from by league canceling their date last minute and his ex was a professor too ? 🤦‍♀️ ). I thought it’s  a sign for me to not date now or use dating apps? Or my energy is attracting these types of guys? I just don’t get it but I end up feeling like shit and not good enough and like those exes are better than me. It  reminds me of the past when I was in school or uni and really liked some guys(not popular ones but normal.. sometimes a bit nerdy) but they always liked some other girl.

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that? I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

"Narc ex (21M) begged me (21M) for another chance but then left me to be friends with benefits with someone else, what? Two weeks ago I left my narc ex because he was a horrible human being, I’ll make a short list  
\- Slept with someone else the same day we broke up (multiple times)  
\- Made out with a 14 year old (he is 20)  
\- He supports school sh\*\*ters and terr\*rism  
\- Mysoginist and red p\*ll  
\- Objectifies people for sex  
\- Anger issues  
\- Wanted to k\*ll his ex girlfriend  
\- Cheated on me once a week (not always physical)  
\- Tired to break up with me once a week (we always talk it out)  
\- Everytime he tries to break up with me, he talks to other 10 people  
\- Slept with pr\*stit\*tes   
\- Emotionally and verbally abused me  
\- Stingy as hell  
\- Will leave you at the side of the road at night if you make him angry  
\- knew I was a virgin and was willing to wait but when e realized he had to get tested before we get intimate he changed his mind (he still did it in the end with a lot of convincing)  
\- Said he was willing to wait for me to be ready but kept pressuring me through break ups  
\- I always planned the dates  
\- Etc  
So basically I break up with him and block him permanently, a week later he manages to contact me begging me for another chance, telling me he was depressed and was willing to put in the work, this had never happened so I believed him, fast forward to two days later, he says he changed his mind because someone else who is “sl\*ttier” than me, wanted to be friends with benefits with him….   
I’m the only second person in his life he was/wanted to be in a relationship with and he knows he’ll never find someone like me (that I have special) , but he chose to have sex with someone else instead of waiting for me, I gave him so much unconditional love but he chose to be selfish.  
I try to talk it out because I know he is disordered and impulsive, he manages to have a moment of clarity and agrees to get back with me but then he loses it and starts cussing me out telling me to leave him alone and he isn’t sure what he wants, I block him.  
How should I see all this? I am not jealous of the new guy because my ex told me himself I am better, he just chose him because of sex, but it still bothers me, how could he choose something so frivolous over genuine connection? And if I had given him my virginity, would he still be with me?",pixelthoughtz,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cr9q5/narc_ex_21m_begged_me_21m_for_another_chance_but/,1690634150.0,1.0

"Ghosting I (25 yr old male) got ghosted and I don't fully understand why.

We met on one of the popular dating apps. After we had a couple facetime sessions that went well, we decided to schedule an in person date at her apartment. We agreed that I would bring wine and my video game system and we would play video games and build a Lego set (probably a big mistake on my part), although she did have work the next day.

After driving down to her apartment to meet her, I immediately began to set up the game system, chatted with her a little, and eventually after a little struggle with set up, we finally started playing. We drank some wine, played some video games, and talked. We were struggling to keep a extend conversation due to the amount of things going on, and I decided to flirt with her a little and I kissed her. This was probably my biggest mistake as it was very quick and awkward. I did it because I wanted to show that I was still romantically interested. Looking back though, it was probably creepy and probably what really killed the vibe, along with the dying conversation.

I then proceeded to stay on her couch a little bit longer while I sobered up to drive home and eventually said my good byes, and left.  She did text me after I got back home to see if I was ok but it's been radio silent ever since.

This isn't the first date I've been ghosted (3rd)  at so I'm starting think the problem is me. What can I do to at least not be a weirdo and maybe get a second date, or even a response. I'm about to give up dating since I just don't understand it and hate putting myself through endless suffering for no reason.",sushimonster13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cqmbf/ghosting/,1690632125.0,0.99
"Which dating apps are not owned by Match Group? I know that Tinder, Hinge and Plenty of Fish are owned by Match Group.

Anyone know anything about the others? Apparently Bumble was started by a female ex-Tinder employee who wanted to make dating apps safer for women. Probably explains why I'm banned from that one 🙈💀. But who owns it now? I heard a rumour it was owned by the same people as Badoo.

I guess Facebook Dating is about the only dating app that isn't owned by money-making scumbags (Facebook owner has already made his money).",kikokukake,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cqhfb/which_dating_apps_are_not_owned_by_match_group/,1690631715.0,0.33
