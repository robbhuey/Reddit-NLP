"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

"Really ashamed of myself‚Ä¶ guy I am seeing acted strangely when I fainted. Please advise on what I should do. ** UPDATE **

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm so grateful for all of your advice and I think it‚Äôs been really helpful in having me dodge a major bullet here. Thank you so much üíóüíóüíó

The guy messaged me back and he didn‚Äôt ask remotely how I was, just talked about himself. So, I told him as politely as I could that I wasn‚Äôt interested in seeing him again because compassion is  a trait I really need in all of my partners, both casual and committed. He made no attempt to explain himself. 

I‚Äôm discharged down now and I‚Äôm relatively well, have lost a fair bit of blood but I‚Äôll be okay and I‚Äôm getting a whole load of tests over the next week and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get to the bottom of this. 

I‚Äôm deleting these dating apps because I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre good for me at all. 

With best wishes and hugs to you all


** ORIGINAL POST **



I need a little clarity on how I should be feeling and act in this situation. 

TL;DR: I fainted after losing a lot of blood during sex. The guy reacted weirdly and is ignoring me. What should I do?

I (21F) had been seeing this guy (24M) for a few weeks and I decided last night to be intimate with him, completely consensually. 

It was all great at that point and it was really fun; afterwards we cuddled and he did talk about the future/ seeing me again. 

However, in the morning when we had sex, we were a bit too rough and I think I tore something internally a little. I bled bright blood (not my period - this was different) everywhere and he was horrified. 

I apologised profusely and got up to clean myself up in the bathroom, but fainted, covered in blood, on his floor. 

We acted like it was really normal after - I stayed on the floor a while, got up, ate what I felt like I could (though I physically felt really sick and had ringing in my ears still) and I washed his ruined sheets for him. 

He looked so freaked the entire time, if not disgusted by the blood, and more or less refused to acknowledge it. 

He drove me home but said he ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt sure‚Äô if he wanted to see me again as he was now too busy. 

I fainted when I walked in my flat, and ended up having to go to the emergency room as I did not stop bleeding for a number of hours after. I lost about a pint of blood in all (it‚Äôs under investigation). 

The guy messaged to thank me for the night, and I replied saying the same and asking how he was, but he has not replied in hours and had left me on read. 

I‚Äôm heartbroken and so ashamed that I messed up his sheets, and that as a result of the episode it seems like he wants nothing to do with me now. 

I also think he acted really strangely about it, what do you think about this whole situation?",anonacc1754,208,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cwazp/really_ashamed_of_myself_guy_i_am_seeing_acted/,1690647734.0,0.93
"Do women really think that all they need to do for sex is just show up?

As beautiful as she was I could not keep my erection. She made bo attempts to excite me or have any need for foreplay. She questioned what was wrong with me?  So I told her.  To which she replied what else did I need?  I replied just like I enjoyed kissing and licking every part of her beautiful body I too could benefit from receiving it.

"How do I take back saying ‚ÄòI just wanna be friends‚Äô to a guy? I (24F) recently told a guy (24M) I've been seeing that I'd like to just be friends, and now l'm interested in being more than that.

I originally told him that based on some advice from my friends-but I've realized (late of course) that my opinion is the most important and that I actually do want to have some sort of physical relationship with this guy.

I turned him down about a week ago and he was very understanding and kind, but it's obvious he's switched to friends only mode. We don't talk as much and I saw that he's already updated his dating profile a bit. Which is ofc, totally normal considering that's what would be expected given what I said.

Is it even possible to remedy this?

"I(22m) have been seeing This girl(19f)for a few weeks now. I think she wants me to be her boyfriend. She's a virgin and 'desperately' wants to have sex, but I'm conflicted. 

We have been going on dates (5 in total) since last the last week of june. I think so far so good in terms of the time we've spent together overall. 

But last Saturday. I showed her my apartment for the first time. We shared a few bottles of wine. I played my guitar riff for her. All seemed normal. 

Then she asks if I want to have sex with her. Like just like that. Quite randomly and brazenly. She seemed a bit drunk so I laughed nervously. Obviously she told me she was a virgin in one of the early dates so It kinda shocked me how casually she was talking about sex given she's a virgin. Also I didn't want to sleep with someone who was very likey drunk too. Doesn't seem right.

So I  just keep playing my guitar and she starts semi taking her dress on and off. Danceing with a combustion of laughter. Honestly it felt so uncomfortable. You laugh yourself to hide the awkmoment. 

She then starts cuddleing me on the sofa I was sat on(with my guitarüé∏). She then shortly falls asleep on my left shoulder. 

I then decide to go to sleep. Except I decide to pick her up. Put her in my bed while I sleep on the sofa. Out of respect I suppose. 

We then wake up we talk for a while about random things going on in the world. I tell her how funny was she was last night and she just laughs and before she leaves tells me 'we need to hangout more' and I should 'come to hers and meet her parents' I tell her I'd be open to that. 

Then literally just before she leaves my apartment door.  She says jokingly or in jest says 'her bed is big enough for us to fuck'. 

I'm just so so headfucked by her. Does this mean she sees me as a boyfriend by how she acting and talking(about seeing her parents)? I've never knew a girl like this. 

And is OK for Me to have sex with her given she doesn't seem the most mentally stable at times. I wouldn't want to hurt her little sweet soul in any way.",Formal-Crab-181,514,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c5hjc/i22m_have_been_seeing_this_girl19ffor_a_few_weeks/,1690569569.0,0.9

I think it caught him proper off guard as he wasn't expecting it - so just wanted to ask what is the best way to navigate this kind of situation if they can't give their number at work, but you find them attractive?

"Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place? I‚Äôm confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don‚Äôt do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I‚Äôve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I‚Äôm confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Is she really just looking for a place to stay and this is something friends do? Is there a chance something romantic could happen when she visits?",jbsIV,219,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c85r4/why_would_a_girl_that_rejected_me_ask_to_stay_at/,1690575877.0,0.93

"I've noticed my mood depends on guys behaviours. I've been noticing my mood depends on guys lately.

Before all this, I was doing quite good. I didn't had any guys or contact and was quite doing mentally okay.  
I have history of having really up and down periods. I also got some help from professionals with it. Because I got certain 'autism' that makes me feel 'emotions' very intense. Also gained some PTSS because of some really bad experience with an ex boyfriend that was a narcistisc that completely changed my life.

So my mood can be just up and down. Before this it was doing quite good. I distanced myself with guys, didn't have my old life anymore that depended on FWB, going out, and one night stands. And really went better mentally.

Until you meet someone unexpectedly when the first guy came with interest in me in my life. I made myself the promise I only meet up with guys if there a real potential to it, and say that to them also very clearly. So only serious dates. Nothing less.

So the first guy ive met, and also met up with, was quite fun. He told me after that, he wanted to date for real, and see where it goes. Unfortnaly we didn't live very close to each other (4 hour drive) but the contact was fun at first. But ive noticed his way of staying in contact wasn't the way I wanted it, His way of staying in contact online (whatsapp etc) made me trigger my PTSD somehow.

But what I'm noticing, when everything goes well in between us, my mood was so perfect.  
But when there was a slight change (or thinking there was, good in overthinkgin) my mood was downhill.  Like really downhill.  
Even at some point that I couldn't even do my job at that time when is was at the office. My mood really depends on how he was reacting to me.

I was feeling very down again, like almost at the tip of being depressed. Because my mood depended on him and how he was reacting to me.

I had several nights crying but the next day my mood was perfect again because it was okay again.

At some point I made to decision to stop dating this guy because our way of staying in contact wasn't matching for me. It was really hard for me to do that, but I couldn't handle it anymore.

Still noticed myself checking out his location something, because I was afraid that he was already seeing someone for example or Idunno, I just kinda secretly wanted to stay in contact, even I knew that wasn't a good thing to do.

Then I met suddenly someone else. Ive noticed I kinda forgot about the first guy real easy, so that was a relief kinda.

But now, with the new guy, ive notice I get in to deep with my emotions, that I know that if this gonna be fucked up (that it is kinda getting.. im afraid) im really afraid that I well be downhill again mentally.

I don't know what to do. I'm gonna be starting a new job in sept, and I just don't want such thing a distraction anymore..

It's just so not fun that me emotions can be everywhere depending on such things..

Good enough for sex but not s relationship. So I have recently started dating. Went on a few dates with some women that didn't work out. Then I went on my last date with a woman twice and before I could set up a third she said she wasn't interested. I left it at that and moved on. A couple weeks ago by and I get a text that she misses me and still wants to talk but only as friends. I say ok even though I find it to be a bad idea (I find her very attractive and lovely) We hang at my place next to just watch tv and of course end up making out and doing some things. After she leaves she assures me that she doesn't want a relationship and we shouldn't have done that. She then comes back the next night for seven hours and it happens again only this time she cuddles with me and rubs my hand and lays on me afterwards. She even falls asleep on me. Again after she leaves and she says we are just friends and she just likes the attention. I asked her today why she won't see me as more and to be honest but she lies. After more discussion she admits she's not attracted to me like thst. I don't get that because then why does she want to sleep with me. I feel not good enough. It's really messed me up because I actually do enjoy her company and want more than sex. Im not sure if I should cut this off and stop communicating or just stay for now until she finds a bf and enjoy it.  I feel like I'm being used for the first time in my life and its a horrible feeling. I have never in my life been in a situation like this.

"I got broken up with but believe it was self sabotage from my boyfriend. How can I fix this and support him ? Hello everyone,

  
My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. We have been dating for about a year and a half. He is the absolute light of my life : I feel loved, cared for, trusted and safe with him.  
Everything was going well. We met during our studies, but had to spend one year long distance (due to said studies), but managed to meet often. We were planning to get a cat and move in together sometime soon. I am absolutely sure he is right for me, and I have always believed I was right for him too.

  
Lately, he has been very busy, and I think he is burnt out. He said often this last few weeks that he feels low, depressed. I tried supporting him as much as I could. It was hard to see him hurt, but I knew it would get better. His visa is close to an end and he struggles finding a good job to renew it. He might have to move back to his birth country for a while, and I believe this adds on to the stress he is feeling.

  
He decided to break up with me almost out of nowhere. I felt so shocked I couldn't think straight and I didn't manage to say the things I wanted to. Now, I can't eat, I struggle to fall asleep but refuse to wake up because I dream of him, I spend my day holding his old tshirt in my hand. Common friends have mentionned their surprise in this turn of event, and agree with my perception of things. It could be self-sabotaging.  
He told me he loved me so dearly, and that he was leaving me so that I could be happy. I think he believes his depression brings me down, and that I cannot be happy with him. Yet, he made me the happiest and healthiest I have ever been.  
He says he struggles with guilt for ""not being good enough"". I think being rejected from jobs have reinforced his self esteem issues. he also says he needs alone time, which I understand and respect. He usually goes to therapy, but hasn't had time lately.

  
We will be calling again tomorrow, to talk about all this. I am planning on writing a text to help me say all I want to say : having written notes will help me stay calm and control my emotions better.  
About why I am posting this : I need help, I am lost. I never thought this would happen and im very unprepared to deal with it.  
Do you have ideas how to support someone with low self esteem ? How to show someone they are enough ? Ideas to improve communication in a relationship ?

  
Thank you so much for helping me, I wish you all the best.

  
TLDR : my boyfriend have self esteem issues, and feels he is not good enough for me. He is now burn out and broke up with me, probably as self sabotage. Now I need help : tomorrow we are calling, and I want to show him I am there for him and to support him, that he is enough and I love him. How can I support him better ? How can I help with his self esteem ? How can I show him he is enough ? Communication tips ?

"Can't tell if he's an F-boy need to survey y'all on this guy I'm seeing tonight and whether I should cancel the date bc he is an F boy or keep it on:

TLDR: we had a NSA arrangement for 4 months as we were fresh out of serious relationships-  where we saw each other once a month for sex only. Then had a falling out because he left me on read and i got mad.

History:

* met on tinder (he was visiting his family), both fresh out of break ups. I brought him home because I didn't see a future with him but found him attractive. My first one night stand ever - total risk but it was great. Sent him on his way in the morning and forgot about him.
* he texted me a few days after wanting to see me again. Pursued me. I told him maybe. Maybe if it was a date. He said fair enough, we schedule a date.
* He cancels. Busy with grad school finals. 
* he is in the area last minute, we hook up again. I try and schedule a date, he says he can't do an interstate thing with law school right now. I offer NSA - slim pickings in my area. I was emotionally unavailable and i didnt care if he liked me. I was using him for sex as much as he was using me for sex.
* i stopped texting him first. I kicked him off my socials. The rules were: let me know when you are in the area and we hook up. 
* he does. unprompted one day (he says he will be in town the next two weekends). then leaves me on read and doesnt show up. 
* I text him that it was unacceptable. He apologizes - a lot. Then we dont talk.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months go by. No contact. he texts me. I ignore it. Another month later, he reached out again. This time i text him back, reluctantl. Ive moved near his area. He asks me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: after reconnecting, he took me out on two long dates the past 2 weeks. Kissed at the door. 

The past two weeks:

* he took me on a 6 hour date. a full tour of the area. paid for everything. 
* He sets up another date but has to cancel (only after I text him first). Sick family member, he sends me photographic evidence and asks me out for another day.
* I'm busy that day, we reschedule for the day after. He takes me to the movies, he buys me dinner, walk around. Dance. He walks me home.
* both dates I tell him im not inviting him inside. We kiss at the door - he goes on his way.

He hardly ever texts me, he doesn't ask me how my day is, he texts once a day, maybe a meme, maybe a short message. I text him, something i think is funny, he doesnt react. Sometimes i think its punishment for not being clever enough for him. He takes hours to respond to things but so do I. He is working full time.. At the end of the second date he brought up a sexual thing again and I told him it was out of character for me to have casual sex. Not something I was proud of. He asked if ""our thing"" was a sore spot for me. I told him it was - he apologizes, says its nice learning about me and he had fun.

My friend tells me to ask him out, pay for dinner. I do, he says he says sure. But now I think and reflect.  He didn't ask to see me again, he said my schedule was overwhelming but didnt ask when i was available next. why am i asking him out? is he fuck boy? should I cancel this date?",elephantear11,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cydnh/cant_tell_if_hes_an_fboy/,1690653124.0,1.0

But I'm prettyish, never had any problem in this area and throughout my life (I'm 25 years old) I always had crushes and flings, even a serious relationship once that lasted 4 years. People call me pretty sometimes and the people I've dated always complimented me on this specific area. But now, it's important to mention that I've always been skinny too, but with big breasts and butt. Okay. That being said. During the pandemic, I've gained a lot of weight, like, a lot. I used to weight 121.25 lb, and now I'm weighting 176 pounds. This gave me a LOT of insecurity and body dismorphia, I still feel pretty sometimes, but it's not enough.

"What's a dude gotta do to get a GF? I'm honestly at a loss, and no this is not a troll post.

Stats (listing these just to show, on paper, I *shouldn't* be undesirable):

25m

Bench 250 (just to show I'm fit)

Very high net worth (you'd never know by my lifestyle though)

100k salary (you'd never know by my job title)

Most people would agree I'm between a 6 and 8 out of 10 facially... most likely about 7.5 (aka pretty attractive but not a model or anything. Noticeably good-looking, though)

Really charismatic/funny but in a non-standard sort of way... like I'm very witty and intelligent and a bit quirky, kind of ""march to my own drum""

**The Problem:**

My job makes it so that socializing is tough. While I only work 30 hours per week, these hours are from 3am-9am, a.k.a. GL ever socializing with anyone with a traditional schedule because I sleep at 8PM. That, coupled with the fact I live in an area I know zero people, and I've pretty much consigned myself to only using online dating; I do go out on Saturday nights, but I don't really want to meet my future GF/Wife at a club. I'm not an anti-social person, either--in college I had a ton of friends--I just *can't* do that anymore.

Plus, a lot of my strong ""pull"" traits don't come across. Women like a guy financially set; while I am extremely set, my job title makes me seem poor. My living situation doesn't reflect my ""actual worth"" either, and I don't take fancy vacations or drive a luxury vehicle. I'm not interested in changing any of these things--outside of no dating life, my set-up is extremely ideal for what I want out of life. No stress, basically work part-time, pension after 20 years, and my investments will grow to some pretty massive numbers to create generational wealth by time I'm old.

But on online dating, while I do get a lot of matches, these girls just invest zero time in getting to know me. The only ones who do invest time getting to know me are, and I'm not trying to be a dick, but ones who just aren't in my league whatsoever. Like, again, not being a dick, but... I'm fit, attractive, make 6 figures, wealthy, and intelligent--I don't have much in common with a fat girl with tattoos all over her body and no job. There's also girls who just want a quick smash--I've had sex with two girls the last two months, and they weren't ugly, but that also wasn't ""dating"" whatsoever. 

So, how the hell do you actually date? I had a GF in college, but post-college it seems impossible. I don't meet enough women. I feel like the normal advice is something akin to ""level up,"" but really, I feel like I'm at the point of diminishing returns there.

"Nut sure how to find women I'm on the autistic spectrum and my interactions face to face are always awkward as I seem to have weird mannerisms. 20 years ago (I'm almost 35 now) I managed by meeting girls through forums/chat rooms so that we could develop a certain level of trust over a few months before actually committing to a relationship and seeing each other's faces.

Nowadays, this isn't ideal any more, women are tired of being pestered online and it's more common to rely on apps specifically designed for dates. My problem with this is that I don't really have interesting photos of myself simply because I don't like getting my picture taken and thus got nothing for those kinds of apps. Not only that, my personal style is not something that women nowadays like and thus if the first impression they get is my face, there's a high chance they'll just not be interested.

Now, of course, a solution would be to fix u my looks so that that they match the current fashion trends, but I'm just not that kind of person. I am the kind of person who likes wearing his hair really long, and wear shirts and jeans everywhere, and I feel comfortable being a skelly.

"Breakup and new girl I am 25 years old. Nine of last ten years i was in relafionships. Three of them were pretty long - 2 years, 2 years and last one was 4 years and i was living with this girl in one apartment for 3.5 years. She broke with me 6 months ago. 

I learned a lot from that and i dont blame her. I was good boyfriend but made some mistakes and got too comfortable at some point. I am sure that we will never be together again, even if she would want to. I dont know if I ever be fully over it - we both stepped in adulthood together, learned a lot of things and had kinda special connection I think. Breakup made me kinda different person, but busides that i party a lot since then it was change for good. It made me trully confident and I am for first time in my life able to fully control my emotions and got my true self back. For whole life I was guy that belevied in true romance and I think for now I kinda lost that and I am more realistic. It hurts to accept new reality, but I am fine with that. I think i got my shit together as a man and I am on right life path.


For the past months I flirted with a lot of girls, slept with 4 ones. I am pretty attractive men and never had problems with girls. But lastly I got to conclusion that pursuing with girls that i know I dont want to be with in long term relationship is pointless as I quickly lose interest in them. I got big thing for high inteligence in girl and I care about that even more than looks - some girls that were unatractive for me from start and then i noticed their Intelligence turned to be hot as fuck for me. 

Two months ago i met a girl that is in unhappy relationship, this is her first guy and she is with him for 4 years but from what I noticed she is scared to leave him, she is 22 years old. From the start we both clicked very hard and I rarely view girls as relationship meterial. It never got physical and month ago we decided to take a break from each other. I think she is still in relationship with this guy - she is kinda scared of me beacause i gave her player vibes as there were a lot of women around me when we met. I know this is red flag, but my intuition which rarely lets me down tells me to take that risk.

As I stated before party a lot recently and I know I wont stop untill i will have someone that i will truly want to take care of. Constant partying is not in line with my fitness and life goals, but there is really no way for me to stop it when I am single, i really know that part of myself. I think in next weeks I will decide to contact her again. I dont think if it works it will be rebound relafionship but I am not sure as I stated before my whole life I was jumping from relationship to relationship.

I‚Äôm in my early 30s. I‚Äôve been told I am very attractive throughout my life. I stay in great shape, and am very, very well-off financially. I am well-liked, keep an active social life and am kind and easy to talk to, being quite outgoing. Im a very confident person, but even I‚Äôve had a stretches where the height thing gets to me. Im 5‚Äô3. I‚Äôm *always* honest about this and use professionally-shot, well-representative photographs. 

Just matched with a great girl - she seemed very into me, but after days of talking hit me with the ‚Äúsorry if it seems superficial, but how tall are you?‚Äù I realized that we met on an app where I had forgotten to list my height. I responded and was ghosted. I‚Äôve almost been conditioned to stop responding after this question. 90% of the time, it leads to me being ghosted, or flat out insulted. Very hurtful given how respectful I am even if someone doesn‚Äôt meet my preferences. I get no response being a response, but I‚Äôm allowed to get discouraged when this happens multiple times a day, and an insult is never an okay response.

I have since learned to *always* list it up front but some rudeness still seeps through.

"Men, I'd like to hear your opinion My name is Kira, and this is the story of how my life took an unexpected turn. I've always been a slim girl, and it was something I never paid much attention to until I met Alex. He was charming, and we quickly fell in love, seemingly perfect for each other. Little did I know that my body would become a source of heartache in our relationship.  
At first, Alex never mentioned anything about my weight. We were happy, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. But as time went on, I started to notice him acting distant. He would make subtle comments about my appearance, hinting that I should gain weight. I brushed it off initially, thinking he was just concerned about my health.  
One evening, as we were sitting in a park, the sun setting behind us, Alex finally gathered the courage to talk about what was bothering him. His words struck me like a dagger to the heart.  
""Kira, I've been thinking a lot lately,"" he began hesitantly. ""I care about you, but I can't help feeling like you're just too skinny. It's hard for me to see us having a future together like this.""  
Tears welled up in my eyes, and I tried to hold back the pain that was bubbling inside me. I couldn't believe that my body, something I had no control over, could be a reason for someone to break my heart.  
""You mean you're breaking up with me because I'm too skinny?"" I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion.  
""I just don't think we're compatible in that aspect,"" he replied, his voice gentle but unwavering.  
Feeling a mix of anger and sadness, I stood up, looking at him with a newfound determination. ""You know what, Alex? I refuse to let anyone dictate how I should look or feel about my body. If you can't accept me for who I am, then maybe it's best we go our separate ways.""  
And with that, I walked away, leaving Alex behind with his shallow beliefs. In the days that followed, I struggled to come to terms with the end of our relationship. But gradually, I began to find my strength again.  
I surrounded myself with supportive friends and family who reminded me that I was perfect just the way I was. I focused on my passions, my dreams, and found joy in activities that made me happy. Most importantly, I learned to love myself, flaws and all.  
As time passed, I realized that Alex's rejection had been a blessing in disguise. It had taught me to value myself and to never compromise my self-worth for anyone else's approval. I began to see my body as a symbol of resilience and strength, not a flaw to be fixed.  
And as fate would have it, in the most unexpected moment, I met someone new. A person who embraced me for who I was, who saw beauty in my uniqueness, and cherished me without trying to change me.  
Looking back, I am grateful for the pain I endured because it led me to a greater understanding of myself. I am no longer defined by someone else's standards of beauty. I am Kira, a strong and confident woman, loving myself just the way I am. And that is a love that no one can take away from me.",KiraRai69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d1ctj/men_id_like_to_hear_your_opinion/,1690660777.0,0.67
"I (25F) didn‚Äôt back off when the guy (27M) told me he‚Äôs a virgin, but for other reasons‚Ä¶ So I met this guy at a friends‚Äô hangout and I felt like getting to know him more. We were talking a lot and was making future plans to hang out, and we ended up going out for 3 times after that. My friend told me that he might be a virgin so I asked him in a joking way and he confirmed. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal for me since he comes from a religious country and I‚Äôm not someone who see sex as an important part in dating necessarily, but what happened next was a complete turned off for me. 

The main thing is that he doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the first time I met him this red flag was already showing up but I didn‚Äôt care about it- we went to a club with my other friends and because of the loud music I had to type on my phone and show my friends in order to communicate. Sometimes certain messages is only for certain friends, but this guy will come and look at what I‚Äôm typing every time. Even if I‚Äôm intentionally facing him with the back of my phone he‚Äôll still walk around and look at my phone. 

It also shows in other aspects. He asked if I can put his gym bag in my apt before we go out and every time he‚Äôll follow me upstairs and stand right in front my door when I open it even when I told him I can‚Äôt invite him in the house. The last time when we hang out with our friends, we were taking about something and the topic went to Instagram followers and he asked me what I consider good Instagram followings so I checked his followings in front of him jokingly, and turns out half of his 4000 followings are only fans creators with a very explicit page, and he‚Äôs actively liking a lot of their posts. One of the creators, specifically creates contents about accidentally showing her underwear.

That was a big turn off for me so the next day when he texted me I told him that we are friends and rejected his invitation of working out the second day (with a direct nah I‚Äôll pass). However the second day he sent me about 10 texts in the morning telling me that I need to show up on time and in the end was upset that I didn‚Äôt go. I didn‚Äôt reply because I was being clear. He then sent me 2 reels on Instagram before calling me 2 times at night saying that he‚Äôs worried about me because I don‚Äôt answer. I didn‚Äôt answer because there‚Äôs nothing important. He then texted 2 of my friends asking where I am and that he‚Äôs worried about me. That‚Äôs when I had to send him a long text saying that I just see him as a friend and doesn‚Äôt reciprocate his feelings. He told me he‚Äôs sorry about his actions the second day but is still trying to ask me out. 

I‚Äôve only known this guy for 2 weeks at this point and we‚Äôve only hang out 4 times. This is too much.",gg5588e,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d18qh/i_25f_didnt_back_off_when_the_guy_27m_told_me_hes/,1690660467.0,0.67

"Advice moving forward. Hello,

So I am thinking about deleting Tinder and Hinge. It does not seem to be going anywhere. Unfortunately, the men on these apps (from the 30+ I have gone out with at least) don't have much depth to them, just want sex, are super shy, lie, or have massive egos. I am just saying this about the guys I have gone out with on these apps not men in general. 

I like to talk about intellectual topics (science, history, philosophy etc.), but I can not seem to find guys that are intellectual on these apps despite the fact that many claim to be intellectual.

I still want to date, however I attend a really small university that has a 7 girls to one guy ratio. Most of the guys are taken which is fine and I am happy for them.

I am premed and I try to do premed internships. However, there are very few men in these internships. The majority of which are taken. 

My hometown has a population of about 3,700 people so not much luck here unfortunately.

"Not sure what to do I (M33) have been dating my girlfriend (F25) for a little over 6 months. Background: we‚Äôve met each others family‚Äôs and had all the future plan talks. Just moved in together.

She tends to go out every weekend with her girlfriends which I don‚Äôt mind most of the time. However, last night was odd.

I‚Äôll also preface this by saying we used to share locations with each when going out early on and then we just left it on.  

So she went out with her friend (F24) for some guys bday that they both knew. I had met him one time as well, super cool gay guy. 

We normally communicate with each other throughout the night via text. Around 12am was the last text she responded to, I noticed around that time her location changed to a couple miles down the road. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it until she didn‚Äôt respond to me until like 2:20am. Around that time her location showed her somewhere else in an apartment complex.

She gets home, gets in bed and tries to go to sleep right away no kiss or hug or even look at me. I saw that as odd. I said hey I missed you, come here. And she rolled over. I asked how was the that guys party? You were there pretty long (she doesn‚Äôt tend to stay out at a house party that long). 

She responded saying it was it was a chill vibe but musty but didn‚Äôt say anything about going anywhere else. I asked where her friend was bc normally she‚Äôll sleep over if they go out and her stuff was here. She said she went somewhere with some guys and wanted her to come but she wanted to come home. Another note: my girl was super drunk

All these things don‚Äôt add up to me and then while she‚Äôs sleeping her phone goes off several times. I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to check. Some guy in her contacts named ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù has a few messages showing. I check her phone and it‚Äôs a guy basically texting her wanting to fuck. The message thread goes back to last Sunday, where he says what are you up to queen, I want to take you out on a date to which she replies omfg I can‚Äôt stand you hahah 

Then yesterday night he sends her $100 via apple pay and says he wants to eat her out from behind. She responds saying Dam he ain‚Äôt playing, and this was while we were watching that new who cloned Tyrone movie on Netflix.

He sends her like 7-8 more messages throughout the day to early this am basically telling her he wants to fuck her. She hasn‚Äôt responded. I also noticed she payed some guy Dom 10 bucks via Apple Cash last night. 

Sorry for the long read, but I felt context was necessary. I‚Äôm going on a trip to Europe tomorrow with her and I don‚Äôt know what do. Should I be tripping? And do I confront her? Advice needed

"Ex - Physical touch Hi everyone,

so shame on me (f32) - I actually started dating a co-worker (m39) about 10 months ago. We don‚Äôt work closely together, so at least that wasn‚Äôt the issue.
Insane chemistry, great conversations. He used to tell me he‚Äôs never met anyone he was so compatible (on every level) with and felt so comfortable with. 
Anyway, shit hit the fan in his personal life. A devious ex wife, legal battles and their young child who‚Äôs caught in the middle of his divorce war and suffering as a result of it. He started drawing back, lost a ton of weight and kinda started isolating himself from anyone. He also apparently convinced himself his divorce is something no woman by his side should have to put on her. 3 months ago when it started getting really ugly he ended it with me. Told me everything got too much, he needed to sort out his life and just wanted a hard cut in terms of everything. He‚Äôs even actively looking for new jobs - almost seems like a mid-life crisis.
We ended it on good terms and were in no contact for the past 6 weeks. He was clear on not wanting me to wait for him to sort out his life, so I accepted his hard cut decision and tried to move on, even though I felt like we could actually be really good together. 

Anyway, after 6 weeks of no contact we ran into each other yesterday at work. We had a 10 Min conversation. He looked like shit, apparently things with his ex and all the legal battles and their child had even gotten worse. 

What really confused me was that when he ended it 3 months ago he tried to really get distance between us. Sometimes I even felt he tried to avoid me. But as I said, I respected his hard cut decision and just gave him the space he wanted.
In that short conversation yesterday there was no distance. He stood really close to me, almost too close. Suddenly he reached out and started stroking some dirt off my forehead. That really got me, especially as it was at work. For me being touched in the face feels quite intimate. And that‚Äôs definitely nothing he usually does, as in like normal behaviour for him. And the whole situation really contradicted the whole ‚ÄûI don‚Äôt want us, I want a hard cut‚Äú decision.

To be honest, I still have feelings. So that kind of got to me. And I felt like the whole tldr situation is almost like a mind vs heart thing. Rational mind: distance, I can‚Äôt be in a relationship. Heart: still wanting some closeness.

"The Update with me (22M) and the (19W) year old virgin from my initial yesterday post. Before I get into what happened a some hours ago. Firstly before i divulge today's affair. first i want to say quicky how we met late June. For context.

I'm in a local band(lead Guitarist)and after we perform more often than not we get some women who want to hang out with us after performing. 

One of those Girls(24f)that I had a a few physical experiences with I see randomly during the day and she introduces me to her friend who is the 19 year old. 


She then starts hitting me up on Instagram. We start talking. Just really jokingly, nothing unusual.

We met a couple of times which leads up to my last post of which we spent time in my apartment.

But back to today!

We spoke today at my apartment. And she was very, very fiery to say the least. 
When I saw the look her face. I knew it was going to be combative and it was going to be excruciating at times. 

For the first 10mins she just spoke quite angrily that I didn't show much in her opinion that I reciprocated her. Unfortunately she kept talking over me and cutting me off. I couldn't get a word in to explain. She loved getting the last word over me so I just let her have her Monologue. She spoke quite belligerent to be honest. It wasn't nice to hear. But I listened. And took on board the criticism leaved at me.

She then asks me directly. Do I even like her?
And I tell her that I am but I want to take things very, very casually. Then of course she fucking cuts me off and this really, really fucks me off. To segment things a say and not listen to Me in my entirely is unfair. I raise my voice and not word for word but I tell in essence to fuck off if she won't give me the opportunity/courtesy of speaking. Thankfully she listens. Finally. 

I explain that I didn't feel comfortable reciprocating her touching me and talking about sex given she was drunk. And she surprisingly said she wasn't exactly drunk which I didn't bothering arguing with her about since she was being templemental so I just essentially said I wasn't being rude or ignoring her. I just didn't think she was being serious when she said she wanted sex. She says it was obvious that it was Ok. 

We then talked about a few things and she asks me is it an 'issue that she's a virgin'?

And looking back. Not saying my spine turned to jelly but I probably should have been more forthright in my response. 

I told her 'not really'. But I'd happily have sex with her. I joke about make up sex being the best sex and she laughs which help elevate the mood. I then joke about being the sexist man alive which again gets a funny response and makes me feel lighter about everything.

I explain to her that I want to take things day by day. I tell we are still a huge way off boyfriend and girlfriend. Which she thankfully understood. She then tells me she's not seeing anyone or even speaking. Which I find encouraging.

She tells me she's happy after talking and that we should take a few days break of talking and 'definitely see each other again'. I tell her I agree. We then embrace and I plant a kiss on her left cheek. I then walk her out and say bye. She then audaciously give me a full on quick kiss on my lips as she leaves the main apartment building. I just laugh. You couldn't write itü§£üôà. Quite cheeky. Even hours later I'm still questioning if that actually happened! 

 And that's that. I feel like someone hit me with a baseball bat mid sleep. But there's a understanding now. And that's crucial.

However, there really is a huge difference between a 20 yo and a 30 yo. Surely, we can agree on that? As for why I couldn't date them before - unbalanced power dynamics give me the ick. As a 20 yo, I had no business dating men 10 years my senior. I was a na√Øve a child by comparison and I knew that, so I purposely didn't pursue them. Lastly, the silver fox comment seems to have impressed some of you lol - some people go gray very early in life. Such is the case with my partner and a few other people his age that I know.

"is he into me? I (F20) have a summer job and work with a guy (M18) who I was immediately attracted to. It‚Äôs been 2 months and we‚Äôve been snapping for the last week. We have a lot in common (music taste, tv shows, general personality‚Ä¶) and he is my type all around. We haven‚Äôt had much alone time at work but ive caught him looking over at me a few times and he tries to hang around me with some other co workers. He talks to the other girls more one on one (i do work w him less than they do). Sometimes he asks me for help with stuff. 

He said I should carpool with him and another co worker (they are close friends but shes taken) and then join them to watch a game later. A few days later he said the rest of our staff should come watch too. 

I can‚Äôt get a read on if there‚Äôs any interest on his end. He seems a bit shy around me &amp; also often does ‚Äòdumb‚Äô things. I got excited by the invite but then questioned when he said others should join‚Ä¶

"Thinking about getting into international dating. Any tips for a newbie? I'm pretty close to done with the dating scene where I live in London, UK. I'm not a particularly attractive man so my success rate on Hinge, Bumble etc is pretty low. I get the odd first date every couple of months or so, but usually get ghosted afterwards even if the date went well, I guess women just have so much choice nowadays it's difficult to stand out. 

I've never done well at bars etc here either, again largely due to not being great looking. Been single for over 2 years now and I'm feeling very burnt out and wanting to try something new.

For the record, I'm 28, own my own flat, good job, 6'3 and in good shape. My face isn't great and I'm a bit skinny though which is what I think drags me down.

Lately I've been watching videos etc of the 'passport bro' movement, as well as vlogs of guys from Europe and the US who date in places like the Philippines, Thailand and Latin America, and pretty much all of them say the same thing, that dating in these places is far easier than in the West, and how there's more respect (ie less ghosting etc). I am NOT looking into doing this because I want a sex slave, traditional wife or anything of that nature before I get any comments about that.

I'm thinking this is something I want to pursue or at least give a go. For those of you who've done similar, how's it going?

"Am I just not cut for dating? Be nice please. :( So I'm male. 32. With a learning disability. Looking for a job. Still living with parents because the town I live in is small and we barely have apartments here etc. I'm struggling with looking for someone. I've always been rejected because of my disability. I feel like no woman wants me etc. I've been psychologically emotionally manipulated in High School which gave me severe PTSD because I got bullied and got rejected. 100% true story. Dealing with trauma. Just asked a girl out. Trying to face my fear. She rejected me but she was nice. Think I've handled it well. I also have an over protective mom. Love her to death but she refuses to let me date. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe she thinks me getting rejected again will trigger my PTSD? Any advice guys? My trauma was so bad the girl in question accused me of stalking. Lowered my self esteem so bad I felt like I didn't belong in the school etc. Now I'm having recurring nightmares etc. Let's say she was a narcissist at its finest. Currently going to therapy. EDIT: I always seem to attract TOXIC women. I don't know why??? Even tho I'm a nice guy. It sucks really.

What should I do I need to date someone eventually. I just don't want my mom telling me not to date is all. She keeps saying I have allot of growing up to do on top of that I need a job and need to get my license. Reason I don't have my license is we moved allot. And I have a fear of driving and dying in an accident that I'm trying to get over. I know all the answer for the written test. Just I don't know allot of my friends keep telling me I'm better off being single because I'll have more money and I'll be more happy. But being single is just making me miserable to be honest. I get told I'm a likeable and lovable guy. And I make allot of people laugh and I make girls laugh too. I've been catching girls checking me out lately but I'm too afraid to make a move on them etc I don't like cheesey pick up lines etc. I want to get to know them FIRST and take shit slowly etc. I dont want to rush a relationship if that makes sense.

I hope I'm not the only one in this situation. Can anyone give me advice please or some support? I've been trying to work on my self esteem. Struggling with depression because I'm afraid of the same stuff is gonna happen again if I ask a girl out. Etc. My grandma says men in our family has a history of being rejected by women etc. And have bad luck with women too. Recently I was told my cousin was getting ready to pay for child support.

"Gf [23F] is depressed. Things are improving but its getting so confusing now. Am I [M27] overthinking the situation or its something to worry about? Posting this here again. 

The story is on my profile, however to summarize, my gf has gone through a busy schedule resulting in mental exhaustion and burn out. She told me she cannot handle committment of a marriage though she loves me (thats what she told me in our conversation). I managed to calm her down by assuring her that I will be with her till the end and there is no pressure of marriage, im there regardless. 

For the next 2 weeks our conversations were dry, although I got responses to ""I love you"" and such, things have now gone confusing. She would message first, the conversations are not so dry anymore, they are improving gradually but romance is non existence. Just last time around I would say ""i love you"" and she replied with an ""ilyt"". The next day she would go on message first. Yesterday she didnt reply back with the usual heart emojis, but again messaged first.

I am thinking to stay patient and give her more time. At the same time I am worried about the situation, is she losing interest or losing love for me?",alivemanwalking,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cxvzi/gf_23f_is_depressed_things_are_improving_but_its/,1690651853.0,1.0

"My wierd way of thinking Hi. I'm M26, I haven't been in a relationship yet but I've had sex a few times. When I meet someone I immediately think about having sex with her and how to approach it. For that I feel guilty and I just get down on myself. Especially when I want to make pervy talk about sex theme - I'm always afraid she won't appreciate it and she'll add me to her blacklist. It all makes me feel like I'm some sort of wierdo. Maybe its true about me. Sometimes I just think, ""She'll find and go to a better guy than me, it's hopeless."" Sometimes I don't know what to talk about with her.

And so I started looking for dating purely for sex, indicating it in my profile. Expectedly, the number of matches went down a lot. And even so, there was no sex with those who responded, because I did not meet their expectations.

I realize that my way of thinking will not do me any good, so I ask for any advice how change my self-destructing way of thinking about myself and how to properly communicate with girls.",Amb1ent_fade,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cscai/my_wierd_way_of_thinking/,1690637263.0,1.0
"I feel lost, I was falsely accused almost 3 years and I‚Äôm just not the same person anymore. About three years ago when I was in my senior year of high school I started dating a junior, we dated for two years and I really loved her, she was my first proper relationship outside of flings and hookups.
Never cheated on her, never abused her in any way, worst thing I ever did to her was shout at the top of my lungs after she berated me in-front of one of my friends for an accusation that I was into her friend and jacked off to her‚Ä¶. whom funnily enough I fing hated but long story short that girl accused me of r***ing her 6 months after our relationship ended and on the day my father died, after consoling me and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be there for you and you can cry as much as you want‚Äù

I trusted her with things I had never told anyone about my family and my childhood, stuff that I never wanted people ever knowing about because of the impact it had on me and my family.
She dragged my mom and my entire family into the situation, she never went public with her lies but she made me look like the worst scum on this planet but my family and closest friends didn‚Äôt believe a single word because they knew the type of person I was morally. 
It really hurt to see my mother hear that because she was r***d when I was younger and it‚Äôs really impacted and dictated the way I treat women, it just sucks that she used my biggest weakness against me like that.
I‚Äôve not been able to trust and open my heart to a woman ever since, i feel heartless and I can‚Äôt even bring myself to tell them about it because I‚Äôm scared, not scared of them finding out but scared that history will repeat itself.

"UPDATE: I (24F) feel unsure about the relationship I've been in with 31M Hi everyone. My post didn't gain much traction, but I do want to thank those that took the time to comment. I did read everyone's comments, but I didn't respond. Here's the update:

&amp;#x200B;

He decided taking a break was silly, so he decided he wanted to try again, which I agreed to with the boundary that if he emotionally whiplashes me again, I will be leaving. Honestly, though, I didn't feel much of an urge to go spend time with him or be with him. This week I had a psychiatry appointment and a therapy appointment in which I started to talk to my therapist about how I often find myself in unhealthy relationships with men. One of the things that we talked about is knowing my value and setting boundaries and expectations of how I should be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today he and I decided to try to hang out. Part of me was actually really excited. I missed him. He told me he was missing his girl as well. We started to call, and the topics just felt kinda strange. He was immediately asking me about therapy and what my therapist thinks about how we mesh, or what types of things don't mesh well for us. I felt a little uncomfortable because I feel like what I speak about in therapy is really up to me whether I want to disclose, and despite me saying that the therapy appointment wasn't specifically about him or anything he still pushed for answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to screenshare myself playing a game and I got slightly frustrated and made a couple comments that a particular combination of powers in this game was kinda annoying to deal with. He then asked me if I'm frustrated why am I playing it. I said I'm not that frustrated and I'm having fun. He's made comments in the past about the games I play, that I shouldn't play games that frustrate me, etc. And it's like... Idk I would think he would understand because he himself plays games, but there's times where a game might be slightly annoying but you still enjoy it, right? But anyway, he ended up hanging up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to discuss what happened with him, that I don't like when he makes comments about the games I play and when I should and shouldn't play them. He then guilt tripped me, saying ""I guess I'm just a piece of shit then"" and ""well excuse me for caring about you"" and finally blew a fuse, telling me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I finally have had enough of his emotional instability and immaturity. I don't believe I deserve to be spoken to in that way or treated the way he has treated me. Just prior to me sharing my screen, he had told me that nobody he's ever been in a relationship with has ever been as good at ""conflict resolution"" as I have with him. But then he does this. He's just so volatile, and it's either everything is great or everything is awful with him. I have members of my family that have bpd, and I realized the way he acts sorta these two extremes feels kinda similar to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And regarding him pressuring me for sex, I'm really glad I didn't give in. He hasn't really made me feel cared about in quite some time despite it being such a short relationship. I'm not sure what his intentions were with me, but I don't think I'll ever find out. I've now blocked him and I'm ready for a chapter of peace and healing now. I will be working together with my therapist to get to a healthier spot with myself before pursuing another relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess kinda a sad update but probably not one that was unexpected. Thank you to those who took the time to read and respond. I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I‚Äôve recently started talking to this girl, she‚Äôs 28, I‚Äôm 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we‚Äôre probably more friends than anything else.
We‚Äôve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I‚Äôm shy and I can‚Äôt really find anything to talk about that we‚Äôd have in common. She‚Äôs a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can‚Äôt be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it‚Äôll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cpdqx/need_advice_social_skills/,1690628051.0,1.0
"Help! When to break up TL;DR I've been seeing a guy for a few months (only about once or twice a week, though, so it still feels pretty new). However, I'm now pretty convinced it won't work out long term and I need to end things sooner rather than later, but the timing is horrid and I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and deal with the messy fall out or let things drag out for a month and then end it when there won't be as many complications.  
A few months ago, I met a guy at a mutual friends birthday party (she was hoping we'd hit it off, so it was a bit of a set-up). And, it was fun and exciting at first, but then we kissed and I instantly lost all feelings of attraction when he initiated a French kiss. For context, I've never kissed anyone before nor been in a serious relationship (which he knows). So, I don't know if I just don't like French kissing or if it's related to him.  
A few days after the kiss, I managed to stop thinking back on it with negative thoughts and get my feelings to mostly neutral, but I can't get the attraction back. We kept meeting up, although only about once per week (we were both doing a lot of traveling and I wasn't really pushing to meet up more, although I think he would have liked to). I really enjoy spending time with him and we go out and have fun together, but my sexual attraction towards him seems to be stuck at neutral.  
He's been really nice and is very clear that we should go at my pace, and I was planning on going all the way with him at some point (I need to get some medical stuff done, so I can't right now anyways). But, I'm realizing now that might be worse to have sex when I'm not really feeling it and then break up shortly afterwards? I felt like I owed him something for being so patient (no pressure from him), but now I realize it's maybe more likely he'd feel used?  
The other night, we had a heavy make-out session (all but PIV). And, it was nice but honestly not more than that. And, he seems to be getting more interested and wanting to spend all our time together while I'm just as happy on my own. The last few times we've met up, I've tried to be more careful about not giving him a compliment back just because he gave me one and only saying things if I really mean them, which has definitely led to me receiving more compliments than I'm giving, but I don't know if he'll pick up on that as a clue that I'm not feeling things and drifting away or still be completely blindsided.  
The major problem I have now is when to do it. We'll have to see each other at least a couple times in the next few weeks as we're working on a project together. The only way to avoid that would be if I almost completely cut contact with a lot of my friends for a month since he's more integral to the project than I am (they know we're dating, though, so I think they would understand me wanting to give him space, but I still think it would make our friendship suffer). Additionally, my birthday is coming up in a few weeks and we just started talking about plans for it. I would have really loved to invite everyone over (his friends and mine) and have a party. But, I don't want to drag this out and feel like either now before we actually plan anything for my birthday is the best time or after the project and my birthday have passed. I fear no matter what I do, he's going to feel blindsided and heartbroken. And, I genuinely would really want to stay friends (especially since our friends groups overlap), but he seems to have really strong feelings towards me, so I'm worried that won't work out.  
Is there a way I could gradually end things over a month that would be less painful?  
And, should I go with my plan of saying I really like him as a person and friend, but my sexual attraction towards him just isn't there and he deserves someone to love all of him? Or will that just open the door to bargaining?  
Thank you,

"What‚Äôs the norm for getting with other people when you‚Äôre dating, but not yet had the exclusivity talk? 
So just for context, there is a tldr at the bottom, I (m22) was in a relationship that was pretty not great. I really cared about her (f22) but I just felt unwanted. I didn‚Äôt really communicate my issues and I suppose I approached things with a ‚Äútoxic positivity‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs called. I‚Äôm working on that ofcourse, but then throughout the relationship she‚Äôd used to drop my hand, run away and pretend to not know me when we saw someone she vaguely knew or someone made a comment about me cause my drinks took too long. She also went from all lovey Dovey to acting sick of me all the time overnight and I still don‚Äôt know why. Nothing to be done about that, but I wanna start dating again so obviously I need to look at what boundaries I need to set.

So that leads me to this, one of the things I didn‚Äôt find out till near the end was something that happened quite early. A couple days before we became ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù she had been on a night out with her friend for the first time in a while. As she described it at the time her friend kept pulling guys to speak to her and she couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about me the whole time she was talking to them. This was the first time they went out for a long time. Anyway her friend (F23) later spoke about a night they went out after my ex had broken up with her ex, that my ex was necking off with and getting with every guy she introduced her to, and my ex confirmed that was true but I didn‚Äôt say or think anything of it cause I trusted her. At the end of the relationship I found out she literally rebounded with me straight after breaking up with her ex (M?) though, I‚Äôd actually originally been led to believe there was a few months between me and her ex but it was actually only a couple of weeks. So given the timeline her friend must‚Äôve been on about the same night out cause my ex said when I asked that was the only time she‚Äôd been on a night out since she broke up with her ex before me.

So I guess I wanna know what to expect out of dating for the future. I didn‚Äôt really care when I found out tbh cause it was already over, but I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve been bothered if I found out at the time. Is that something that‚Äôs ok for people to do after dating for a couple months? Me personally I wouldn‚Äôt make out with someone in a club while I‚Äôm dating someone even if we‚Äôre not exclusive, or even if I have a first date planned cause it doesn‚Äôt feel morally right. To me dating others is fine before going exclusive but I feel like dating and getting with strangers in clubs shouldn‚Äôt coexist. We weren‚Äôt exclusive at this point, until a couple days later, but she was thinking about me the whole time apparently. Should I be cautious of things like this for future, or is it just a part of dating? Should I be setting boundaries for this sort of thing earlier on?

Tldr - my ex was getting with guys in clubs while we had been dating for a couple months but before we were exclusive. Should I be more cautious of things like this in the future or is it just the norm for dating?",NoHead1128,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cwib2/whats_the_norm_for_getting_with_other_people_when/,1690648254.0,1.0

I mean as long as you're not looking for something casual, or that you're not for example in a place just for a few months and are looking for a casual partner just for the time you're there etc. you're automatically dating "" for life "" right ?

If a relationship lasts 1 year - 3 years, it's just because it didn't work out, I'm not sure anyone is looking to date for 3 years and stop.

"The idea of ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to date I don‚Äôt know what this post is going to be, a discussion, looking for opinions or just me trying to say something I can‚Äôt say anywhere else.

For a while now I have this idea of ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to date. I am 19, really introverted and was never interested in relationships, probably due to my shyness. 

I don‚Äôt have many friends and now in college/work (I‚Äôm doing dual studies) it‚Äôs not too much better. 

More often than not I feel lonely, and the thought of a relationship with someone you can share everything and having physical closeness just makes me‚Ä¶ happy I guess? Or more sad, since I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before.

This is just a thought that regularly comes into my head and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Just wanted to share my thoughts on here. What do you guys think?",_ser_michael_,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cw032/the_idea_of_needing_to_date/,1690646948.0,1.0

"I (M21) getting confusing signals from my friend (F21) I have this female friend situation i really need some advice here

For context im in my early twenties so is she. Ive known her for about 2 years now and have been friends since. We met over a mutual friend. And I notice that Im starting to fall in love with her. The problem is‚Ä¶ she really confuses me

When I ask her do do something she says yes when she has time and seems exited to see me shes very touchy and cuddles with me when were on a couch or something. She takes random pictures of me and even had me as her lockscreen on her phone. But shes not a big texter and very rarely asks me out back. 

The way shes physical with me feels like shes trying to make me make a move.  For example we where lying on my bed and shes hugging me and lying on top of me for a little bit but as i do nothing she stops hugging me again, slaps my but jokingly or starts playfights. 

The problem is that she says she doesnt like men and relationships or intimacy that way. She even had a girlfriend before.

Im not making any moves because she told me that but i feel like she also gives different signals. Im also pretty insecure and scared about relationships since ive never been intimate with a girl before. And have been hurt badly before. 

What im i suposed to do im noticing im falling in love and i dont know what to do i cant read the situation properly but i also dont want to loose her as a friend. And i dont want my heart broken again:(

"Relationship problems Me (21F) have been in a relationship with my partner (21M) for almost a year now. We are very different in many ways, he is more extroverted and I am very introverted. I would say overall that our relationship has been pretty good. 

However I can't help but worry that we might be too different, he is of more conservative values and I'm more open minded with how you dress, what you do and stuff... generelly. So sometimes I feel like the things I want to do in life is without his support nor understanding. And lately the things he's saying and doing really upsets me. 

First of all he is white and uses the n-word a lot especially when we are with his family. I don't think he means it in a harmful way towards black people but still I cringe every time he says it, cause I feel like it is wrong for us to use it and especially so casually. I just don't know how to bring it up when we're alone and how to confront about it without calling him racist. 

Another thing is how he has been with other girls when we are out and drinking. He is always touching some other girl (on the back or shoulders) and to me it just seems unnecessary. Like I understand that he is more social and likes to interact with people and be friendly, but the touching really makes me uncomfortable. I would only touch a guy like that if I was flirting and that is what I feel like he is doing.. flirting.. This is something I did mention to him one night when he was being extra flirty with a girl and I just had enough of it cause I felt like it was embarrassing for me as his partner to sit while he was constantly fishing for another girl's attention.

 He has promised to not act like that again and says that since I'm his first partner he doesn't know where the boundaries are at. But I really can't seem to let it go this time, it's like I don't trust him the way I used to do. 

Our sex life is also getting worse, cause lately I just don't have the desire for it. I'm still attracted to him but I just can't relax when we have sex. I'm also lying about getting orgasms cause he always ask about it and wants me to say when I get one, so I'm stressed about trying to orgasm instead of just being natural and just being in the moment... 

I know that we're over the honeymoon fase and sometimes we will disagree on things, but I shouldn't go around being annoyed and frustrated and worry about how he interact around other girls.

"How do I give green light to be approached (according to the western expectations)? I (20F) come from a more conservative country and am used to guys being aggressive and insistent in their approach to dating and girls dressing nice, taking care of their appearance and waiting to be chosen. Therefore I still struggle to adapt to the western dating style. 

I've been told by my friends that guys rarely approach me because I don't signal to them in any way that I want to be approached. Now, first of all, that presents a logical fallacy: if I signal interest to a guy and he takes the bait, doesn't that mean he approaches me because he thinks I am interested in him and therefore am an easy target rather than HIM BEING INTERESTED IN ME? I mean, I would want a guy to approach me bc he thinks I'm beautiful, not because my interest strokes his ego. That's just humiliating for a woman. 

Second of all, how do I do that, like technically. I'm not talking about randos on the street; but, apparently, here, acquaintances, guys from the same college etc. when they engage with you at a party or in any other social gathering they expect YOU to indicate an interest in them before making their intentions clear. Then a) when a guy starts talking to me how tf do I differentiate between a guy who is gauging my interest and a guy who is just making conversation in a friendly way? And b) how can I signal to a guy I am available to be pursued without sounding too eager and making a fool out of myself? I've tried giggling at their jokes in a slightly fak-ish way, especially at parties, but my friends say that it's still not direct enough.",Morrolan_,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cpfpf/how_do_i_give_green_light_to_be_approached/,1690628243.0,0.63

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that? I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

"I‚Äôm not attracted to my type‚Äôs type I (23m) had a conversation with my friend (22f) recently and she brought up dating and I mentioned that I usually see a trend of most people who might be into me are not the sort of people I'm interested in, such as on dating apps or a little bit in real life. She said that if they like me, it means they're probably on my dating level.

What I didn't tell her is that I'm just not into these women. I'm not really attracted to their face, they're usually on the overweight side, which is fine and can be attractive since curves exist, but in my case, I usually don't find their body type attractive either since that's lacking in any capacity. They usually smoke weed and have some tattoos.

I don't know why that would be my dating level, since I don't smoke, I don't have tattoos, I'm thin, and not exactly exploring alternative types of lifestyle. Nothing wrong if you do, but it's just not for me/not my lifestyle. I'm not sure if I should just learn to lower my standards in that respect.",OpenSesameTime,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cdjvc/im_not_attracted_to_my_types_type/,1690589261.0,0.86
"Narc ex (21M) begged me (21M) for another chance but then left me to be friends with benefits with someone else, what? Two weeks ago I left my narc ex because he was a horrible human being, I‚Äôll make a short list  
\- Slept with someone else the same day we broke up (multiple times)  
\- Made out with a 14 year old (he is 20)  
\- He supports school sh\*\*ters and terr\*rism  
\- Mysoginist and red p\*ll  
\- Objectifies people for sex  
\- Anger issues  
\- Wanted to k\*ll his ex girlfriend  
\- Cheated on me once a week (not always physical)  
\- Tired to break up with me once a week (we always talk it out)  
\- Everytime he tries to break up with me, he talks to other 10 people  
\- Slept with pr\*stit\*tes   
\- Emotionally and verbally abused me  
\- Stingy as hell  
\- Will leave you at the side of the road at night if you make him angry  
\- knew I was a virgin and was willing to wait but when e realized he had to get tested before we get intimate he changed his mind (he still did it in the end with a lot of convincing)  
\- Said he was willing to wait for me to be ready but kept pressuring me through break ups  
\- I always planned the dates  
\- Etc  
So basically I break up with him and block him permanently, a week later he manages to contact me begging me for another chance, telling me he was depressed and was willing to put in the work, this had never happened so I believed him, fast forward to two days later, he says he changed his mind because someone else who is ‚Äúsl\*ttier‚Äù than me, wanted to be friends with benefits with him‚Ä¶.   
I‚Äôm the only second person in his life he was/wanted to be in a relationship with and he knows he‚Äôll never find someone like me (that I have special) , but he chose to have sex with someone else instead of waiting for me, I gave him so much unconditional love but he chose to be selfish.  
I try to talk it out because I know he is disordered and impulsive, he manages to have a moment of clarity and agrees to get back with me but then he loses it and starts cussing me out telling me to leave him alone and he isn‚Äôt sure what he wants, I block him.  
How should I see all this? I am not jealous of the new guy because my ex told me himself I am better, he just chose him because of sex, but it still bothers me, how could he choose something so frivolous over genuine connection? And if I had given him my virginity, would he still be with me?",pixelthoughtz,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cr9q5/narc_ex_21m_begged_me_21m_for_another_chance_but/,1690634150.0,1.0
"Anyone else can‚Äôt stand the dating process? It feels like a waste of time some days. I don‚Äôt even want to put the effort in anymore. I just want to go back to when I felt safe and satisfied. I hate that beginning/ middle stage when you start to get attached but then they start to get ominous. Maybe because they think they have you already so they start to act differently. Then eventually the ghosts start to come out the closet. And you think to yourself‚Ä¶ ehhh I‚Äôm good. Thanks for your time but I‚Äôm out. But then it‚Äôs awkward because you‚Äôve spent so much time together and with each others friends. You‚Äôre close enough to give an explanation but not close enough to feel obligated to elaborate. 

Idk its that phase when you start to get nervous because you‚Äôre moving into a more serious relationship but now everything they do or don‚Äôt do you hold to a higher standard. You get nervous you‚Äôre about to get hurt emotionally. Past relationship fears start creeping in. You start to not trust them and question more things because you care more now. You see parts he‚Äôs secretive about and instead of being direct and blunt about asking why you decide its better not to know and just cut ties. So you just begin to slowly disappear. 

Then you wish you would have just stayed friends because they‚Äôre super great company and you get along so well.

"Ghosting I (25 yr old male) got ghosted and I don't fully understand why.

We met on one of the popular dating apps. After we had a couple facetime sessions that went well, we decided to schedule an in person date at her apartment. We agreed that I would bring wine and my video game system and we would play video games and build a Lego set (probably a big mistake on my part), although she did have work the next day.

After driving down to her apartment to meet her, I immediately began to set up the game system, chatted with her a little, and eventually after a little struggle with set up, we finally started playing. We drank some wine, played some video games, and talked. We were struggling to keep a extend conversation due to the amount of things going on, and I decided to flirt with her a little and I kissed her. This was probably my biggest mistake as it was very quick and awkward. I did it because I wanted to show that I was still romantically interested. Looking back though, it was probably creepy and probably what really killed the vibe, along with the dying conversation.

I then proceeded to stay on her couch a little bit longer while I sobered up to drive home and eventually said my good byes, and left.  She did text me after I got back home to see if I was ok but it's been radio silent ever since.

This isn't the first date I've been ghosted (3rd)  at so I'm starting think the problem is me. What can I do to at least not be a weirdo and maybe get a second date, or even a response.

"I (27f) can‚Äôt tell if my partner (33m) is love bombing me or is actually into me 
TLDR; 3 month relationship, not sure if this is moving too fast, jump down to examples for context

I have been talking with therapists and they seem to agree that I have an anxious avoidant attachment style that I‚Äôm actively working on healing and was told it may take at least a year being with someone to actually feel safe in a relationship. One of my therapist and I talked today about insecure vs. secure attachment and I brought up love bombing and how I have had relationships in the past that were heavy love bombing in the beginning and very intense but tumultuous and short lived (ended around the 2 month mark every-time).

I‚Äôm currently in a newer relationship after my last one that was 4 years. We are just coming up on 3 months with a month and a half of dates/talking prior to making this exclusive. My partner (33m) is very sweet. He is kind and attentive, honest, and also honors my ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù and gives space when needed. We send a few texts during the day to just check in but see each other every weekend and our communication and comprehension is amazing. He has also told me he goes by a motto that if he‚Äôs going to spoil himself then he wants to spoil his partner as well. Honestly I have never been treated in a more loving way, even when we have disagreements- I love it but it feels scary to me because history has always started out feeling good before the mask falls down when I finally get settled into the relationship. 

My therapist sent me a link I requested to a website on what exactly love bombing is and I‚Äôm confused on what is appropriate at this point.

Examples:

-prior to us being exclusive when going on dates he did insist on paying for a lot of the dates but didn‚Äôt argue when I said I wanted to pay or split the bill

-conversations did not start out emotional/deep but slowly got deeper as time went on

-prior to exclusivity he got me a t-shirt and handmade glass cup I said I liked when we were out on a date. He had offered to get me more but I told him no, that was too much. He gave no push back.

Since the exclusive talk: 

-he has got me a dress, 2 handmade bracelets, and cleared my smaller wishlist on a cheap clothing site I‚Äôve been using as I‚Äôm losing weight 

-my car got broken into at his apartment complex and he called out of work to spend the day with me to make sure I was okay and got home okay after talking with the police

-my car was also towed from his apartment another time because I parked in the wrong spot due to no available parking in visitors and he insisted he cover the bill for me

-he sent me money to order out food for us to have a dishes free date night and told me whatever was left I could keep. I told him no I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and instead got us dinner with the money then used it to buy him groceries since he works 2 jobs 6am-10pm Monday-Friday and doesn‚Äôt have time or energy to go to the store. He never had food at his place so I stocked him up. He told me to keep the remaining for gas, time, and effort

-we do say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to one another already. The first time it was even brought up- we were drinking and talking about our past selves- he had indirectly said it (said he felt very strongly and gave me a look) and I said I didn‚Äôt want to say it yet because it felt too early but I understood what he was saying, a week later we were getting off the phone and he said it by accident and apologized but we have started saying it more often and open

-we FaceTime to sleep every night for the last month

-my mom and sister came to town and I told him we were going to go see a movie he and I had talked about seeing together but mom hadn‚Äôt purchased the tickets yet and he got them for us as well as got himself one. I had said I thought it was too early to meet parents but it actually went really good for a movie day (he just said hello and chatted here and there before parting ways right after). It impressed my mom and sister for sure. I have not met his yet and told him I do not want to meet them until around 8 months, he agrees this is a good idea 

-he tells me at least once a week how great he thinks I am and how much he admires me and goes into detail every time 

-he doesn‚Äôt try to control me/what I wear except on 2 occasions where I was going out in a short romper and the angle he was sitting at let him see too much leg/butt- he said it was fine after he realized it was longer than what he saw at that angle and the other day when I was wearing a sports bra and shorts while FaceTiming him and I guess too much cleavage was showing and I was going to step out on my balcony to bring my cat in

I feel like he‚Äôs a keeper. It feels good and easy being with him, and I don‚Äôt feel weird about any of it until I start comparing or reading into it which is Normal I guess as I deal with anxiety. But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs all appropriate at this early stage. And I also don‚Äôt want to self sabotage.",ThrowRA_ifeelsilly,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ccf69/i_27f_cant_tell_if_my_partner_33m_is_love_bombing/,1690586282.0,0.91
"23 F in a 7 yr relationship Me and my boyfriend have been together from school. We broke up once but got back after almost 2 years. Things were normal and very sugary in the beginning of our second term but as the final years of our college approached we started having more arguments and couldnt give each other time much. My college got over 3 month before him so obviously i was free and needed more attention ahich again led to arguments because his semester wasnt over yet. We somehow managed that as well. But now both of us are free and since i am preparing for exams im not free the whole day except early morning (not that early, 9 to 10) i expect him to talk to me during that time but he wakes up very late and is almost absent the whole day on any social media and then texts me at night when im not free.  
  
IK I can be considerate here as he says its the only free time he will get before his joining but i never stopped him from sleeping. i just asked him to adjust his timings a bit. So when i said about this to him he started saying its not a big deal to take out 10 mins for him in the afternoon for him. But my point is when we can comfortablt have a 30 min to one hour conversation then why settle for 10.  
  
Also this year i planned out his birthday. Decorating room and surprise gifts with his favourite Waffle cake (it might not be a big deal but it was very special for me as it was the first time we would be together after celebrating all those ldr birthdays at junior college and at home during Covid). But when it was my birthday he didnt do anything except posting a story on instagram. I agree he was very much under stress due to his semester and exams but its been a month since then and even now he hasnt done a single thing for me. Not even a peice of chocolate. And when i say this to him he either laughs it off, or says he has planned something very big which he will do soon or im just not understanding enough to understand how his situation was during my birthday and all of this plus me being at home added more to his restraints so im being insensitive talking about this again and again.  
  
Am I expecting too much? What should I do. I feel like his efforts are gradually diminishing and whenever confronted he asks me to speak for myself. Im very disturbed due to all of this.

"Sigh* another failed talking stage. I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for almost a month.

He doesn‚Äôt ask to see me and when I ask to see him, he‚Äôs always busy. i‚Äôve been distant for about a few days now and he got upset that I‚Äôve been distant but he has no idea that I‚Äôm just doing what he‚Äôs doing. he said that our conversations are repetitive and and he feels that it just fizzled out. he never communicated that to me until now and he ended our talking stage. he also told me that I was being too sexual all the time which is definitely not true. he would tell me that all I want to do to him is kiss him (i mean‚Ä¶.of course i‚Äôm going to say that. like i like you hello??) and I‚Äôve never met a man that doesn‚Äôt like attention like that.

"How do I break up with my boyfriend peacefully? I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 years, but I don‚Äôt feel anything for our relationship anymore. 

He‚Äôs becoming a bum to me and even though I‚Äôve tried everything to make our relationship spark again I just can‚Äôt. We started dating before COVID hit and when it did we didn‚Äôt have much to do, so I would accept going to his house often. A few months after we got together he got cancer and fought it for about a year, and because of that we couldn‚Äôt go out or do anything because he could‚Äôve gotten really sick and we just didn‚Äôt want to risk it. 

Well, fast forward to about a year ago he wasn‚Äôt working. His cancer wasn‚Äôt really bad (we caught it before it had a chance to take over) so his healing was quick. This is when I started to think about the future of our relationship. He was not doing anythingggg. He wasn‚Äôt working, wasn‚Äôt going to school (I was finishing up my bachelors at the time) he would be playing on his PlayStation, would go out with his friends late at night, buy expensive parts for his car, but didn‚Äôt have a single dollar whenever we went out, couldn‚Äôt even buy me a coffee or pick some flowers from down the block because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time or money for that‚Äù. 

I hate how he would use his cancer as an excuse and that ‚Äúhe was healing‚Äù I won‚Äôt lie, it did make me feel bad and felt like I was being to harsh, but in reality I was trying everything for us, I would drive, I would buy our food and outings, I would buy him stuff and it got to a point where I thought I should just date myself. 

Anyway, he finally got a part-time job, and signed up for community college. I graduated from college and am looking for a job in my career. I started to think about our future and to be honest I see nothing, but then I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish and maybe he‚Äôll change. 

Should I leave him? If I do, how do I tell him? He‚Äôs very dramatic and cries every time I mention a break or break up between us, which just makes me feel bad and say never mind, but I‚Äôm tired of this. Will he change?

"How do you think rationally / know when to pump the brakes when a potential relationship is going really well? Hello! I am pleased to be asking such a question! Background: I (25M) have been texting a girl (24F) for about 6 weeks and we started going on dates 3 weeks ago. I met her at a party I hosted through a mutual friend and we hit it off really well, she asked for my number, and we started chatting. I usually am quite analytical and calculated, but this time things feel very different. We both immediately felt a good chemistry, can talk for hours, enjoy each other's company, text / call often, etc. The sex is also incredible and includes lots of laughter and comfortable communication. 

We both have acknowledged that we want to date, and she's even said ""tell me when you're ready, because I want to be with you"". This is really sweet and I would even go as far to say that she could be the one. We have similar life / family goals, similar humors, share similar careers, and just vibe really well together. I have told her that I want us to really flesh out the details of a relationship before being official and she thinks that's wise. 

That being said, I have two questions really:

1. How do you personally determine if someone is really the one / would be a great partner without letting yourself get too excited?
2. What goals would you like to achieve before officially dating? (I.e. convos about the future? Hanging with friends first?) 

Bottom line: I really like this girl, she really likes me and I have really good feelings about the potential here but I don't want to put the cart before the horse and ruin a potentially healthy, satisfying relationship.

"Is it weird that I‚Äôm uncomfortabel with my Bf en Bestfriend texting. So I‚Äôve been dating my Boyfriend for 4 Months now and he is the first guy I actually introduced to my friends. After dating for 2 months I thought it would be fun to invite my bestfriend to go out with us. They instantly clicked and there was no awkwardness whatsoever. My bestfriend is always someone who gets along fast with people, she is a really social and confident girl. Me on the contrary am really socialy anxious and not as confident as her. There been situations where I was interested in a boy but ended up finding out they liked her instead. I always tried my best not to get jealous of her but I‚Äôm still a human and things happen. But I do really love her she is such an amazing person and just like a sister to me. So anways I used her phone once to call my bf because my phone died, after that sometimes if I don‚Äôt answer my phone he would text her instead because we always togheter. But today I saw that they also have eachother on snap and also text there. Not a big deal ofcourse because I know my bestfriend and she would never do something to me but Its kind of weird knowing they are texting because I do know that my bf obviously thinks she is hot. All his friends already talked about how hot she is in front of me. I know that she is in his Private story but that really doesn‚Äôt matter because he only post meme‚Äôs, the thing I really hope is that he is not in her private story because she post alot of thirst traps on in it and really sexy pictures and it would be really weird if my boyfriend sees that. I wanted to ask her if he is in her private story but didn‚Äôt wanted to come across as suspicious towards her. I actually know for a fact if I would text his bestfriend on snap that he would freak out and say that Its really weird and all. I also know that if I would just tell my bestfriend I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the idea of them texting thats she would stop texting him and even delete him but I really don‚Äôt want to come of as this jealous controling girlriend because it‚Äôs not really like they‚Äôre texting in a flirty way its more joking about things and stuff like that.

"Discussed Exclusivity and Nothing Changed?? (M24) (F25) Hi,

I‚Äôm a little lost in my current relationship and would love advice. I‚Äôve been dating a woman for several months and the dates have been wonderful. She has initiated several, and finally we discussed exclusively seeing each other at the end of our last date. She said yes, but her behavior makes me question myself.

She never initiates conversation about how I am. I see her online, but I don‚Äôt seem to be a priority.  She never continues conversations, and if she doesn‚Äôt like a question I ask her she won‚Äôt answer at all. 

I don‚Äôt know if I see the label of boyfriend/girlfriend to mean something different from her? I know I‚Äôve only been seeing this lady for a couple months, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that a woman that is interested in a man romantically would like to see or talk with him more than once a week? Or at the very least check in on him?

"How to deal with wanting a relationship, but knowing you want to stay single Might be antithetical to this sub reddiy, but i figure if anywhere has good dating mentality advice it would be here.

24m, I have never been in a relationship. That is something I have wanted for probably a decade and a half you know, but no one is attracted to me, this is a big source of insecurity for me. I'll see a pretty girl in public, then just get so down and hateful of myself, it hurts a lot. I know realistically I could improve myself to a point where people might start liking me physically, socially, emotionally and financially, but I think by the time I am good enough I would be like 29, which is far to late to start dating you know. I know I am still 'young' and can learn, but the threshold I feel I would need is so far past where I am. By the time I am good enough, all of my peers would be very far past me. 

I realized last year also, that I value my independence so much. I have the freedom of disappearing to go camping for a weekend, I can spend the whole weekend just reading if I want to etc. 

 I logically I know I would prefer to stay single, I value my independence, and i know how much risk there can be in dating, but emotionally it still hurts, it hurts to be unwanted. I have a great career, I have hobbies I love so fucking much, I  don't mean to sound arrogant, but I have a lot going for me personally, but even with this the insecurity of feeling ugly and unwanted can kill me at times, halt my progress for days, sometimes weeks at a time.

I know I cannot get rid of the human desire to want to love and feel loved, but I was wondering if anyone had ways to mitigate that, and all of the insecurity and self loath that comes with it. I want to be able to go out without hating myself you know.

Also just a quick note, this is not to say I have given up on improving myself.

"Correct me if I'm wrong On Relationships and Truth

We were sitting in the office canteen just chit chatting when I overheard someone saying do you know they're in a relationship and the conversation went on as follows,
Oh really ? For how long?
Last two years dude, started in the third year at the college fest 
Let's see how long they stick to each other 
-- why do you say so...?
Because I heard he is seeing another girl..she is in his team

I casually turned to see , they were a bunch of freshers enjoying the gossip
I started thinking why people think 'relationship ' as physical relationship between opposite gender?
Don't we have relation with our parents, children,spouse,friends, neighbours , colleagues?
The current generation or generation z as we call them have become so casual about relationships.
It's very important that we realize that superficial does not last long
We should maintain a certain level of respect for all relationship

I DM‚Äôd her on Instagram asking for the picture she took of me, and all she said was ‚Äúyeah‚Äù and sent it, which was nice. Only thing is that usually girls who like me have a much bigger response to what I say, but she openly told me that she doesn‚Äôt really go on Instagram that much anyway

"Ghosted before a 1st date? I wasted a front row concert ticket. I had been occasionally chatting with this guy on a dating app. He mentioned that he had wanted to meet. I had an extra concert ticket that I didn't want to sell or waste so I invited him to go with me. We confirmed that we'd meet by the ticket area at a specific time. 

I am running late due to crazy rush hour traffic (1 hr drive) and tried calling him to notify him. He answers but says he allegedly can't hear me.  I used the voice to chat option to apologize and notify him of my ETA. He responded that it wasn't a problem . 

I arrive to the concert area and texted him.  He said he was standing by the ticket area. I also confirmed I was standing there. That's when he said he was standing in a different city and blocked me on the app! 

I'm a generous person and thought it would be a fun first date. I am an educated, successful, and attractive mid-30s woman and don't have any problems getting dates (trust me).

"My (18M) crush (18F) is dry over text but was amazing on the date 
So this girl and I know of each others presence since nice months now.

On the day of your high school graduation I told her ‚Äúlisten are you single‚Äù. She said yes. So I said cool if you‚Äôre looking for something let me know. (I know it sounds very stupid)

Now my happenstance, she and me are in the same city. So she stays 14km (8.7miles) away from. So we decided to meet. 

One day before the date and after the date ended till night the texts were amazing. Somehow after that day the texts became very dry and boring. The conversation has become dull. I am the one who talks interestingly. It‚Äôs not that she doesn‚Äôt text first but it‚Äôs just boring. 

I told her how I feel pressurised to uphold the conversation and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm talking to myself. She was quite understanding and assured me but still things haven‚Äôt improved. I don‚Äôt want to force her to talk to me because that seems desperate. 

Yesterday I found out that she has a history of hookups in the previous city we were in and even had a guy best friends. We aren‚Äôt that close that I should bring her hookups yet. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about her. The date we went on was the most amazing date I‚Äôd been on.

"The contact seems a bit getting distant suddenly (or am I just overthinking?) Hi guys!

I got a thingy here;

3 weeks ago I \[29F\] met a guy through Twitch. \[30M\]  (I stream also, so common interest) I randomly joined his stream one day, I thought he was very good looking. I added him on instragram, but with no intention (yet).

That same night he saw that I was still online quite late, so he started the conversation through instagram DM asking me what I was doing still awake so late. Since then the contact was quite 'intense' but very open and very nice.At some point I asked his number, so we could continue our conversation on Whatsapp. It was still very intense contact, and very open to eacheahtorer. He told me I seem very fun, bubbly open person, and he liked that. It felt very natural, and he didn't had that feeling before with someone he met through twitch for example.

He told me he was very curious about me, and he wanted to get into a Discord call alone with him, and game together.

The first appointment we made I cancelled because I felt ill, he said he was really looking forward to it, so he was bummed we didn't had that call that day.But we called the next day. Was very fun, open, easy and outgoing call, velt very natural and fun like we know each other for years.

After that call finished he told me he even was a bit nervous for our first call together, thought that was kinda cute. He really was curious about me, and wanted to see me in real life. I also wanted the same.

So after.. think about 2 weeks we met up, I traveled to his place.   (1 hour and 30 on public transportation)|I already told him on beforehand, that I only meet with guys up, if there's at least some potential to get something serious out of it. (I'm just done with al the FWB, and one night stands) and he agreed, and has the same.

I was at his place, it felt very natural, like I've known him for quite a while.Since he picked me up we didn't stop talking.And I even stayed at his place. Yes, we did has sex, normally I would wait for that, but since we don't really live that close to each other and it felt okay I was like f\*ck it.

After that date, I went home, and I texted him, how he was thinking about all this and he just want to see where it goes or is this just it.He told me he really liked it, and wanted just to see where this goes.Okay great you would think!

The contact through whatsapp still kinda stayed the same, on beforehand when he was for example live-streaming, in between the stream he would send me small texts like to ask what I'm doing etc. Or when he was finished, asking me if I'm still awake.

Last few times I wasn't awake, so I didn't react to that. Because I wasn't planning to stay awake every time. (he livestreames till 2:00 am, and I wanted to get my bedtime routine back to normal)

Since then I've noticed he isn't like really texting me that frequently anymore. I don't know if it's because he probably thinks im not awake anymore, but ive noticed he isn't texting like he used to while he was live-streaming. Like almost nothing anymore.

For example, yesterday in the midday we played Fortnite together for like 4 hours, but after that I didn't got any text anymore, not the full day and even after his stream.

Is it because he thinks im probably not awake anymore or is het just kinda losing interest? I don't anymore. I know im a really good over thinker.

Do you guys have some advice or tips perhaps? What should I do? Maybe let it depend on him now and not texting him anymore or? I really have the urge if he for example didn't texted me by tomorrow to ask if there's something wrong maybe, but that's perhaps not the best thing to do..

Really would love some advice here or tips on what to do. ",MariekePiekee,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cjcn6/the_contact_seems_a_bit_getting_distant_suddenly/,1690606737.0,1.0

"i (28F) Ghosted a breadcrumber (30M)....but was it too late? I met someone I liked on OKC and we met up for a date. I had a lot of fun with him and the night ended in sex.

We dated for about 2 months. But about one month in, we got into a pretty big argument about our status. I liked him at the time, but I was also seeing someone else. he was seeing other people as well. its worth saying the physical connection was very much there.

We made up and kept seeing each other. about 2 weeks ago, we went out and it came up that both of the other people we were seeing hadn't worked out, for unrelated reasons. We also laughed about some pretty crummy dates we had gone on recently. I said something like ""well, I like you and now neither of us is seeing anyone else."" We got into talks about our relationship and it ended in a pretty heated fight. Not great.

We made up over the phone a couple days later. Within that argument, he had told me he felt like I didn't communicate enough day to day, so I started texting and reacting to his IG stories more regularly. I thought this might be a good sign, that he wanted to connect more.

Over the course of a few weeks, he said I was the most fun date he'd ever been on, best sex hed ever had, best kisser, and he was always rock hard around me (true from what I could tell), that he had talked to me about things he hadnt talked to other people about.

While he was always responsive, I started to notice he didn't initiate very often, though he did once in a while, usually when I was really busy. one week, I went on a girls trip and he started texting me a lot. we sexted, but also spoke more than we probably ever had, about everything. I was feeling really connected to him

When I got back, I was excited to see him. But he just got more distant. I tried to make plans....he was busy. by now it had been 2 weeks since we'd seen each other (trip included) and I was really confused. Why had he been texting me so much while I was away if he didn't even want to actually see each other? I started to think he was just using me for attention. he was also taking a longer time to respond. he was breadcrumbing me. I stopped reaching out.

Over the next week, I went silent, he started to initiate. I ignored, still thinking about what I wanted to do here. I am attracted to him and I know he knows. He reached out to me 3 times. but it was all shallow stuff, like ""hey, how have you been?,"" complimenting how I looked in my IG story, before finally sending ""????"" But I dont care how many times you compliment me. If he likes me, he should want to see me, not just complement me on instagram

Knowing I needed to move on, I downloaded a dating app. day two, I saw he ""liked me.""  I matched with him, but I didn't start a convo (and on bumble you have to). The time to start a convo got down to the last hour and he extended it. I  said his profile pictures looked familiar (I had taken them) and he complimented my photos. I regretted it. I blocked him on both the app, and IG.

Look, I know this is stupid, but I know most of you have been here. We're probably not a good fit... I know. I am trying to move on.

The truth is, I want him to reach back out, because it did feel sort of good to know he was actually noticing my absence. I liked thinking that he missed me, that he was stressing when I didnt respond, that he was surprised that, despite how much he knew I liked him, I would walk away. Him realizing I wasn't quite wrapped around his finger as he thought.

In hindsight, I think he kinda liked riling me up about him a little, because our fights were very avoidable. At this point, I probably wont go back. I have been going on dates with new people.

And I know its just guessing, but I'd like to know what was going on in his head because I'm kinda in the dumps about it and its making it harder for me to date. I'd like to be able to trust myself when I feel chemistry again, and not be fearful that its all in my head.",Different-Total3557,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cj9et/i_28f_ghosted_a_breadcrumber_30mbut_was_it_too/,1690606426.0,1.0
"Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl

So, to sum it up, I can't get hard with this girl. She makes me anxious and when I'm with her sex is in my head all the time... Other factor is that she is way more experienced than me and she talks about sex with no taboos at all, this is very new to me and makes me compare to this other experiences she have had.

On the other hand, I'm seeing this other girl at the same time that attracts me way less than the first one and I can have sex with her just fine. I know this means something, but I'm starting to really like this first one (maybe I'm in love?) and this whole situation is making me very anxious and uncomfortable. I really want to get my erections back. What do I do? It's driving me nuts! 

I know I probably should treat this anxiety I have with her, but it's totally sex related. We've already tried to have sex more than 5 times and could only once for just a few minutes, all the other attempts were failed and left me completely ashamed. I've already tried viagra but even that won't work with her. I need to get over this, it means a lot to me. We've talked and she said it's fine and I'm trying to assure her everything will be okay but as of now im starting to think maybe I should just brake up with her, which I don't want to do.

"Guy asked me to hang out and didnt reply to me when the day came. What went wrong? I 21F saw a post in a group from this guy asking a few days ago if anyone was going to the upcoming music festival, I messaged him and said I was and he told me that him and his friend 23M are going and want someone to come with them, they told me that they had an apartment in the city we'd be staying in and that accommodation wasn't a problem. I told him that I too had an apartment of my own there so I wouldn't be staying at their place. He was fine with it and invited me to go to the beach with them and said we could all ride in his car, I told him i already have a ride and cant go into random dude's cars, he said they totally respect that and it was just casual convo until he asked me how much would i rate him 1-10. That was random but it kinda started getting sexual which I wasn't comfy with, he laughed and said its okay and that my boundries were great. He asked me to meet up today just to meet each other since we are going to the festival which is in 3 days, and i said sure, he then was like ""this is my first date with a ginger girl"" and i corrected him saying we're just hanging out to meet each other before going to a festival, he was like yess you are right. It was a very flowy and good conversation and he never attempted to actually break my boundries, just tested what i was comfortable with.  
  
Well, that was a few days ago, this was the day we were supposed to hang out since he mentioned it a couple of times, he told me then that he'd text me today the plan where and when we were going and I already planned my outfit and makeup and everything. I waited and waited, nothing came up.  
  
I respect people's space and I am not a pushy person whatsoever, but I sent him a ""hey, we going tonight?"" to which i didnt get a reply to. I saw him post a story with his friend that they have packed for the festival. Like, they wanted me to go with them and ghosted me after I said yeah? This really weirded me out, i just dont understand what went wrong.  
  
Why did he lead me on? Did i do something? I thought I'd have friends to go to the festival with but now i cant even go, cause I'll be alone. His posts in the group were also very needy-like, the guy himself told me they would like a girl to come with them cause ""two dudes dont look that good together""  
  
What was their actual intention? The dude was very nice to me, i didnt get bad vibes off of him but I still would like some feedback, thank you reddit! :)

"I (31M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (33F) for over 4 years now and I might be crazy but I think I'm accidentally in love with someone else... So, look...
I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman I've been seeing for the past 4ish years. I love every moment, good and bad. I've grown a massive amount since we've met and she's always been good to me but we've had some pretty fucking rocky moments in those 4 years. I wouldn't say I'm ""happy""but overall she's nothing short of a wonderful woman. 
BUT!
In the last 6 months or so I switched jobs and immediately found myself unusually attracted to one of my coworkers. I've obviously met and worked with many women before, some VERY attractive some not. I say unusually attracted because I can't look at this woman from 500 feet away without my heart beating funny. I'm not a stupid man but she makes me fucking stupid lol. She immediately turned me into a 13 year old boy again and I didn't even know her name. From working with her we've had to talk and she's so fucking funny and she talks and jokes like me, and I'm not exactly normal, so it all seems so profoundly abnormal to me and I can't get her out of my head. I'm not really a betting man but for whatever crazy reason I think she feels the EXACT same way, just a strange intuition feeling I constantly get when I see her. It just FEELS so mutual.

"When I put ""looking for relationship"" on dating apps I have different experiences. Opinions? I'm curious Hello! this is a throwaway account but anyway, I'm looking for opinions and experiences to understand a phenomena. I would like to see men and women points. I'm completely aware that what I'm sharing has my personal biases and also my ego manifesting.

To give you some context, I have no issues ""getting"" women offline, mostly on bars and clubs, but online things are a bit different. Offline usually I hook up with younger attractive women (let's say  (15,10) years younger than me) that are able to give me an immediate validation as a man either by sticking around or sometimes having sex right away.  Online I tend do attract some good looking women, usually closer to my age (I would say on average 5 years younger) and with most things happen in a pace I can feel the woman really desires me. Feeling desired as a man it is really important to me.

I'm actually looking for a relationship and realistically I would prefer a woman closer to my age, so  most of my real dating (not hookup) prospects come from dating apps.

The problem is that whenever I put that I'm looking for a relationship on apps, and this is not something I always do, I tend to attract some women that I think are a good fit but I often have the impression they treat me differently.

I started to realize that some of them, because they know I want a relationship, they change their behavior in order to look more ""relationship material"" (I hate social stereotypes but they still exist) and at the end they fail completely to fulfill my need to feel desired as a man by taking the physical things really slow. To me it looks like they are either more interested in the idea of a relationship than being with me or they are purposefully withholding sex to make me to invest even more but I can tell from conversations this is not their default sexual behavior (example: usually they sleep with a man much faster but now they want to take things slow) which I think it is very manipulative.

I'm thinking now that I can't just put ""looking for a relationship"" because whenever I do this thing will eventually happen. I happened to me to be in a relationship, much younger, that after a while I realized I was not truly desired but an emotional support only and I would not like to be in this situation again. 

I understand that dating should have no comparisons but many men assess women's genuine interest based on how (fast) physical things happen. I know many women might say when they really like a guy they want to make sure the connection is real but what many men hear is simply: ""this other guy is worth of sex without commitment but you are not"". And to clarify, I'm not comparing 1 date with 3 (small difference with many contributing factors to why things happened differently) but rather 2-3 months of difference in time where there were many dating opportunities and time to get physical.

My final conclusion is that is is better, in my case, to always start dating interactions saying ""I don't want anything serious"", because then I see the woman true behavior, and let it build from there.

Yes and I know men, even though a woman might say she wants something serious, they can still lead her on to get sex, which is a bad behavior. I'm not playing a hypocrite here but I'm curious about what men have to say. Women feel free to share thoughts as well.

"Beauty is not subjective I believe that beauty is not entirely subjective because certain aspects of aesthetics are universally appreciated across cultures and generations. While personal preferences may vary, there are fundamental elements of beauty that evoke a positive response in most people. For instance, symmetry, balance, and harmony are often regarded as aesthetically pleasing traits in art, nature, and even human faces.

My friend, when he asked her later, told me that she is open and might be interested. So I followed her on IG and messaged her... the timing though was horrible.. she was having her end of semester exams and planning on an internship abroad so she wasn't available online at all and was responding to messages so late.. until one day she sent me a vocal message apologizing for responding so late and clarifying the situation.  

I told her it's ok and that it's a shame.. we still talked a bit over messages on IG since me too I moved abroad, but to Germany ( she is in France ).

I plan to visit France when I get the chance and the idea of not getting that date her still lurks in the back of my mind, especially with the fact that she was actually interested. I even liked her more after she reached out to me to explain what she hasn't been available.. all other girls just ghost you.

Anyway, what do you think ? Should I reach out to her again, maybe ask her how are things going on for her and plan a trip in her city, or will that come out as desperate or clingy since it has been long ?",CardiologistEarly483,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cdhdk/should_i_reach_out_to_her_again/,1690589071.0,1.0

"Desperately needing to get out of a dating/relationship rut. HELP! Hey everyone,

Just fyi, I‚Äôm new to reddit and this is my first post. I am a 26M and have been in a dry spell with women for about 5 years now. I have never been on a date before and have only had 3 sexual encounters which were all not very good. I isolated myself all throughout high school and college (I did have some internet and videogame issues at the time which I have thankfully overcome) and never put myself out there. I did have some friends, but I isolated myself way too much. I also never used social media at all, and I realize how much that has hurt me. 

However, I have definitely turned some things around the past year or so. Im currently working at a hospital and will be applying to grad schools to become a Physician Assistant in April ‚Äò24. That being said, I refuse to waste any more of my life living without dating and sexual relationships. It just feels weird that I have barely had any experience at all. I don‚Äôt even consider myself an ugly person at all, but my game around women sucks and I feel awkward at times. I‚Äôve even had women be interested in me in the past, but was too insecure to take advantage of the opportunity. Time has flown by so fast, and I can‚Äôt afford to waste anymore time living like this. What are some ways I can talk to girls without just sounding so generic, I just don‚Äôt feel like I have a lot of interesting things to say. Also, what are good ways I can initiate conversations with girls. I need to gain more confident, but I don‚Äôt wanna come off as too aggressive.

I want to finally enjoy my life and actually have experiences with other women until it‚Äôs too late. This is a top priority in my life right now and any advice would be appreciated. Please help!

"How can i meet women and, most importantly, interest them ? Hi. I'm 25 and lonely. Physically i'm average, the real problem is that i'm awkard and kinda boring to talk to 

The thing is, i'm not a chatty guy, at least with people i don't know well. Back in school/collegue it took me several months each year before i spoke to classmates regularly. I improved a bit since then, but not by much. I can make some small talk to begin a conv, but people just get bored eventually. I just don't know how to make conversation or make myself interesting. I spend most of the time listening to others. How can i even meet and interest a woman in those conditions ? I feel like i'll go nowhere if i continue like this, but also that my attemps to change course are futile. 

Right now, i have a remote work job, so i stay home most of the time, and a dwindling social circle from old friends. 

I just went to a vacation where you're supposed to meet people (and hook up are common), and i can make small talk during meal just fine. But it stopped there, i haven't made friends. I don't drink and i don't have fun in the night-club setting, which i feel is a strong negative in those settings. I don't think it's just a case of ""you'll get used to it"", because i've been on similar vacations 3 times and to night clubs like 10 times: i wanted to force the change, but it refuses to come. On this point i'm not pitying myself i just think it's not for me.


Hobby wise, i go to the gym regularly and take drawing class. Also there, i can make small talk just fine, but that's about it. And these aren't really places for dating. I started salsa class recently (but so far it's the same story). 
I also tried cold approach a handful of times, and it stayed consistently akward, i made precisely 0 progress in hours, i'm not getting better at it. But when i can't make normal conv to begin with, this was expected, so i'm not surprise or sad about that. You can guess how well i did with dating apps... so i don't really meet women

To put the nail in the coffin, everytime i tried asking out or on date a girl i got rejected, like 7 or 8 times (+ during the cold attemps). I know those number aren't really high, but everytime i try it's a kick to my associal ass. My approach is visibly garbage, but i have no clue how to do it",FireZura,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ccl64/how_can_i_meet_women_and_most_importantly/,1690586707.0,1.0
"Bad matched want to date me and seemingly good ones don‚Äôt feel a spark Honestly looking for support or advice. It seems like every person I‚Äôve gone on dates with who is really interested in me is not a good match. I feel like they treat me like their therapist and don‚Äôt offer empathy, care, or emotional intelligence in return. They‚Äôre ‚Äúamazed by me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a breath of fresh air‚Äù and I feel like I‚Äôm being supportive and that support is not reciprocated. 

The people who seem to be on the reciprocate with me intellectually and emotionally have frequently come back with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not compatible but I think you‚Äôre amazing and our goals are aligned and we get along well‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel a spark or enough of one to continue‚Äù or I get ghosted. 

I don‚Äôt have luck meeting people IRL because I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm intimidating to approach. The guys I find interesting are often engrossed in work, with friends, or are in a relationship so I don‚Äôt approach them. I‚Äôm quite friendly and find it very easy to make small talk with women and folks a little older than me (I‚Äôm late 20s). I make small talk with men but they‚Äôre not as responsive to that.

It‚Äôs been 4 years since my last relationship ended and since then I‚Äôve found myself in the above situations or situationships with men who have serious commitment issues. It‚Äôs making me feel like the men I find initially as good matches I‚Äôm not good enough for and the ones who find me really wonderful are not a good match for me. It‚Äôs starting to effect my self esteem and making my anxious attachment even worse because I want to seek reassurance that it‚Äôs going as well as I think it is. I‚Äôm often told I‚Äôm amazing and going to do wonderful things but they‚Äôre not interested in pushing further

Is a lack of spark a bullshit answer? Is it possible there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing in these guys or just missing in general? I‚Äôm at a loss for how to stop this cycle.

"As a real Demisexual..... Dating apps are completely useless After a lot of therapy and working on myself and pointedly waiting to start trying to date again after my divorce. Dateing apps are completely useless. 

It's so weird for me. I am not attracted to physical features at all. If anything pictures are a complete turn off. I want to know what your dreams are, what your goals and aspirations are. Who is your favorite person, where do you want to be when you grow old. 

I find that, literally all men in the dating apps that I sometimes match with, are all looking for just that one thing. Don't get me wrong. When I finally grow attracted to someone I turn into a succubus that only can think about one thing. However if I am not attracted to you, it's like you have zero sexual identity on my radar. 

I use to be able to force myself to do casual encounters, but those were not anything fulfilling or memorable in the slightest. Now I just can't. The idea of casual anything makes me want to throw up.

Does anyone have any pointers on how to go about dating as a self aware and healing Demisexual? Borderline Asexual?

"I'm (27F) Torn (40M)&amp;(30M) I dropped dating apps for this very reason, and yet it happens again... 2 great men fall into my circle at the same time.

I went on a date with P(40M) two weeks after my very toxic relationship ended. When he asked me out I was very honest and let him know what I went through, and that I wasn't ready for a serious or commited relationship. He wanted to try the date anyway, and it turns out, we got along really well. So we decided to keep seeing each other for fun.

2 months in, and he seems really serious now. Mentioned moving in... being against kids, but would have them if it was with me... I realize now we've gone too deep, despite my constant reminders that I'm not ready to be seriously involved.

In the meantime, about 1.5 months ago, I met M(30M) through a volleyball group. He was shy at first, so I didn't notice his interest, but now it's obvious. And honestly, I'd really like to date him too, just to get to know if he's a good partner or not. He does, however, belong to a religion that doesn't accept Atheists, and I know this will likely cause problems with his family.

I know I will have to have a conversation with P about this, and I plan on being fully transparent and honest. However, 1. He knows M, and 2. I could see P being a good life partner for me. I just haven't had time to get to know either well enough, but I feel P is so far along that it would seriously hurt him to hear this.

I'm not getting younger, and have never had a healthy or good relationship before P. I want to have children and be around for their grandkids, so it just ups the pressure to find the right partner right away. I don't want to lose the chance to be with either of them, but I know it's not right to not make a decision.

I know people who find themselves in these situations tend to be judged really harshly. It should be easy to just comit to one right away, right? I just wish it didn't have to be this way, and I just hope the right partner will be the person I chose in the end...

"Coworker Situation So there‚Äôs a girl that I work with. She started a few months ago. I noticed her pretty quickly, she had the kind of eyes you could get lost in if you‚Äôre not careful. She works in a completely different department than me, but I technically have a more senior position in the company. 

A couple of weeks ago she came into my office.  Needed to review a document. She positioned herself at the side of my desk and knelt over to show me specifics on the document. I was immediately aware that if I wanted to I could see straight down her dress, but I‚Äôm not an asshole. I maintained professionalism. Then she stood up as if to leave, repositioned herself *directly the fuck in front of me* and bent wayyy over to continue explaining the document. Again, didn‚Äôt even think twice about maintaining professionalism. 

Fast forward a few days, she stopped by my office for another work related thing and mentioned that she broke her toe. I said ‚Äúoh no, that sucks‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúyeah, look‚Äù and she took her shoe off to show me how it had bruised and monologued for quite a while about how it happened. I‚Äôm in no way one of those feet weirdos, but it just felt so intimate for a work setting and with such limited interaction between us. 

So that happens, and that‚Äôs when I was like ‚Äúhey wait, what the fuck was that bending over my desk move? Was that on purpose?‚Äù To myself. 

The only other real interaction since then was when I had to call her for clarification and she answered the phone with ‚Äúhey darling.‚Äù Which was a super weird superlative to use if you‚Äôre trying to drop a hint. 

So what do I do here? It seems entirely plausible that I‚Äôm completely misreading the situation, and I recognize the my own vulnerability in that I noticed her first. She‚Äôs definitely extremely outgoing, which is the opposite of me, so I might be mistaking common niceties and social mishaps for advancements and I‚Äôm not about to risk my professional reputation on a slim chance. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, we‚Äôre both mid 30s. She‚Äôs a little older and divorced. I‚Äôm just habitually single.

"I (26M) am just not feeling it anymore with her (27F) after 8 months. Should you always ‚Äútalk it out‚Äù or is it worth just leaving? 
This is more about how I handle relationships, less about this current one. 

I feel like I bust my ass and put my all into relationships. I‚Äôm sweet, I‚Äôm a damn good boyfriend, people don‚Äôt fight with me and I usually just get praise. That‚Äôs great. I care about taking care of the people in my life and do a good job of it.

Problem is, and it‚Äôs the case with this relationship, I don‚Äôt feel appreciated. I feel like I‚Äôm being taken advantage of for my time, effort, and money, with nothing to really show from it. I get a few compliments, I get some emotional support when I reach out. She helped me work through some serious grief. But at the end of the day, I feel like I‚Äôm getting a fifth of what I‚Äôm putting in. 

I don‚Äôt see much of a point in talking it over. A lot of the things I don‚Äôt like aren‚Äôt things a discussion will change or that I see a point in mentioning, it‚Äôd be cruel. I could ask for more appreciation and reciprocation for things I do, but that feels like pleading for being told I‚Äôm a good boyfriend, I don‚Äôt want that either.

He often drops off in the middle of conversations, and will go a couple days without reaching out, but when he does, again, conversations are amazing. During this time, we‚Äôve only met in person 4 times. 

I got frustrated at one point and said I would like more consistent communication for this to go anywhere, and he replied with a long text saying that he didn‚Äôt know I wanted more from him, and he wanted that too. 

The attention lasted all of 2 days. I know he‚Äôs super busy at work, but if he wants more than what we‚Äôve got going now, I need consistency or I can‚Äôt let my guard down.

"Something happened and I feel like I don‚Äôt want to see her again. Am I being ridiculous? Hey! 

I‚Äôve [M27] been dating this girl [F23] for almost two months now. I work full time in a hospital and because of university she only works part time at a bar but only like 2-3 days a weeks at most.

Anyway we had some issues but always talked about them. But at this point I‚Äôm sure she will say anything just so I don‚Äôt break up with her. But I think today something broke in me and I don‚Äôt feel so good about her anymore. 

I‚Äôve been working for 2 weeks almost every day. 12 hour shifts and the only free time I had was the afternoon/evening after night shift sleep. On top of that I had very bad shifts, acute cases. We lost young patients and stuff like this sometimes wears you down. So yesterday I have a shift, I‚Äôm ending at 6 pm. We didn‚Äôt agree to see each other that day. She texts me out of blue she‚Äôs sleeping over at my place. So I‚Äôm like okay but I‚Äôll be tired and I planned on just taking a shower, eating something and sleep but we can watch a movie. I just really need to chill out in bed. I explain to her how draining the last two weeks were on me and that I need to chill out. She‚Äôs a future nurse so I tell her how we had some very bad cases that got to me like kids with serious conditions. So she‚Äôs like cool we can do that together. Then she comes over and it takes like an hour so before she starts talking about how we should go out in town because there‚Äôs some event going on and we should go grab ice cream. I keep telling her that we agreed to go Saturday (the event goes on whole weekend) and that I just want to relax a bit tonight. But she keeps asking me to go out with her. So I tell her I would totally understand if she went or in the future if I say I need to relax and she doesn‚Äôt feel like doing that with me we can just meet the next day it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Anyway we stay home, watch movie, get a glass of wine etc. 

So next day which was today morning we talk about my schedule. I tell her we had lots of sick personnel but after Sunday my schedule is all great for August. But I will need Monday and Tuesday. Monday to clean up the apartment, sheets, clothes, floors, windows etc. and Tuesday just for me to do a bit of mental hygiene. But after that we already have plans for trips etc. of course she goes off at me, starts bringing up that I didn‚Äôt even go out with her last night. And this really got to me because I tried my best explain that I‚Äôm exhausted and I would understand if she didn‚Äôt come over and we‚Äôd meet the next day. 

On top of this she‚Äôs mad because my ex gf from like 3 years ago asked me for help. We remained friends but we‚Äôd only talk like once every 6 months over messages. She keeps losing memory for hours and fainting randomly. Doctors are giving her appointments in December and she can‚Äôt pay for earlier ones. So all I did was text her back saying ok I‚Äôll try something. And talked to friend who‚Äôs a neurologist and will check her out. I explained to my gf that from experience I know this could even be a brain tumor and I‚Äôm not even talking to her about anything other than when she should visit the neurologist friend. But she‚Äôs mad about this and keeps bringing it up. And for me it just feels so cold. Like the girl could have something serious and she did help me when Ukraine war started. So why should I not return the favor at least. 

Anyway after all this she apologized over text saying she needs to get used to my schedule and how I work. 

But since then I felt kinda cold towards her. I really dread seeing her again. I don‚Äôt want to text her back.

"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

Recently I started talking to this guy via Instagram. We‚Äôve been texting non stop for about 3 weeks now. But as of recently I just feel like he doesn‚Äôt really seem that into me. And idk if maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it because let‚Äôs be honest I overthink everything! 

But I can see this guy is active on Insta but won‚Äôt text back right away. I had asked him the other day if he wanted to talk on the phone and he said sure. I know he had been having dinner with family so I thought maybe after. Then awhile went by and nothing. He never said anything about it. He hasn‚Äôt made the effort to try to talk on the phone again. 

The thing that confuses me the most is the fact that he still texts me everyday. Do good morning and goodnight texts. Still try‚Äôs to have a convo with me via text. I know him and I are both socially awkward but I tried to make an effort to do something other than text and lowkey got ghosted about it. Regardless, he still continues to text me while at work. Sometimes the replied take up to an hour and I see he‚Äôs active. I‚Äôm just not sure if he‚Äôs leading me on or bored.

It makes me feel like they dated guys who treated them like babies the whole time.

"Trouble after long term relationship My partner of three and half years recently left me. I thought she was the one. We have lived together for about three years and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never loved someone like I love her. We shared finances and we were planning our future together. We were getting ready to move to a new city and everything. I was even looking to propose rather soon. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt in hindsight as that would have made things more complicated.

Things didn‚Äôt end with resentment or nastiness but I am still devastated to say the least. We still love each other but she feels that she needs to take the next chapter in her life alone so she can figure some things out. I still have trouble processing this some days and other days I feel like I can see the silver lining.

My previous relationships before her were long term as well. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for anything serious but I think if I were to get back out there and start talking to other people it might help me heal and cope with the loss and major life change. My only issue is that I honestly don‚Äôt even know where to begin. 

I‚Äôve heard horror stories about dating apps but I‚Äôve been considering downloading something to at least meet new people. I just don‚Äôt know which would be best for my situation. I‚Äôm not ready for anything serious at all. I want to ease into it. Not necessarily looking for hookups but I‚Äôd be open to it if I get to know someone well enough and the vibes are right.

I'd like to have at least 2-3 Girlfriends before I turn 40, since I am actively trying to avoid the whole end up marrying your first partners that happen to a lot of late bloomers I have known or have observed happening through stories online.  And I don't want to only get one person to date.

I know a guy who is a chubbier dude who is now married and has an adopted kid and he met her back when we were both like in our early 20's. 

I do not want any kids, and I never want to be married despite thinking of becoming catholic since I believe in Birth control, Abortion and condoms. I'm not going to go into WHY I am so far behind because that would basically be a book and I wrote a post telling the whole thing before. but it does have to do with Chaotic living situations and taking care of dying and much more disabled than I family members.

There's certain types of people I will never date despite the fact I'm supposed to be obligated to date them, or society says you have to be willing to, I'd rather be alone in that case. I am not attracted to my own race and even if I were 99% of the people that have the most in common with me are from outside my racial background anyways, so I'd end up dating more of those people anyway.

 I don't like curvy women with large breasts and big butts like certain types of models, I like modestly sized, women. 

I started a tinder profile despite not having a flattering photo, swiped nope on single moms because I am not interested in any kind of kids or family, plus i want to avoid sex with a woman who has given birth, nobody should lose their virginity to that and I don't want to hang out with kids or have someone who has someone other than me as their first priority except their parents.

I also swiped nope on black women because as I sadid before I am just not turned on by women of my own race, and I also automatically swiped nope on curvy women because large body parts don't appeal to me. 

Sydney sweeney is pretty as an example but her boobs are just too long and saggy. Somehow I like Mila Azul although her boobs are round but not long and saggy or flapjacks which I find to be gross and I would not have sex with a girl with ugly breasts.

I hoped we could still continue to be cool with one another but he started to fall back. Texts got shorter his effort wasn‚Äôt there like mine.

"Advice for Finding Someone as a Sober Introvert Hey folks, just gonna start by saying the default ""do more of what you like and you'll find someone"" advice isn't going to help here, cause what I like doing doesn't involve meeting new people (not that I hate meeting new people, my hobbies just don't encourage that).

For some context, I'm an introvert that recently started using dating apps to try to find someone cause I'm in a new city with no family nearby and I've been single for over 6 years, that makes life pretty lonely. I really hate using the dating apps because they make me feel judgy and wreck my self-esteem because I've not been having any success. I get likes pretty regularly, but they are almost exclusively from people I don't find attractive and on the few matches I do get the conversation goes nowhere and the one first date I went on went nowhere, no spark. I'm generally a pretty dry texter so I think I make pretty poor first impressions over text. I'm much more engaging in real life, so I need to find a way to use that.

I don't drink, so bars aren't an option, and I don't generally like going out to meet new people, but I know I have to if I want to start dating anyone. So my question is pretty simple, what can I start doing other than going to bars where asking someone out isn't frowned upon or weird? Again, the normal ""do what you like"" advice just doesn't make sense for me and I have no real hobbies that involve group interaction (with new people). I work with a lot of people my age but asking out coworkers feels really weird to me.

"Are black men seen as ugly and undesirable? I'm a 27M and I've never been on a date in my life. I've been thinking recently about something a girl said to me a few years ago; we were talking about dating and I said I've only ever been rejected, and she told me, ""Well maybe they just don't like black guys.""

It's something that's been in the back of my mind a lot and it makes me a little uneasy, especially because I'm a black man living in a very non-black area. I didn't want to believe the girl at the time, but as I've gotten older, I've had to realize what she said is probably true, and that my race is a big turn-off when it comes to dating people.

"How to best explain to my bf just how selfish he is as English is not my first language I‚Äôve (29/f) been dating my boyfriend (27/m) for 8 months now and I have been seriously thinking of breaking up with him. However, I do need help on what to tell him which led me to want to do this.

For context, he‚Äôs my first boyfriend and the past few months have made me see things clearly and I do not like what I‚Äôm seeing right now.

Out of the fights that we had, the worst one was the one we had when we went on holiday to see my favorite band in a music festival. He bought the tix after we had a previous fight as his way of making it up to me while I booked the hotel. 
When we arrived at the event, he got uncomfortable with the amount of people and kept on asking if we could go out and come back later when my favorite band is playing. He kept on doing this until I got pissed off and we went out of the concert grounds. I explained to him that the moment we went out, we won‚Äôt be able to go back to that spot as it is not a reserved place and that every minute, more people are getting in. He knew it was a big event with and estimated 45,000-50,000 people.
In the end, I didn‚Äôt get to watch the band I love and he got upset because I got upset. 

Also, I spent almost 1k gbp for everything (food, hotels) during the entire holiday where I spent half of the time crying while he gets to enjoy and go to his favorite spots.

After 3 weeks, we had an honest talk, aired out what made each of us feel hurt before making up.

Now, he stayed in my house for three days and used up all of my towels, toiletries and groceries while refusing to drive me to work because he‚Äôs tired. I did all the cooking and cleaning while he was at my place.  

I can see now how selfish and a parasite this man is and I would like to ask for help on how to tell him how selfish he is to me as English is not my first language. I want him to understand and feel just how he used me in those instances. He previously phoned me saying all mean things to and one of which is I was using him but it‚Äôs not true.

"Am I expecting too much? I‚Äôm (35M) Trying to get back in touch with a girl (roughly my age) I knew about 10 years ago where I used to live and not sure if I should pursue this or not.  I moved across the country 9 years ago and have begun realizing how much I screwed up not taking a chance when opportunity was there.  I think we were both really into each other but I was so broken from bullying in high school and being backstabbed by people I thought were friends and had huge trust issues so I probably came off as not interested even though I was head over heels for her.

"Does this guy like me? There was this guy (unsure but looks around 20-22M) at my (19F) company that is really attractive, though I rarely see him other then on the hallways as we work in different divisions in a large corporation. I was very scared of talking to him because I have Autism and doesn‚Äôt want to come off as extremely awkward and ruin everything (I am horrible at talking to strangers and was just average looking myself). However, a few days ago, I saw him by chance eating at a restaurant, I sat next to him. I was confused about something on the menu and decided to ask him about it. I said ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù and he started looking at me, so I quickly looked down. But he was very nice, answered my question, and was laughing loudly the entire time while talking to me. I so badly wanted to talk to him again so I asked him how to open the pepper. And it happened, he started laughing (unsure of the type of laugh, but it sounded a bit nervous). When all my attempts failed, he leaned all the way across me to help me open (likely because the space is too tight and crowded to walk across). At the contact, I started blushing, not sure if he noticed, but he started laughing even louder. The last instance is when he‚Äôs leaving and accidentally dropped something, so he went to pick it up and at that moment our eyes met and he smiled and looked away.

So here‚Äôs the question. Why was he laughing? And do you think he likes me or at least have a positive opinion of me?

"Confusing stuff in my last year of college So I (24M) and in my final year of college (I started late due to military service), about to graduate in September actually. In a class during my final semester, I met A (21F) also on her last semester of college. We only started talking 7 weeks ago.

At first, it was casual, just friends in class talking. We eventually went out with some people in the class and after that I started to take an interest in her. I then asked her out for lunch, and it became a semi-regular thing which we would do every few days.

About 3 weeks ago, she went on a weekend trip to another city and asked to meet with me when she came back. Of course, I said yes and we met up at the train station where she came back from the trip. We ended up having a really nice dinner, took in nice views from an observatory, walked together for an hour, and just lost track of time. We missed the last train without even knowing it while we were at a park, just talking about life.

That night, we found a open field in a park to just lie on and talk, listen to music and enjoy each others' company. At one point, we were holding hands and saying how much we liked each other. We planned to head back once the first train came on, but we we continued just goofing around in the park 3 hours past the first train. I did eventually send her back to her place before heading back to mine. After that night we grew closer and closer with more frequent dates etc.

Recently her friends have been telling me to tell her how I feel etc etc and try to convince her to stay after graduation (she's not decided what she'll do after graduating, but she wants to apply for masters back in her home country in a program that will start next September). Another one of her friends even straight up told me that A likes me and told me to just go for it.

I myself, have been accepted into a masters program in the college I'm already about to graduate from, on a scholarship, so I'll definitely be staying here. I honestly don't mind doing long-distance as I've done so in the past and I know I am capable of doing well (the last long-term relationship I had was LDR and she ended up cheating on me when she got drunk and gave into temptation with a coworker she always found attractive blah blah).

This week, I've tried to ask A out for our regular lunches or just to meet up at a cafe, but she would always say she's busy etc. Even last time, when she was busy, she took the time to squeeze in 30min with me if she could, which I found to be really endearing and attractive. Furthermore, in the last weeks, we would text so much until 3am in the morning, but recently, she only texts very infrequently. I went to talk to a mutual friend about this, who's very close with A and she said that A likes me a lot, but the thing about distance is scaring her (Apparently the girls talk a LOT about guys they meet, who knew?). As a result, A has decided to distance herself from me, according to that friend, even though she has feelings.

I honestly don't know what to do because I respect her decision. If she doesn't want to start anything, nothing can be forced and life goes on. Just can't help but feel that this is right person, wrong timing, cuz I feel this could've developed into something special and long-term. It's the first time I'm in the scenario where my head and heart wants different things. Head is telling me if she wants to distance herself and not get into LDR, then don't force it on her. But heart wants to pursue it, even though my head says it won't be respectful to her decision of wanting to distance herself. I'm in a bind, can y'all give me any advice?

Even though we are long distance technically ( we live roughly 2 hours from each other), We were seeing each other almost every single weekend. He was doing everything great and the connection felt strong. We've been together for about 6 months now. He has never been inside of my home only to help me move. I never been to his but I have seen his house and his parents which is a couple of doors down from his. Now we will see each other once a month or twice a month.

A friend of his that actually put us together also mentioned that and said he hasnt dated much in his life and is very awkward in general. He doesn't want me to leave, but it honestly feels like a friendship. I told him before what my love languages are. And he was doing it in the beginning and he has stopped. I like to be reassured and have positive affirmations. And he makes excuses for it now for why he doesn't do it or says he is showing me by actions. Sometimes I feel like I was loved bombed and he just got super lazy. And then there are times where I feel I'm not fully understanding him because he doesn't know how to communicate properly. But honestly, I feel like it could be an excuse. Because he was expressive in the beginning and now hes not. He can feel when there's a shift with me and he will ask questions about it but there is not really any solution offered. I enjoy spending time with him and feel my needs are met in person, apart I do not. This has been communicated to him before.

"Social Anxiety with Girls, should I go to the psychologist? Hi community,

I'd like to have some advice from you. I'm a 26M that never had a relationship or sexual experience in my life, I'm an average looking guy, 165cm, skinny, I work and study, traveled a lot, definitely not too boring but maybe not being interesting enough and/or not showing interest in the correct way.

&amp;#x200B;

I always got along well with women, have a few real friends and this is nice. However, I a-l-w-a-y-s failed when trying to show interest to women and since I moved to a new country (all by myself and alone) a few months ago, everything is being much harder. I basically don't have any woman friend, just a couple male friends. My goal at this moment is to get a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending several hours of my life during the past years just watching PUA's videos and reading articles, posts, advices in general but I can't put it in practice. Although I know that approaching a girl in the street can be so easy and have awesome results, I have kind of a ""blocker"" in my mind that literally doesn't make me take the action to do that. I start getting nervous/anxious in a very high level just by looking at an interesting girl.

As an example: I met a girl a few days ago, we had some nice convos in the first day but I felt myself too nervous and most likely I was looking too desperate that she didn't talk to me the same way during the following days...

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to consider going to a psychologist because I'm so sad and disappointed with me that I'm unable to approach a girl or have a conversation without being anxious and looking desperate to pick up her. What do you think? I know that practicing maybe is the only solution for my case but the problem is that I am unable to put it in practice because of my f\*\*king mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating apps are also bullshit for me, never get matches or the ones I get don't answer me (and no I'm not the kind of guy who say just ""hi"")

In brief, I have 3 big problems problems to solve before even starting a relationship:

\- Social anxiety with women I find interesting

\- Showing interest the right way without looking desperate

\- Be interesting for women

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't say bullshits like ""oh you're too young, don't worry"", first no I'm not too young and second everybody who says such thing was able to have at least one experience, no matter if it was bad or good

"7 month with this girl of talking and telling eachother how we feel and say he has feelings and they are growing Well iv been friends with this girl for a while like 7 years M
25 and she F 24 so va she started this relationship I was just being her friend but I saw that I was getting feelings when we started to talk.
We told eachother how we felt and we both felt the same, both had feelings and wanted to see how it went. I invited her to 2 dates and both time it went great we both clicked. I would also go every month to her work place to drop off food and gifts just one day every month.
Recently I told her that I'm ready to move the relationship to be official and she said she had a lot on her mind and told me she need time to think before she make any decision because she doesn't want to do something she will regret later. I told her that she can take all the time she wants. So I slowed down my texting with her to give her time to think. I will still send her good morning snaps to show that I'm still here for her and she send them back and their personalized to me not like a S and that all.
I'm willing to wait. Told her sister BF what I should do and he said i should have a talk with her. So today I told her
""hope your emotions are doing good amd if she needed to talk that I'm here"" so basically inviting her to talk to me but not being like I need a answer now. She said I hope your doctors appointment went great (context: I send the snap saying I was at the doctors office) I'm just wondering if I should cut it off or wait, we been friends for a while and she started the relationship.

"His boundaries are stricter than mine and he seems afraid to make progress At the beginning of the month I confessed my feelings to my crush (and friend of 2 years) and he returned the feelings. We‚Äôve had a discussion laying out the milestones we want to meet together before considering anything serious (it‚Äôs long distance). I told him there‚Äôs no rush on anything and he agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt rush through it. 

So far it seems like I‚Äôve been the one most responsible for sending messages and suggesting conversations and communication that serve to progress the relationship at what I believe is an appropriate pace. However, he‚Äôs giving me some signs that he feels uncomfortable taking the role of being the one to progress things while also showing that he wants to take things slower than I do. 

For example, I initiated a conversation about our boundaries around intimacy the other day and he seemed a little hesitant to speak up. At one point he asked if I was concerned about it hurting more if things between us fell apart and we had made things sexual. This is kind of concerning to me because I have been working on getting away from the mindset of worrying about how I‚Äôll feel in the future about things I‚Äôm doing in the present because I think it prevents me from living in the moment and is even a little self-sabotaging. Personally, I think it‚Äôs unhealthy (at least for myself) to try and look out for my future self because I figure I‚Äôm going to be hurt either way if things have to end. And if they end before we‚Äôve made things sexual, after we‚Äôve made things sexual, before we get serious, after we get serious, etc. Then to me it doesn‚Äôt really matter because I‚Äôll be hurt in that moment but I‚Äôll never know what the hurt would have been like had we or had we not progressed to a certain point. But it concerns me that he‚Äôs already considering his emotions when things end rather than putting that focus on intentionally building our relationship, whatever that might look like for him at this time. 

Additionally I‚Äôll make suggestions about things we can do to progress things (that are still baby steps!) and he seems very shy to accept or very gently rejects me. He‚Äôs also himself shared that he has a fear of rejection alongside his fears that I‚Äôve noticed about progressing things between us, I feel kind of lost. I don‚Äôt mind being the one progressing things but at a certain point I feel weird about continuously suggesting things knowing that he‚Äôs wanting to move slower or that my suggestions still aren‚Äôt in line with his boundaries in that moment. I don‚Äôt mind the rejection but at a certain point it makes me uncomfortable to continue bringing up these conversations and suggestions all on my own. But if I stop what I‚Äôm doing now I‚Äôm concerned that he isn‚Äôt comfortable trying to progress things even when he might be ready, so things will just slow down and come to a standstill.

"Is it really my fault am I the terrible person Me and my ex genuinely had a very toxic relationship he was controlling because he would say stuff like ‚Äú if you wanna post a picture you need to tag me on every slide‚Äù I generally didn‚Äôt know how wrong this was until now he told me it made him feel special. When he cheated on me he unfollowed every girl for me and uninstalled every social media app when I found out to show he changed keep in mind I never told him to do this he  did it to show he changed. 

Later on he told me ‚Äú you know when I unfollowed every girl I was expecting you to do the same yknow like unfollow every guy‚Äù by this I was utterly confused? Was he doing that to just gain control of me did he really mean it. He used to tell me stuff like ‚Äú if I can‚Äôt have you no one can so I might as well just kill you‚Äù and proceed to call it a joke. I used to find out some things about him like, he used to fetishize asian women I found old messages  of him doing it  and people calling him out saying how wrong it was as his response would be ‚Äú like I give a f*ck‚Äù by this I was utterly uncomfortable and confronted him about it I told him it made me uncomfortable he basically told me it was in the past it wasn‚Äôt a big deal etc. i went on with my day but I did find out weird stuff about him which I lost it.

 Me and him got into a silly dumb argument I thought everything was my fault out of guilt I told him ‚Äú I think we need to break up‚Äù and removed his highlights and everything from my bio when he woke up he was freaking out told me ‚Äú how dare you‚Äù I apologized to him and told him sorry and I didn‚Äôt wanna break up I just thought it was what he wanted he told me it wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôll admit it like an idiot I took it back and told him how sorry I was and my overthinking thought he didn‚Äôt wanna be with me no more he then got mad told me it‚Äôs all my fault I broke promises etc. he told me ‚Äú well if you want me to forgive you you should do something similar like to me unfollowing every girl‚Äù to this I knew he wanted me to deactivate my account without even telling him I did in the past so I did it again. I made a new account where it‚Äôs only him. 

I apologized to him constantly I knew he was a controlling guy so I told him ‚Äú I‚Äôll do anything josh! I will follow any rule you want me too just please take me back ‚Äú I fell asleep I woke up to him saying ‚Äú you know I don‚Äôt mind actually making you my slave for real and you obeying my orders because I owe you and your my property‚Äù I was quite disturbed by this but yet so blinded I told him I‚Äôm ok with it as long as he took me back he made me send you know private pics when we weren‚Äôt together and do certain videos and write his name on my thighs. He would tell me ‚Äú if you don‚Äôt follow my rules I‚Äôll leave‚Äù etc he told me if I activated back  my account I‚Äôll need to give him the password he told me it was My idea which I don‚Äôt remember saying. He gave me this thing called ‚Äúprogress‚Äù where I‚Äôll have to do certain things to get it up so I can be with him again. We were having a normal conversation when out of nowhere he said ‚Äú do u think we should let go of each other‚Äù I said no and I don‚Äôt wanna give up he than had a random out lash and told me‚Äù  I‚Äôm  too much of a sensetive guy my heart is too pure for this generation ‚Äú( I wish I was lying) he then said he is gonna focus on getting rich going to the gym etc and he told me he doesn‚Äôt think he are ever gonna get back together I was heartbroken I still tried to be there for him but he was being rude towards me and stuff he got all offended when I said ‚Äú I‚Äôm here to help you and This is what I get?‚Äù Shifted the blame on me and told me he told me that ‚Äú you knew I was gonna be rude to you if you were there for me I warned you‚Äù 

He was even more mad and told me he never asked me to come back to make the long  story short towards the end he told me ‚Äú I hope one day you realize you lost the boy who really loved you go for a guy who only wants you for one thing‚Äù I was very hurt by this statement this might sound very immature but I sent him screenshots of what my friends said about him and my brother than I just blocked him . Later on he contacted me on WhatsApp saying ‚Äú I can believe you told my brother I tried killing MYself! You told him my trauma?? And many others I can‚Äôt believe it I‚Äôm done with this bullshit‚Äù when I saw this I told him off and gave him a piece of my mind calling him a shitty person controlling told him his childhood isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a bad person etc he kept telling me to calm down but I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances and kept going he then said ‚Äú ok make sure you eat have a good day‚Äù and blocked me. I told my friend nick about the situation he knows I hurt I was nick got mad and told me to give him his username to tell him off I didn‚Äôt want too but somehow he managed to get it and he told him off cursing at him etc

 my ex told me to leave him alone multiple times but he told nick ‚Äú she blocked me I have her unblocked she can contact me anytime she needs help‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt planning to contact him again but that statement made me mad because it was a lie he had me unblocked I told him off saying how could you lie like that he told me well maybe instead of you insulting me calling me a narcissist and sneding me s screenshot of what your friends said  we would‚Äôve fixed this he ranted about how much he hates himself and how much of a monster 

he is bc of one of the screenshots he told me he tried taking s bunch of pills and almost killd himself which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true wouldnt he be at the hospital ? And while driving he tried not to crash into a tree I felt awful and terrible and told him sorry and it‚Äôs all my fault his birthday was today and I sent him some stuff apologizing saying I was in the wrong etc my friend nick told me not to listen and he is just trying to manipulate me but I felt so bad and awful and wrote an apology to him he got mad and told me how dare I tell people about his trauma and how could I not defend his name when my friends were talking bad about me when he defended mine 

he told me I broke another promise because he wanted me to block this guy while we were dating and when he found out I unblocked him he got sad and said I  broke a promise by unblocking him even tho we are no longer together. He told me to leave him alone and he wants no one no friends no nothing and that me and my friends ‚Äúwon‚Äù I felt awful and left him alone.

"Guy checked up on my socials, ghosted after I messaged him Pretty much what the title says. I noticed a guy kept viewing my empty tik tok profile every few months, for around a year (I think longer?), although I didn‚Äôt recognize him at all. One day, after he‚Äôd viewed my profile twice in a week, I worked up the courage to message him and ask him who he was and why he was checking out my blank profile. He was a bit embarrassed, and admitted we‚Äôd talked on a dating app before (over a year ago), and I guess he remembered me from that. 

I didn‚Äôt really get why he was viewing my profile and not messaging me, but I thought it was a bit sweet that he recognized me, so we chatted for a bit. He seemed really sweet and earnest, and made comments about wanting to hang out after he got back from a trip, and told me he‚Äôd like to keep in touch while he‚Äôs gone. 

To my disappointment, he went on his trip and didn‚Äôt message me once, despite being online. Even after his trip was over, I heard nothing from him, so I deleted him. He didn‚Äôt owe me anything since we never dated. 

Now weeks after ghosting me, he‚Äôs viewing my profile AGAIN, and following me on my socials. I sent him a message, letting him know why I unfollowed him, and asking if he wants to talk. I waited a week and got not a single response from him. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some insight?

The thing is I'm going to give some context about my self and her before asking. Since I started working and studying, and now just working I have pretty much left my ""crazy life"" behind, meaning I don't really have the energy to go out and party and being in a an environment full of people, I prefer to go with my close group of friends have a beer smoke one talk and chill. She on the other hand is quite a sociable person likes to party quite frequently at least 1/2 a week all in all that's not really a problem for me. Once I get to know and like someone I like to devote my attention to that person and I don't get romantically interested in anyone else, and I like someone that has the same mindset. The thing here is because she was way more of a sociable life I'm a bit insecure because I don't really know yet her intentions with us and if she is interested in being exclusive I would like to ask but I'm afraid that it's to early for that can someone help me with some advice?  
I can't really read people intentions it's hard for me so I don't know if we are just having fun and that's it or maybe it could be something more

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship because I always thought I was undesirable and feared ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù rejection. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I turned 21 last year lol. My insecurities deprived me of so many experiences. 

I lost my virginity on my birthday vacation, and since then I‚Äôve had a MAJOR boost in confidence. I started taking pictures more, been more outgoing, and just overall more confident in my skin, but not fully. 

I recently made a few dating app profiles, and my God, the amount of likes and matches I‚Äôve gotten is insane. I‚Äôm talking 200+ likes within a 2 weeks and an average of 2-4 matches a day. I never thought I‚Äôd be ‚Äúthat guy,‚Äù it honestly feels weird. I‚Äôve had a a lot of hookups and it all just feels unreal. I lowkey feel like I‚Äôm getting addicted to the attention",WillingnessLazy4064,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c04pt/i_feel_so_weird_going_from_being_insecure_to/,1690557039.0,0.67
"Should i move on or move out? TLDR: my next door neighbour (M20) in my (F20) dorm dumped me in a very hurtful way because he for reasons I don‚Äôt understand wants to be with his ex girlfriend (F18). How can I forgive him? Should I try to become friends with him again or just move out?

I‚Äôm a college student and I live  in a dorm with 12 other people with whom I share a kitchen. We‚Äôre all pretty close, basically roomies. Over the summer me (F20) and the guy (M20) i live next to started hooking up/dating. We kept  it  a secret from the other people in our dorm. We‚Äôre both from the same town so it was pretty easy seeing each other when we were visiting our parents. When we hung out we would go thrifting, go to the beach and flower picking, stuff i thought was date - primarily because he also called it that. Over the summer he met a lot of my friends form home and I even let him sleep over at my parents house because I really thought we were seeing each other seriously. He even asked for us to be exclusive! A week ago I picked up on something, he was acting different and texting me less. I asked him about it but he told me he was just sick.  I accepted that. Also I  didn‚Äôt want to pry.  After that we didn‚Äôt see each other for a week ish. I was certain something was up so I told him I wanted to talk about something. We agreed to talk Monday evening. 

Then Monday afternoon I was texting him and he told me he was meeting his ex girlfriend (F18)  Then later, Monday evening when I get home, I text him again. I want to talk as we agreed to do. He opens my message but doesn‚Äôt reply. So after a while I text him again. He doesn‚Äôt reply to this one either. I can hear someone‚Äôs in his room. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the ex girlfriend. Some of the people from my dorm later tell me it‚Äôs her.  He continues to ignore my texts for a couple hours, when he replies he tells me we can talk when she‚Äôs gone home. It becomes really late and texts me saying we can talk tomorrow.  I am not pleased. So I go knocking on his door. I find out she‚Äôs still in there. However, he comes out to talk.  He‚Äôs crying and tells me he misses her. We agree to talk more tomorrow, as I feel kinda bad letting her sit alone in his room. He tells me they didn‚Äôt do anything sexually. 

The next day we talk. He tries to explain himself but keep changing his explanation. First he insists we were just FWB but later he says we were dating, he‚Äôs just not sure he could fall in love with me, although he thinks I‚Äôm sweet, intelligent, pretty and great in bed. I ask him if he‚Äôs in love with his ex. He tells me no, however he still wants to be with her. She doesn‚Äôt want to be with him. I don‚Äôt understand his decision but i respect it. 

We agreed to just be friends. I want us to be. However, later that night when we were watching a movie together in his room, he said that I could lay against him if I wanted to. I didn‚Äôt.  And I‚Äôm kinda mad he even asked. I feel so used. A part of me thinks that he still wants me. However, I know that it‚Äôs naive. I‚Äôve drunk texted him a few times, asking him what‚Äôs wrong with me since he cannot fall in love. I know I‚Äôve been too much with my messages. Normally I never do that. It‚Äôs like all my pride and self worth is completely gone. I feel so desperate and pathetic. He even told me not to text him about it anymore. I‚Äôve not reached out to him since. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to me either, which makes me question if there‚Äôs even basis for a friendship when I have to take all the initiative. I think about him all the time, partly because I can hear him talking and moving around in his room from mine. 

My problem is that I cannot seem to forgive him or forget him, though I really want to. He pursued me. He asked me on a date. He allowed me to get attached to him. Then he betrayed me and tried to convince me we were just hooking up, making me feel like dirt. I feel like he‚Äôs messing with my head and it hurts so much. I  cannot stand being with him. I hate hanging out with the other people in my dorm when he‚Äôs there, I hate that i have to hide that I‚Äôm sad. My self esteem has never been lower. I really like the people in my dorm so that really sucks. However, I‚Äôm not happy living next to him. It‚Äôs very stressful for me. Therefore I‚Äôm considering moving. Should I do it if I cannot forgive him? I want to forgive him, how should I do it? Do you think we can ever be friends again?  I feel like it‚Äôs unfair I have to do all of the effort to forgive him when he‚Äôs the one who hurt me. I need advice.

"I expressed my needs to my BF and he felt overwhelmed I‚Äôve (23F) been with my bf (25M) for 5 months. I have a good time every time we hang out together. He makes me very secure and safe. And what‚Äôs more, he is adorably funny, caring, and really affectionate. 

But I‚Äôm seeing patterns of issues and things that make me want to have conversations with him.So the past week we had several conversations about these:

\* How often we see each other: I always have to ask him to stay with me for 2 nights on weekends. He would prefer if he only stays for 1 night because he sleeps better on his bed. He mentioned that one time he stayed for 2 nights at my place he didn‚Äôt have a great Monday the next week, and he needed good rest because he has a demanding work schedule (he works overtime), which I totally understand but I get attached and would miss him a lot. To be clear we only see each other once during the week or none at all (I come over to his place during the week cuz I have more flexible schedules). And weekend is usually when we spend most time together. He felt overwhelmed. I mentioned that I want to see him once during the week and 2 nights on the weekend, which made him feel like, at this speed, we were gonna see each other every day. And that is too fast for him. But I never said I want us to see each other every day. I feel misunderstood.

\* Sex: I expressed that I don‚Äôt get very turned on if we jump right into sex. I need more time for foreplay like cuddling, teasing, and kissing. I also expressed that it would be nice if I can keep a vibrator at his place because that‚Äôs the only way I get off and I don‚Äôt want to carry it around every time I visit his place otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. And he feels like I‚Äôm demanding a lot. He even said he felt like I was nitpicking but I really wasn‚Äôt. Sex is important to me and I‚Äôve been finding it hard to enjoy it because of the way he rushes to things.

\* Deciding things for me: I expressed that I‚Äôd appreciate it if he asks my opinions first instead of deciding things for me. I want him to ask me ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre going to this bar, do you want to join us?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to XX. I assumed you wouldn‚Äôt like it. So I decided for you that you won‚Äôt join us without even asking.‚Äù

He said it feels to him that I have been the one expressing needs. He has never done that aka scheduling a time to have this sort of conversations. I mean, I love how he almost always says yes to my invites/plans (for example he said yes to a last-minute concert I wanted to watch). But I feel wronged too. Because I can tell he isn‚Äôt a people pleaser and he doesn‚Äôt struggle with expressing his needs. Every time he wants to do something he says it to me, and if it‚Äôs a no he just politely says no. So he never keeps resentments (?not sure what‚Äôs the right word, like when you did something you didn‚Äôt really want to and you felt uncomfortable/resentful about it- that kind of feeling) inside. I‚Äôm aware of my issues and have been going to therapy for me having difficulty expressing my own needs and setting boundaries, but I feel like he couldn‚Äôt understand my struggles.

Idk I‚Äôm feeling that we may just not be compatible with each other. I went through an amicable yet excruciating breakup due to incompatibility 2 years ago and it took me a long time to heal and be happy again. At this point I‚Äôm just tired and frustrated about another one. I don‚Äôt want to feel that way anymore.

He‚Äôs been a great boyfriend for me. He took really good care of me when I threw up one time and he was textbook good at calming me down when I had anxiety. A lot of things he did make me feel like oh wow that really is a green flag and I feel very loved in this relationship. But when I expressed that I have those unmet needs it led us into conflicts. I‚Äôm willing to work things out and we said we were gonna have another conversation this weekend. But I‚Äôm really anxious and stressed out about it. I really need advice on how to approach the conversation in a mature and healthy way.",Free_Narwhal7302,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bzujm/i_expressed_my_needs_to_my_bf_and_he_felt/,1690556413.0,1.0
"When should you be sure you're ready to date? I feel like it's a complicated issue. Sometimes I wonder if I myself should isolate myself from dating and romance just to prevent any undue toxicity from myself or others. 

We all have issues. We all deserve love. Attention. Care. We don't deserve to unleash out worst traits on someone; and just because we love someone it doesn't mean our bad sides can't be bad for them. Exhaust them. Etc. 

I've had interest in people I shouldn't have because they clearly had some things that needed to be resolved before they could maintain a healthy relationship. But is that a lack of thick skin on my part? A lack of patience? My own issues mixing with theirs in bad ways?

"Nervous About How a Double-Day Date Will Go Hey guys,

So I (30m) met this lady online (29f) and really hit it off. Like more than sparks it's electric kinda thing. So I am not worried about  whether she will like me per se; as it is clear she already does. But she is coming for two days and has a kind of wild side. I told her straight up I would love to accompany her but Im not this nightlife trailblazer and she said its ok we would be there for each other and she would teach me etc. My worry is less about impressing her and more about the inconvenience of bar and club hopping (finding one/waiting in line at this heat etc) ruining the vibe of the date.

"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly. Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He‚Äôs very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He‚Äôs also balding, I definitely don‚Äôt care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it‚Äôs not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he‚Äôs very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he‚Äôs okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he‚Äôs with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don‚Äôt talk about men who don‚Äôt make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he‚Äôs very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I‚Äôm not. 

Like damn, I‚Äôm not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

"{Male 25} how could I bring this up? 
I feel like I have a higher libido than most people I‚Äôve spoken to and been with. 
My previous partner that‚Äôs been on and off for 3 years told me I can bring someone else in if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied enough which I refused since that not in my nature. That broke the dynamic quickly. 

I was wondering if I should joke about my sex drive or mention it in dating apps because I like to have multiple rounds and more than just once a day. (I know that can‚Äôt happen everyday) I know now it‚Äôs important for me so it‚Äôs a must , especially if I‚Äôm highly attracted. 

I‚Äôve never spoken to anyone about this because I don‚Äôt want to come off as creepy I just find immense pleasure pleasing a woman It‚Äôs linked to my love language which is touch.  no drug gives me the same dopamine rush. I find pleasure with giving massages too which all the woman I‚Äôve been with appreciate. 
I‚Äôm very spiritual so i I don‚Äôt act in lust but genuine connection.

I haven‚Äôt really dated around yet so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just naive and that‚Äôs normal but from what I‚Äôve heard not as common.

"How to leave my gf in the most brutal way ? So for the context,

I have been dating my gf for almost 2 years and she is around 3 years older than me.

The problem dating her since the beginning was that she often used to emphasis about her cousin guy and lots of other relative guys wanting to marry her whenever we get into any conflict. I would rather use the word 'flex' because she used to say that she has lots of other option than me. But there has not been a single time when I let her doubt about any girl's name on our fights.

I thought her ego would get washed out with time after sometime but today I realized I was totally wrong.

For the present context , I happened to saw a chat between my gf and one of her old guy , the guy wanting to marry my gf which was also my gf's relative but not by blood. The guy called her for the facetime and after my gf didn't reply, he texted 'kali'. That word means 'dark color skin girl' (with a sense of love). And after few calls here and there they facetimed for some few minutes back and forth.

The problem here isn't that my gf talked with that guy. Back in honeymoon phase of our relationship I once called her you are my 'kali' and she was offended so bad that we nearly broke up and she still sometime taunts me about that incident whenever we have fights. But now she is okay with someone else calling her that word.

Yeah stayed loyal the whole time, loved her to edge but now I am profoundly not okay about what has happened and I think I should breakup with her in a very brutal way that she will regret her whole life.

I understand we had lock downs etc but I'm speaking after all that when people were going out and places were fully open overall. I had tried online dating on and off for the three years and it's been probably the most frustrating and draining experience of my entire life. I HIGHLY encourage people to use it with caution and prepare to be fucked around A LOT. For me I met a lot of girl online and even in person in town but I never clicked with anyone sadly. Intelligence is one of the key elements I look for and my god is it a dying breed. 

I was actually going to delete it again just a couple week ago when I got a match with a super cute girl. I told myself if this shit doesn't go anywhere I'm done. This girl took me by surprise and our first date we took a 2 mile walk and got caught in a down pour on the way back haha. It was kinda like a scene in a movie or something it didn't bother us at all which I thought was fun. We spent the next 3 days together which also has never happened with other girls. It's always ""I'll let you know"" ""I have to see if I'm busy"" all that type bullshit. This girl truly wanted to get to know me and the last girl that did that was my ex I met 6 years prior (Sad but true) I had some casual encounters but nobody I felt something for that was also reciprocated.  

I'm on the 4th week with this girl (28F) and we have spent a lot of time together and I have had a lot of emotions in my head more than I know what to do with. This girl has taken me by surprise at every turn. I guess I have been waiting for something to go wrong or to see if she's legit and I can honestly say she is. I'm just extremely nervous about the future since it's just been so long for me so I feel rusty. 

She asked me if I was serious about her and I didn't hesitate &lt;3 

Do you think we are moving too fast? I know it's literally 4 weeks in but I thought I'd share my story

"I want to start dating, but I feel like I‚Äôm too old and the effort won‚Äôt be worth it. I‚Äôm 31/m and haven‚Äôt been on a date in 7 years. I‚Äôve essentially been avoiding putting myself out there and meeting women since then so I don‚Äôt end up in situations that could lead to dating. I feel like I‚Äôve avoided a lot of potentially stressful situations by doing this and it doesn‚Äôt take any effort. I really don‚Äôt want to participate in the dumpster fire that is online dating and have pretty much decided that I never will, no matter how desperate I might get. I also value my time being alone and my space and have a very difficult time imagining someone else being around me most of the time. 

The issue is that almost everyone I know in my age group is in some sort of relationship and I feel like I‚Äôm at the age where it‚Äôs going to be difficult to find a single woman who‚Äôs the same age as me, if I decided to enter the dating pool.

"How to know when is the right time to ask about exclusivity? I (24F) have been dating a guy (37M) for around 2 months. We don‚Äôt go on dates that often though because of traveling (we had a few trips in this time period) and work. Overall, we have been on 7 dates in 2 months. We do keep in touch over text but its not like we spend every free evening we have together or talk all the time. We started being intimate very recently and I stayed over at his place 2 times. Overall there have been no reasons for me to think there‚Äôs something wrong or any red flags apart from maybe the fact that the dating thing is progressing slower than I would like it to. I have recently realised after some thinking that I see this going further and want to be exclusive. I‚Äôm absolutely fine with doing it slowly and gradually but I have no clue on how to bring it up. I think communication is important and therefore I want to be honest but I don‚Äôt want to sound like i‚Äôm putting pressure on the person but rather just openly discussing on where we stand.

"Why do some people talk about their kinky dating tales (like how their first ever date ended into a wild threesome etc.) the moment you swipe them right on dating apps? So, there are some matches on the dating apps, where as soon as you swipe right, the person hints you about the questions you can ask to initiate a conversation. As soon as you do that, the other person goes like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a really horny story..very unusual and intriguing..‚Äô And when you ask them, it‚Äôs more or less like ‚Äòyou know we ended up having a threesome in my last date!‚Äô 

I mean don‚Äôt they feel weird to share such stories with randos even before a hi-hello?

Does it mean they are trying to initiate sex chats with you or trying to test whether you get offended by their stories?

"4 years ago GoatLord8 found his girlfriend in this sub through a form he launched to find friends who don‚Äôt just send boring replies. What if AI could do that for you? I found a wholesome post on MNFH subreddit where a guy from Sweden launched a form with questions like how fast you reply, how open you are in conversation etc and the 8th response was of a girl from Turkey which stood out to him. They eventually started dating and the guy even flew to Turkey and shared a picture of their [first hug at the airport](https://imgur.com/a/DplfgFi). (can't link the post because auto mod keeps deleting).

What if there was an app where you post your introduction and let AI know what you are looking for. So if you are not someone who like people who text out of boredom or who have other intentions than what you are looking for, you can ask the bot to match people accordingly.

The way I plan to do is by making an app only for redditors out there making friends online where unlike any other social app, there are no comments but only posts where every reply on that post is a conversation. It is up to the person to either reply privately or publicly, in which case he will also let other people discover his thoughts through his conversations.

The AI will use those conversations to know people and make better matches. Obviously when it is a private conversation the AI would be out of picture.

"(Need some situationship advice) He gets offended if I stop being cheesy. I don't want to put in the effort unless we're dating. It's a privilege to be my partner and he's not getting it for free. For some context; we both liked each other in 2018 and 2019 but we were scared to confess so we moved on, dated new people and got cheated on, we reconnected and I confessed first, then we both fell for each other. We aren't dating yet because we're both not ready for a long distance relationship and I still have trust issues from being cheated on. We mutually agreed that we won't date anyone else and we'll date each other next year. 

It's like we're already dating but without the label. He keeps telling me he's afraid of hurting me, afraid of losing me, afraid he won't find another who would put in the effort like me. We flirt with each other on a daily basis, call each other 'babe' and say 'I love you's. The moment I talk to him without the flirting, he gets sad. I'm just thinking, why should I put in the effort if we aren't even dating? I have trust issues from being cheated on too. 

He doesn't have any red flags that I'm ignoring, he's motivating me to do better, he's understanding and caring, he respects my boundaries, there's no doubt he's way better than my ex. 

But if we both can't commit right now, why are we acting like a couple? If he really wants me to flirt and put in the effort, he has to upgrade me to the 'girlfriend' title. It's a privilege to be with me and he has to work for it if he wants me. I want to stop being cheesy with him, but he gets offended and sad. He thinks I'm losing interest. He starts overthinking. 

Is him saying ""I'm afraid to hurt you"" empathy or a warning? How do I stop flirting with him? Or should I?",StillRare7904,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bxdu6/need_some_situationship_advice_he_gets_offended/,1690550622.0,0.5
"Is it wrong that I (F24) paid for the second date, despite my date insisting that he (M24) would pay? He paid for dinner for the first date (which I sorta wrestled him for the check and I lost). Then when we went out the second time, I told him before we went to the restaurant that I'm buying, and he said ""we'll see about that"". I kept insisting that I would pay and he said that he would pay for half then. We go to the restaurant and we're already late for the movie, so we had to rush and I already had the card ready so I just handed it to the waiter. My date said ""thank you"" but also subtly mentioned that he feels like he should've been the one to pay because of gender roles or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel like maybe I shouldn't have been so adamant about paying. I just feel really bad sometimes because I like to order nicer food and bottles of sparkling water when I know I'm paying with my money, especially when I'm out at restaurants (which happened on the first date... he didn't even drink the sparkling water). I fully expected to pay for my meals.  He's a grad student right now so it makes me feel worse having to make him pay for me. I also feel like he ordered the cheaper items on the menu because he didn't want me to spend so much.",ExpensiveSummer45,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bhkcr/is_it_wrong_that_i_f24_paid_for_the_second_date/,1690501956.0,0.72

"My friends are dissing on me (42m) for rejecting a woman (45f) because I'm a virgin who never had a relationship. No matter how I write the title, it still reads weird to me. 

Anyway, 

I had a lot of trouble younger. Between my head that wasn't in a right place, dropping out of school, and a slew of other problems. Others were dating and so on, I was trying to stay alive. Over the years, I managed to get myself on the right track again. I got my head in a healthy place, I got back into university and managed to land a job that allows me to travel after years of not really knowing what I was doing in life. I put some money to the side and bought a house with a garden for myself in a small village.

However, it took me nearly 40 years to get to a place where I felt good, and it took pretty much all my daily time. I did try to date during it, because even other dudes who faced the same issues as I did managed to do so. Online, real life, show confidence, the usual.

I managed a lot of things in life, starting from a bad place. I'm proud of that, but I never got anywhere in dating. After 40, I gave up on it.

My friends know and don't mind. When their families leave them some time, we get to spend some together, and for a few of them the kids are starting to be grown-ups so I get to see them more often now.

They introduced me to one of their friends, who happened to also be single and share a number of hobbies with me. In short, we spend some time together, and down the line she asked me out, I said no. 

I'm over 40, and don't feel like starting to learn now how being with someone actually works, I'm twenty years late for that and she wants an adult, not an 18 year old kid. As far as I'm concerned, that ship has sailed. 

I didn't tell her that, I only said she's cool but I wasn't interested in her like that. 

Of course, my friends learned about me not going for it. They've been asking me endlessly why I haven't tried something, if just for the sake of experience. In a few days they will forget about it and drop it, I hope.

"Went on a really weird date Yesterday I (24 F) matched with a guy (23 M) on bumble. He invited me over almost immediately. I said no but that I was free today. We agreed on coffee and then maybe going to my place. Usually I'd wait longer to go out with someone I met online but I was feeling spontaneous. I did tell him I don't sleep with guys on the first date and he respected that. 

We exchanged numbers. I texted him but didn't save his contact (I was going to if the date went well). He was overly friendly through text and acted like he knew we'd be dating for awhile. I politely told him to slow it down a little bit didn't cancel the date. 

On the actual date we kept a conversation flowing but he was extremely unemotional. It looked like he attempted to smile once or twice but couldn't figure out how to. I picked most of the conversation topics which is fine but it would've been nice if he had brought up at least one. Eventually he went to the bathroom, came back and said ""I appreciate you coming out but I don't think we're clicking. See you later."" I just said ""okay bye"" and hungout at the cafe for awhile. I had a feeling we wouldn't keep dating but it was still weird. Usually when a guy doesn't want to see me anymore (or vice versa) the discussion happens after the date.

"My(31M) girlfriend(32F) keeps stonewalling me whenever we have an argument/disagreement. It's giving me stress and anxiety and I cannot take it anymore. I started dating this girl about 3 months ago. The first month was pretty amazing. But the honeymoon phase ended way too early and we started getting into arguments/disagreements by the 2nd month itself. Whenever we have a disagreement, she sometimes gets agitated and starts gaslighting me. She often gets very angry and shuts me down by saying ""I don't want to talk right now"" and walks off. She doesn't come back until she cools down. If I try to bring up the discussion again, she just shuts me down by saying ""We already had a discussion over this and I hate going in circles"". Now this has happened way too many times for me to ignore. The inability to have a civilized discussion over any disagreement is giving me a lot of stress and anxiety because I'm being forced to bottle up my feelings. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her because I don't know what I do or say might accidentally trigger her and I don't want to get into fights every day. I have also observed that she just cannot handle losing an argument. If an argument ends up in her giving up, she tries to bring up something totally random from the past to keep the fight going until she feels like she has won the argument. I'm really tired of this and have been thinking of breaking up with her.

"I feel weird for not wanting to see her again. I(35M) don't date a lot. Like, it was a few years ago last.

Mostly because I don't enjoy the online apps and I don't want kids so that's a dealbreaker for like 95+% of women. I'm not super motivated as I'm mostly fine on my own, but I do want to meet someone special to build a life together with.

About a week ago I found a nice childfree woman my age not too far away, we spoke for a few days online and it turned out we had some things in common and some similar views on life. This is uncommon for me so I was excited to meet her! We had a date a few days ago and it turned out we had even more in common regarding political stance and such. She's smart, funny and has a communication style that I really appreciate.

On paper, she's great!

But I feel no romantic or physical attraction. Like, at all.   
I'm not curious about getting to know her more, I don't feel like I want to meet her again.

And it's so frustrating!Meeting a woman that is so close to what I want happens so seldom.

"My gf told me two weeks back about her depression and anxiety. Things are so confusing now. Help? The whole story is on my profile, however to summarize, my gf has gone through a busy schedule resulting in mental exhaustion and burn out.

Yesterday she didnt reply back with the usual heart emojis, but again messaged first.

Not sure if thats her love dieing out for me or its just her mental state and she needs more time.

"We spent every moment of two weeks together, now he tells me about the other girl. Sorry about the long post, but this is my first post here and wanted to give the full story.

A month ago (23F) started this thing with a friend (27M) of mine. I was out of a 3 year relationship and had something going on afterwards with a close friend (24M). Let‚Äôs call 27M A and 24M B.  The thing with B had ups and downs and it was never anything exclusive. During this period A started showing a lot of interest in me, texting and asking to do things together. We weren‚Äôt very close back then but I always enjoyed his company so I was always up for it as well. We started to hang out a lot and got along so well. When we got drunk we were always flirting with each other and I really liked the attention and always found him very attractive. Getting along so well was an added bonus. Other people started to notice this and I got asked a few times if there was anything going on between A and I. A friend of mine who is way closer with A also told me that this guy really likes me and I should stop with B whatever that is and go for this guy (also because B was flirting with this other girl). 

I was quite confused at this stage because even though I really liked B it was always a bit problematic with him and now A charmed me a lot. For other reasons we stopped seeing each other romantically with B and decided to stay good friends. 

After a night out together with all of our friends, we went to A‚Äôs place to have an after party but nobody else was up for it. That night we stayed up till the morning and when I wanted to go home he asked me to stay over. We just cuddled all night and spent the next day together in bed, nothing else happened. Next day after a dinner at our friends place, A asked me to come over again, so I stayed at his place and we had sex. From that night onwards for about 2 weeks we slept together every night, spent the next day together and did a lot of fun things together. It was an amazing time but in the end I went back home for the summer and he will move to another country end of summer.

I always thought we wouldn‚Äôt talk a lot when I‚Äôm back home but we texted so far everyday and he wanted to call me quite often. We make each other laugh a lot, have a great connection going on and are very attracted to each other. But he is moving away so I wanted to ask him what would happen then. I never wanted a serious relationship, especially nothing long distance but I felt like I had to communicate my feelings. When I told him that I really like spending time with him and talking to him but it confuses me as well because he is moving away - he replied back with if I knew what is going on with his ex at the moment. I knew a bit but not so much in detail. So with this girl it never worked out because they were never at the same place at the same time and she never wanted anything exclusive at the time with him, so they agreed to see how it goes when he moves back to the city she lives in. 

We never had a conversation with each other about what we wanted from each other, I guess were both sure that we didn‚Äôt want anything serious but then we connected really well and it ended up being more than that. I‚Äôm confused because when I told him about my feelings and doubts, instead of him talking about his feelings he opened up the subject of his ex even though it was never a concern before. It seems to me that he avoided expressing his feelings. When I said maybe it‚Äôs better we just stop, he didn‚Äôt want that either. He said that he really likes me and enjoyed our time but can‚Äôt say anything right now because he is confused. He wanted sometime to think and meanwhile wants to keep in touch. He also asked me if it‚Äôs suppose to be everything or nothing.

Now I‚Äôm left wondering if in the end our connection was not so special and this was a casual relationship. But even if it is, he doesn‚Äôt want to let go of me. I‚Äôm also confused by what it means to have a casual relationship or if he is being a red flag over all.",smallandfurious69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bvf1m/we_spent_every_moment_of_two_weeks_together_now/,1690545479.0,1.0

"Outdated or new normal? Hi all, 

Male, 40, divorced here. 

I‚Äôve been through the ringer the last year, but have taken time to find myself once again and work on myself via therapy, friends and working out, of course. It‚Äôs a process and so I know more time is needed and one is never a complete human. 

My question pertains to a couple of patterns I have encountered while dipping my toe into the dating pool. 

Both encounters for me went way better in person than via text and I felt like I‚Äôd established enough of a connection to maintain contact via text until the next meeting, which hadn‚Äôt happened. 

I am an open person and I‚Äôm not afraid to have tough conversations for better clarity. I would rather someone tell me that they‚Äôre not interested than what I am seeing via text.

It almost seems to me that expressing interest in seeing them, trying to have loose playful conversations before meeting, worked for me in the past. Admittedly, that was before online dating and texting became standard operating procedure.

I understand that maybe these women were not entirely interested in me from my recent experience. I had a good time with both of them and felt that perhaps something would come of it.

My question is, do y‚Äôall feel that the text game is one where you express limited interest, without much inclination to meet in order to be a viable match. 

What I‚Äôve seen on that end, is very limited texting, more recently, a text or two a day with only a couple sentences. For me that put a lot of pressure to say something meaningful while matching their effort. Needless to say, both dates fizzled out in the virtual world. 

I‚Äôm not interested in being anyone other than myself (playing games to increase interest), but I do understand that the nature of dating has changed, the conversation style has changed, and I think, despite the promiscuousness of the scene, people are more guarded with their thoughts than their bodies. 

Am I accurate or am I just an outdated model of a man? 

Help me improve and get a much needed update. I don‚Äôt want to game the system, but I also don‚Äôt want to lose good connections from the wild whilst trying to manage the virtual realm poorly as I see it now. 

Many thanks, and I appreciate ya‚Äôll who take the time to respond and consider what I‚Äôm asking.",FabulousBase9194,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bvaln/outdated_or_new_normal/,1690545104.0,1.0

"Women can love more than one man at the same time. Many men I have spoken to believe women are incapable of loving two men simultaneously.    They are under this illusion that once a woman develops feelings for guy #2, she will withdraw from guy #1.  

I‚Äôd like to share with those who believe women cannot love two men at the same time. 

I‚Äôve personally got myself tangled up twice with women who were in love with me and with their other partner.    The situation was extremely frustrating and overwhelmed with sadness.   

These two women would make out with me and have sex with me but would not separate themselves from their other partners.      They also enjoyed having sex with those people.   

When I found out I ended the relationships but they would cry and become extremely angry and threatening.    They would bombard my phone with texts and calls begging me not to leave, that they would dump their partner to secure me, though that never happened, and would never happen.   

When a woman loves more than one guy simultaneously, this is called polyamory.     She will never let go off one partner for the other.    And she will do her best to meet her partners physical needs.  

Just felt like sharing this.",Lexusowner40,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c41fr/women_can_love_more_than_one_man_at_the_same_time/,1690566141.0,0.33

"I was abused raped then ghosted by somone I love...how do I move on So it's a bit I'd an complex siatiatuon plz dont judge I just need support on how to get over him. So I was seeing somone else for about a month or so and alot happened he was abit absuive you could say? Well my family seems to think so and they think technically he assaulted me? As I told him I disnt want to have sex and espailly unprotected sex but he did pushed it while I was not sober. After that he made me deal with a possible pregnancy and miscarriage all by myself not even giving me a hug or allowing me to doke over during this time. He also barely texts me and ignores half my messages as we were just still just hanging out and not anything yet. 

After this I decided we are done and went on tinder to talk to other mature ppl idk what I was expecting a distraction I guesse. I was just talking to many ppl at once tondiatract myself. But one really stood out eventually I began talking to him eveeyday and our connection because intense we hadn't met yet but it was pretty romantic and both of said we never met or connected like this online before. I know it sounds silly maybe it wasnt real love but it was the begining stage it was more than flitting it was like we were in a realtionship we spoke about everything including trauma and suicide I really opened up and idk how bad his trauma was  ju he shared ally of family issues he had. At that point its more than just flirting the bond we built maybe wasnt so serious but I'd say equivalent to dating somome for a month atleast. Anyway this was happening at the same time I was dealing with previous guy as I matched with this new one just a few days after ending things. I was espially assaulted and showing all sorts of signs of possible pregnancy and misscarraige and maybe STI's? Ofc I couldn't talk to the new guy about this I had nobody to talk to about it after the possible miscarriage I reached out to the old guy and said I need to talk to him about wjat is going on to figure out what to do and I need suport which was a mistake as he is abusive and gave very limited suport if any. He made me feel worse the next day I went to the doctor to test for STIs and I just went to a clinic where they just are understaffed I guesse and pushed me out after a few questions (I guesse they did technically do what had to be done...but I felt they disnt take their time with me) I had more questions but they sidnt have time and just lost it after all this abuse. I know now ita stupid bit I went to the new guy for emotional support I told him everything of how I had unprotected sex and I might have possible Sti I want to get tested before starting anything qne the doctor made me feel worse. I even gave him a chance to say I understand if he doesny like me anymore. He just unmatched and blocked and ghosted. He is usually so supportive I was shocked.  I know that is alot or info I cant expect him to stick around but i thought at the least he would say I'm sorry about ur situation....I told him I got into an argument with my abuaive parents which lead me to go see that guy and not be sober and I was taken advantage of while not sober....so I thought  he would atleast say I'm sorry for what you went through but I need to put me first or I dont feel comfotable I hope you feel better but I cant continue. He just ghosted when I was  vulnerable and I know I know this alot to unload but I just thought atleast a simple "" I'm sorry to hear that but I am not interested take care of yourself bye "" he kept saying he wants to marry me lowkey and have his kids to which I said stop idk if I want marraige and he said I know i cant help how pwegwct you are I want to lock you down and make you mine forever. He also supported me emotionally when I was depressed. I know its alot to hear about stis but ghosting is so cowardly. By no means is he a bad guy but I think it shows he doesnt respect care or ""love"" me as much as I thought he did. Maybe he isnt all I thought he was in my head. He didnt know all the details but he knew I was with somone elses pretty recently which is one of the reasons I thought it was ok to tell him I wanted to get tested first?  I thought we would just wait till I get tested? Again its alot of info for sure he isnt q bad guy but maybe not the one if he is gonna abandon me like that without even a I'm sorry I cant do this.  Looking back out convos where not surfacey but the reason I feel for him is just because he treated me decent/respect well he did treat me well but I mean like he treated me like human which is something I'm not used to as I keep getting abused over and over again in my life. So maybe I'll find somone else who treats me decent too :/ idk I liked him I know its mostly my fault how do I get over him?",spoiledcandy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bufkn/i_was_abused_raped_then_ghosted_by_somone_i/,1690542618.0,1.0
"UPDATE: She asked to be exclusive, I agreed. Then she changed her mind a week later. Big date coming up, and I want an answer so I don‚Äôt waste my time. Hey All!

So posted a few weeks back about a girl I met on Bumble and how she flipped-flopped on wanting to be exclusive.
I appreciate all the advice you guys gave!

We ended up going to the concert/festival together and had a pretty great time.
But - something very important came up that made me change my mind about the whole thing. 

I learned she is still in communication with her ex and clearly not over him. She talked to me a few times on previous dates about how she is still upset with him for cheating on her, but I just took those conversations as her opening up to me. However, at the show she made an effort to tell me that her ex was texting her during the show and again talked about how she is angry at him and really hopes ""karma teaches him a lesson."" 

This was the main deal breaker for me. I know some people get over their exes by jumping back into dating, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. At this point I realized that she's probably just dating around and looking for a distraction. The day after the show I asked for some space and took about a week off from talking to her so I could think things over. That Friday I made the call to end things since she wasn't ready for what I was looking for. 

Thankfully, she was understanding about it and things ended OK. I chose to remove all contact on phone/social media etc. 

I'm still bummed that I gotta start over as I really liked her, but I know that it was best for me to call it there and move on.",AnOrangePenguin,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b6tuy/update_she_asked_to_be_exclusive_i_agreed_then/,1690476361.0,1.0

"Is what my girlfriend is doing toxic? I (34M) started dating my girl (33F) about a month ago. We went official after talking for a while. I suffer from ADHD and many times I forget some small things that were discussed or said. My girl has always been saying that she hates repeating herself because she does that at work with people she manages and it drives her crazy. 
She sometimes makes plans with her friends to go watch a movie or hang out or some shit. Most of the times she tells me. But today she suddenly said she was going to a movie with her girlfriend. She said she told me about but I don't think she did. She kept insisting but I forgot or didn't pay attention. I'm a movie person and I would at least remember the name if she did. 
But since she hates repeating herself, she didn't tell me what movie she is going to or where, despite me asking her a couple times. I kinda find this behavior shady, even though I believe she's not the type of person to cheat.

"Talking phase/ dating advice (24F) and (25M) I‚Äôm (24F) starting to get back into dating and decided on using hinge.

He told me that‚Äôs he‚Äôs about to open another location in Aventura and lately he‚Äôs been traveling for conferences across the US. 

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting. So far he seems really nice and we vibe. Only thing is the past week I‚Äôve gotten a text like once a day replying and or ‚ù§Ô∏è some of my text responses. Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking but is that a üö©? He might just be busy since he texted me that a couple times but i heard someone else say no man is that busy. Again it‚Äôs been a hot minute since I‚Äôve talked/ dated and my previous encounters were in person so Ik online can be different. My sis said that‚Äôs not a red flag since I technically hear from him once a day in the talking phase.

Online dating and IRL hybrid concept So I'm thinking about having a bunch of business cards with a basic online dating profile description printed on them with a Google phone number.

Then I could just go around and hand them out to any girl who I find attractive. As a girl would this completely weird you out or would you be intrigued?

Now I did this fairly often with you. I'd catch myself staring at you. And need to breathe deeply, quietly. I know there were times it was an uncontrolled, almost audible deep breath. As I'd catch myself lusting deeply. 

But that moment. The way your hair laid. The look on your face. The light beard. And... just you.

I added then:

I think I referred to it as ""the Disney prince hair"" to my cousin. And never did spells and curses sound so appealing just to have you kiss me and break it. 

He replied:

Lol you should have been a romance novelist

"She canceled before first date. Benefit of the doubt or move on? This girl matched with me on a dating app last Friday. I responded to her message, and she got back to me Saturday night where I suggested we grab dinner. She said she'd love to, but couldn't do the initial time I suggested because she said the week is kind of tough for her to make plans (which was totally fine with me because I usually don't like going out on weekdays anyway). She suggested the coming Saturday, but today (Thursday), she says she can't make it because her job is calling her to work at the time we agreed to on Saturday. I used to have a pretty demanding job that sometimes forced me work weekends and nights, so I told her I totally get what she's dealing with. 

Basically on the one hand: she's the one who suggested the time for the date originally, and she gave me a decent amount of notice before asking for a raincheck. On the other: she didn't immediately respond with a concrete alternative day/time, but maybe I should prompt that for her? She seems like someone I have a lot in common with based on her profile, and I'm especially willing to be patient about things like the reason she gave because the ambition/career drive is a quality I look for.

"Casual Dating A Guy BUT He's Acting Serious - Should I Ask if There's Hope for More? Met a guy on Hinge and we've been dating for a month now. We had our first date - dinner and ended up making out and having sex. We both talked a bit before hooking up that we both had only been in long term relationships previously and were trying out dating. We both said we weren't looking for something serious at this point and exploring dating. I stated that while I am open to having sex, I also wanted to get to know him be respected and like each other. He mentioned wanting to know the other person cared. We carried on - having dates every week, dinner, talking and having sex. The chemistry has been really great physically. I've been trying to take it slow but he texts me nearly every single day asking how I am and sharing how he's day is.  
When I ask him to adjust certain things he does it and remembers it going forward - ex: asking for cuddling after even though he said he didn't even do that for his relationships (7 years) - but each time he cuddles me after and asks if its good? He has been doing more and more things for me - paying every dinner, pouring my drinks, bringing me water when I cough, being more gentlemanly and always asking me out/initiating conversations. I find it very confusing and think it is definitely making me get feelings because of his attentiveness + the consistent good sex. I am really scared by this and have considered cutting him off many times now b/c of the feelings. I am not sure if I should bring up because we had previously  already mentioned just keeping things 'casual' even though he isn't acting casual. And mentioned that I want to get to know each other and not just have sex which he agreed and said he likes spending time with me but also does want to continue having sex --&gt; confusing statement still. 

  
Out of repressing these feelings - this week I said I'm not sure if he even likes me sometimes because he's a very reserved person. He said like can be interpreted many ways and hesitated. Finally he said he likes spending time with me and also 'the other thing we talked about' (having sex).

  
I am also unsure of bringing it up b/c  because we've only been seeing each other for 1 month - though I really don't want to get more hurt in the long run if I continue to develop feelings even though I don't even want to jump into a relationship either but just want to know that there CAN be a possibility sometime in the future if feelings continue...

  
tldr: Why does a guy who agreed to be casual start acting like a bf? Or is this just how men can compartmentalize feelings and if I should ask him if there is any potential to be open to more in the future after dating for 1 month? Should I let him know I am starting to get feelings and am considering ending things if he doesn't have any capacity for more in the future?",Thin_Vacation_813,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bmvvr/casual_dating_a_guy_but_hes_acting_serious_should/,1690517349.0,1.0

"How can I stop thinking about a guy? So I reconnected with an old friend a few months ago and I've had slight feelings for him, but not much where it's impacted me.

Ive learnt that I have issues with developing infatuation-type feelings for people not long after meeting them and I usually try not to follow them since I'm scared I'll overwhelm the other person.
But anyway, I've been coping fine with these feelings and haven't let them get in the way of our friendship.

I hung out with him yesterday, it wasn't a date or anything romantic - just 2 friends hanging out and nothing romantic happened which I wasn't expecting

After we left, I got home and went to bed and just woke up thinking about him a lot and it was hard to control. I don't want my feelings to ruin our friendship as I don't know what he thinks of me but at the same time I don't wanna be completely upfront about them to him as we've only just rekindled and I don't wanna scare him off.

"Have to stop doing my salsa classes... So I recently took up salsa dancing, I tried one class initially because I heard that a lot of women did it, but found myself enjoying it and over the last few weeks I just focused more on dancing rather than dating.

I got pretty acquainted with the people in the class, especially with these two women who are friends who have done these classes for longer than I have: we will call them A &amp; B.

A &amp; B would always try to talk to me during partnered lessons, and volunteered to dance with me at a salsa social event last month. 

I decided to ask A for her number and we met up the next day for a walk and talk, did our own dancing lesson in the park and made out. 

Next week A was friendlier to me but B was suddenly very distant and cold. The two were not talking to each other. I went to another lesson that week and when I tried to talk to B, she made a passive aggressive comment (can't remember it). 

The next week I went to class, I saw A &amp; B arguing over something before it started, then they kept distance from each other. I asked A what was wrong and she just said that ""B was just stirring drama over nothing"".

Later that week both A &amp; B suddenly went cold to me at class. A wasn't returning my texts. After class the teacher made a ""disclaimer"" about students dating each other and about ""being respectful"". The teacher then spoke to me after class to say that ""he didn't think the lessons were working out"".

I was confused and upset but before I left, another women, we'll call her C, approached me and let me know that A &amp; B talked about me to the other women and notified me that the same thing happened with another guy who had previously done these classes. 

Apparently that guy dated both A &amp; B and they had issues with each other but then ""took it out on the guy"" and discredited him.

What was going on here? I still have a few weeks left of these classes I paid for, do I keep going or just go to another school?",2guyshangingoutnaked,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bq0mk/have_to_stop_doing_my_salsa_classes/,1690527788.0,1.0
"Can I believe my boyfriend that he is fine with us waiting to have sex? I (20F) have been with my bf (21M) for 5 months. I'm a virgin and the idea of sex freaks me out for numerous reasons, so we haven't done anything yet. As weeks go by, I get more and more scared he will dump me because he's not getting laid. 

I tried to remedy this by deliberately getting blackout drunk before having sex last Saturday (I sneaked a tequilla bottle in my bag and drank it in one shot in the bathroom). He was very displeased with that though, refused to have sex and drove me home; he's been lowkey angry with me since. 

Today we had a conversation about it and I admitted I do not feel ready for sex rn, even though I will try to get ready in the next couple months. I made up a story about still being affected by purity culture, which sounded completely plausible since I come from an immigrant family (the real reasons paint me as insecure and somewhat insane, there is no way in hell he ever finds out about them). He reassured me, said that's not a problem and that even though he would obviously like to have sex with me he doesn't mind waiting some more until I feel ready. 

The problem is, I don't believe him. I can't shake the feeling he only says that bc that's what I want to hear and it is just as true as my purity culture sob story. He's a 21 year old healthy guy, he obviously has to have sexual needs that require satisfaction. It would be naive to expect him to hang around when he could go on Tinder and get a hot girl to sleep with him within an hour. I fear he's secretely resenting me for not putting out, that he'll end up dumping me if I don't become ready to have sex soon enough and the entire thing drives me even more anxious. How can I get proof that he's genuine? Everything I manage to think of could backfire tremendously (like for example getting a friend to try to seduce him).",throwaway12856439,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bpm4l/can_i_believe_my_boyfriend_that_he_is_fine_with/,1690526415.0,0.62

"Why do casual ‚Äúfun‚Äù partners have a different standard applied to them as opposed to relationships? I just saw a comment from a woman and it made me ponder this more.

As a guy, I think this applies for most. For HOOKUPS we often LOWER our standards.

This woman was commenting on a post where they were talking about height in dating. 

She said: 
‚ÄúI'm sad for him. Yes it's harder for short men. I know my gf and main FWB swipe left on every guy under 6 unless he's fall-off-your-chair handsome (and even then not less than 5'10). They are looking for casual sex though.‚Äù

So this seems to imply that women LOWER their standards but for RELATIONSHIP partners. This kind of tracks with what I‚Äôve read elsewhere but that was awhile ago, and could be false, idk.

Why is it the opposite between genders? Is that okay? Is casual fun inherently different than romantic fun?

"I fantasized about my husband‚Äôs best friend, and my subconsciousness punished me I‚Äôm so sorry about my long post, but I just needed to put this out somewhere. My husband (27m), his best friend (26m) and myself (25f) have just returned home from a children‚Äôs summer camp, where we worked as volunteers. It was the first time I brought them to the camp (I‚Äôve been a volunteer at that camp since I was a teenager), and they both did amazing as volunteers. The best friend was so nice to me all week, since I had a bigger responsibility this year, and I was very nervous about it. My husband was also very supportive, but the best friend (let‚Äôs call him Tony) was even more. Every day he told me and the other volunteers how great I was doing, and how cool I was for doing it. He stayed up late with me every night to keep me company, when I was working on the tasks for the next day. He build stuff for me that I needed and was just very kind. Tony and I are also really close, and I actually see him as my best male friend too. 
And btw he is also our neighbor, so we live right next to each other. Like Tony lives on the other side of the wall with his girlfriend.
Well, the other volunteers from the camp all loved Tony since he was so hardworking, kind and fun, and they told me that over and over. 

On the last day of the camp, I cuddled up next to my husband, and I started fantasizing about being with Tony. I thought about us having sex. I LOVE my husband and I DON‚ÄôT wanna be with anyone else but him, but in that moment, it just crossed my mind. 
I fantasized for maybe ten minutes, and then I fell asleep. 

And then I started dreaming.. 
I dreamed that we agreed on switching partners, so that I would be with Tony and my husband would be with Tony‚Äôs girlfriend. My husband and the girlfriend left the camp early to go home. Tony and I left the next day, and when we came home, I missed my husband so bad. I sneaked into my old apartment, and nobody was home. I looked around, and noticed that ALL of my belongings were already gone, and the place looked totally different. It looked like her. I was shocked as to how fast my husband just ‚Äúgot rid of me‚Äù, and I went to the bedroom. It was still our old bed. On the bed was my husband‚Äôs phone. I took it and looked at the chat between my husband and the girlfriend. Right then my husband entered the room, and got down next to me on the bed. There was no emotion in his face, and he just encouraged me to look his phone through if I needed to. I looked through their conversation, and they were already so flirty and sexual. They seemed so happy together, and I could suddenly see that they‚Äôve had the best, most passionate sex over and over. 
I broke down crying, and I cried so loudly. My husband didn‚Äôt react or comfort me, but just looked at me and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it is now‚Äù. I all of the sudden knew, that in the moment I agreed to the switch of partners, I was dead to him. 

I woke up, because my husband shook me (because I apparently was crying in my sleep also). I continued to cry after I woke up and I felt devastated. My husband comforted me and held me, and he asked what I had dreamed. I told him about the dream (I didn‚Äôt tell him about my fantasy the night before), and he just said over and over, that he would never want to be with anyone but me, and that it was just a stupid dream.

I‚Äôve been feeling icky all day, and I feel so bad about the fantasizing. I feel like I cheated or something. My husband has experienced cheating in past relationships, and he is VERY touchy about it. He has been clear since day one, that if I ever cheated, that‚Äôs it. This is of course SO fair, and the right mindset to have,  but now I just feel so scared because of those thoughts and that dream.

At the same time I feel so depressed about the dream, because it felt so real, and I just keep seeing my husband‚Äôs ignorance towards me, the empty apartment, and the images of him and the girlfriend having wild sex. I struggle a lot with jealousy and retroactive jealousy, so it hits so hard on me - and I also feel heartbroken thinking about my husband and I splitting up..

"What would you make of a person who wanted to marry you within a week or month of meeting you? So I met a woman on facebook, who was really very stunning. We both expressed in interest in  marriage when speaking on the phone, and in text. After meeting we really indulged in some serious physicality, and togetherness. Within a week or 2 she became extremely marriage crazy. Furiously attacking my ex wife, and her divorce settlement, and even exhibited jealousy toward my children., and planning wills and 50/50 a deed on the house. Attempts to discuss this and convey it's not normal and unwanted fall on deaf ears and continue to display more of the same. She is extremely sexually ingratiating and madly in love.

"She mentioned swinging I‚Äôm seeing a girl who is a fair bit younger than me and I‚Äôm her first serious partner. She says that I have ‚Äúsexually blown her mind‚Äù and now she is keen to try loads of new stuff she has never done before with me. Anyway, previously we had both discussed that we were monogamous and we joked about not relating at all to the multiple partners / polyamory thing that‚Äôs popular at the moment.

We were doing a quiz asking each other sexual questions, she answered no to everything to do with threesomes / watching other couples / open relationships etc. But then it got to one that was would you try swinging and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd try it‚Äù which surprised me so I asked ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù and she said ‚Äúare you sure you‚Äôd want to be with just one person for the rest of your life?‚Äù to which I said well yeah and then it was just very awkward and she then looked worried and backtracked and was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm monogamous too‚Äù there was an awkward silence and I couldn‚Äôt really get her to elaborate.

Later on she apologized for scaring me and said ‚Äùtrust me I‚Äôm not poly‚Äù.

But now I feel like she changed what she said because she knew it wasn‚Äôt acceptable to me rather than just ‚Äúmisspoke‚Äù. But I also feel like if I keep prodding at it and probing I‚Äôll come off as insecure. How would you handle this?

"Incompatible finances, compatible everything else I (26F) just entered a new relationship and I‚Äôm staring to feel that our difference in finances will be our downfall.

He (27M) is working full-time and rents a decently sized apartment in our major US city. He can take care of his basic needs but doesn‚Äôt have much leftover to spend on dates, gifts, or sweet gestures. I make high 6-figures and have been increasing my income rapidly for the last two years. I own my townhouse and have a good sum left to put towards investments and savings after paying my bills.

Prior to entering this relationship, we had a discussion of what a perfect relationship would look like. I stressed that being taken care of is important to me, and while I do not need to rely on a man for support, I prefer it. He said something along similar lines of being a provider. 

Great, our relationship values align. We‚Äôre amazing together in bed. Our personalities mesh well. However, I have yet to see any action or ambition towards becoming a provider. He‚Äôs working on gaining more experience to work up the ladder at his company, but it could be years before he‚Äôs able to live comfortably (or what I would consider comfortable). 

I love flashy dates, nice vacations, mutual spoiling and I can‚Äôt see myself doing that in the near future. I adore him and spending time getting closer‚Ä¶ but I have this terrible thought that I will soon resent our financial circumstances.

"What does it mean when a guy checks your LinkedIn multiple times? I'm asking for a friend. The situation is that she has been working on a school assignment with this guy. They had an almost 4 hour phone call to work on this assignment together. Shortly after she ended the call at the agreed time, she gets a notification that someone viewed her LinkedIn, which turned out to be the guy she was on a call with. 

As a bit of a background, I heard through the grapevine that this guy was dating a girl back in Oct 2022, but he has never brought up his girlfiend in conversation. My friend and this guy don't follow each other on social media, but they contact each other through a WhatsApp group chat. Her WhatsApp account initially didn't have a profile picture, but now she has a profile picture of herself. They both have worked on other assignments before and he had viewed her LinkedIn a few times before this incident. Each time, he views her LinkedIn after their phone call. He is also aware of my friend's career path through some small talk they've made over time. My friend and I find it odd that he viewed her LinkedIn multiple times.

"How much honesty is too much when you're down bad ? First post here so sorry if it doesn't follow the rules. 

Thing is: I have only dated two people in my life. Both of which were asexual, which is fine, but I discovered that I am REALLY NOT ace. Like, at all.

And though my last relationship ended more than a year ago, I came to realise over time that this was toxic as hell (never actually aknowledging that we were dating, manipulation my emotions a bit...). 


So that brings me to my current situation. I tend to associate relationships with the absence of sexual interactions, which I know is false, but I've been kinda conditionned to think like that.


I DO NOT CARE about love or dating for now. I just want as much sex as possible, to catch up the years I ""wasted"". I want to make it clear that I don't feel pressured in any way to have sex, it's just something that is super enjoyable for me. Unlike some people, I believe hookups can be meaningful and I want to profit of my youth to live a lot of experiences. Settling down can wait.

I currently have one fwb, whom I plan on keeping having intercourse with, but for diversity's sake I'd like to find more people who are dtf. (Again, this is not polyamory, no feelings are involved)

Which brings me to my title: how honest should I be with people about wanting sex without throwing away my chances. Because I value clear communication and being on the same page, but I don't seem to find people who share my needs. Does it turn off people to say you're horny and just wanna get to business ? Do I have to present it in a particular way ? 


TLDR: I'm horny and I wonder what I could improve",WorkedMage,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bg8kq/how_much_honesty_is_too_much_when_youre_down_bad/,1690498554.0,1.0
"Scared about dating as a wheelchair user M17 So I use a wheelchair. I'm ambulatory in the sense that I can walk a few steps and stand for a few seconds with crutches or walker, so I use wheelchair for everything not inside my house and even in there as well.

I can't go to a lot of places typical for dates and have to plan everything in advance and make sure where we go would be accessible. I'm also worried that they might find it to hard emotionally to be with someone in a wheelchair with the comments and everything.

"What is a generally accepted time frame to go on initial dates (1-3)? I (29M) went on a first date/grab a drink with a girl (25F) a week ago. We had fun and had good conversation for around 2 hours before she had to leave. At the end, she mentioned that food would be the plan for our next meetup, so I took that as a good sign.

Since then, she has been very low contact, whereas before our meetup, she was relatively easy to text with. Now, it is maybe 1 text every other day. I‚Äôm not stupid and I know what this means. Its happened to me before. I realize that people have lives outside of the person they‚Äôve only met once, but when I can see them active on social media, I mean come on, are we that childish?

"Me (30M) and GF (30F) broke up. Now seeing 31F). TL;DR: Honestly didn't think I'd come here for advice but my mind is twisted and I don't know how to act on this.

Me and my gf broke up after 5 years. I don't really want to go into detail about her because this isn't about her.

I met this girl through work. We rarely see each other at work and we both like to keep it that way just so there isn't any complications. We hung out a couple times outside of work. 1st was dinner and 2nd was an activity day and from what I assume, she loved it. It was a perfect day. And she wants to hang out again.

Throughout us talking for the past month or so, we would both get to know each other. In our conversations, I would drop the first flirting hint and she dropped one immediately back at me. She compliments my eyes and my work attire and I told her she's gorgeous no matter what she's wearing. Then she told me I made her blush.

Seems like every convo we have, we're laughing and having a good time. She asks me all these questions about my life. Interests family hobbies things like that. Go into detail about it. Most people wouldn't really want to know about. We seem to have a lot in common as well as far as personal goals. Love for animals. Same taste in music. We were talking about movies and Barbie (don't ask why) but then she says. I can be Ken and she'll be Barbie. Stupid I know but It's just a vibe when I hang out with her.

She has a daughter and I'm not deterred by that. I'm usually good with kids. And I've showed I'm interested in knowing more about her daughter and taking her up on her offer of having my niece and her daughter hang out.

When we last hung out. I walked her to her car and told her how I felt. That I'm attracted to her. I didn't really ask her for her feelings and she didn't give them out either. I hugged her. We held each others hands and then she came in and hugged me one more time. 

Idk if she's not attracted to me or just using me for attention to go out and do things and be spontaneous or if she's nervous about telling me. She has told me I make her nervous when she's around me. But when we do hang out it doesn't seem that way. I'm more of the nervous one.

"My BF passes gas a lot and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up. Hey everybody! This is my first post here. I have a question and need to vent a little I think. I (black 30f) have been dating a wonderful guy (white33m) for about 2 months now. It‚Äôs my first ever relationship. He‚Äôs a wonderful guy! Clever, kind, funny and so gentle. I enjoy being with him so much and love almost everything he does with me. But there is one problem that‚Äôs been bothering me. He often passes gas when we are together. It‚Äôs the silent but deadly type. It‚Äôs not on every date, about 60%, but it‚Äôs awful. The worst part is that he gives no reaction. No apology or ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù or rolling down the windows. The first time we were at a show and cuddled up together and I kept getting this awful smell and I didn‚Äôt want to believe it was him because would you really just let it lose for an hour while snuggled up with your girlfriend? Recently I met some of his friends for the first time and he kept on doing it while we were all driving to a show. Some of them were so bad and no one said anything and I‚Äôm just screaming inside and trying to smell my hairspray to get some relief. 

I‚Äôm not saying that I want him to stop passing gas. It‚Äôs a normal bodily function and my own are deadly as well. But the complete lack of acknowledgment is really bothering me. What is up with this? I worry that it‚Äôs a medical condition so I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. But I personally find it massively disrespectful. There are times you can hold gas in, but if you can‚Äôt then aren‚Äôt you supposed to say ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù at the very least? I haven‚Äôt done it around him yet but I excuse myself every time I burp in his presence, and they‚Äôre little baby burps too. Like roll down the windows if we‚Äôre in the car, or go off a few steps while we are standing somewhere (we were in line to pay for something at the mall and I just had to pretend to browse to get away from the smell multiple times). If we‚Äôre cuddled up then say something and push me away, don‚Äôt hold me closer as you poison my air. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my mother about it and our family therapist, but they both have the same racial and cultural background as me and are from an older generation. In my family we can‚Äôt even say the normal f word for passing gas, it‚Äôs considered vulgar and impolite. They find it completely disrespectful but I can‚Äôt tell if what we think is in line with current societal norms. I might be old fashioned or just overly sensitive. This is all so new to me and I‚Äôm an anxious autistic so I have no idea how to address this. My anxiety is going to absurd lengths like wondering if he has no sense of smell (I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever commented on my perfume and I try to wear different ones. I don‚Äôt care but I noticed) or has an embarrassing medical condition that his friends know about so they avoid bringing it up. Does anyone have any advice?

It‚Äôs a place where they don‚Äôt have to fret over the ‚Äòbig reveal‚Äô and where they could meet people who understand their condition. Stepping into the platform was a bit intimidating at first, but the supportive community genuinely eased my anxieties.

It was during this period that I crossed paths with Jenna, and she is my forth date.

Jenna had an effusive sparkle in her eyes - something that could lift anyone‚Äôs spirits. Our conversations were intriguing and emotive, and our first three dates had flown by effortlessly, filled with laughter, shared secrets, and a sense of familiarity.

For our fourth date, we decided on something we hadn‚Äôt attempted before - a hiking trip to a nearby nature reserve. The decision sprung from a shared longing for the tranquil outdoors, a break from our city-bound routines - a little adventure, if you will.

The day started with a hearty breakfast at a charming caf√©, complete with lively chatter and infectious laughter. Following which, we embarked on our journey towards the nature reserve, the butterflies in our stomachs hinting at the adventure that awaited us.

The thing about hiking is that it‚Äôs a struggle wrapped in magnificent views. We huffed and puffed, and laughed at our shared struggle. Together we traversed through thick trees and muddy terrains, with the only sounds being our footsteps, our hearty laughter, and the hymn of nature around us.

Near the top of the trail, we found a secluded spot overlooking the picturesque scenery beneath us. The place was quiet, serene, with only our soft breaths disturbing the peace. Sitting there, she opened up about her experiences with herpes - the fear, the anger, the acceptance, and finally, the understanding that it did not define her. I admired her strength and reciprocated with my own tale of reckoning.

What made this date different was not the stunning vistas or the adrenaline-rush from the hike, but the raw emotions and shared vulnerability. It was a firm reassurance that this platform had achieved its goal: to connect, to resonate, and to provide companionship beyond the stigma of herpes.

We walked back when dusk fell, the lulling voices of nature guiding our path. That night, surrounded by desolate beauty, we grew closer in understanding and empathy.

The experience that unfolded that night only strengthened our bond, highlighting the importance of understanding, empathy, and genuine acceptance beyond the imperfections. It taught me that love and intimacy transcend physical conditions, and what truly matters is the emotional connection between two people.",N111ko_for_dating,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15biwxx/my_fourth_dateabout_my_dating_experience_on_a/,1690505627.0,1.0
"Should I (male, 23) give her more time, or is it just her excuse for not knowing how to tell me that she doesnt like me?

Advice Hey so I work at my uncles pizzaria and there‚Äôs this really cute girl that works there. I don‚Äôt see her often because she usually works nights and I usually work mornings. However occasionally I do see her. Sunday is her last day for the season as she goes back to school. I really want to ask her out on a date but am extremely nervous. As I said I haven‚Äôt seen her many times but when we do we talk a lot and even sometimes banter. I cannot tell if she likes me. She goes go to school in a different state but I‚Äôm thinking maybe I‚Äôll be able to go on a date with her before she leaves. I feel awkward since I am the bosses nephew and don‚Äôt want to make her feel uncomfortable at her work place. She‚Äôs also 19 and I‚Äôm 25. And I‚Äôve never been on a date with a girl younger than me. Is this a problem in your opinion? It‚Äôs just that this girl really caught my eye. I was thinking of approaching her and saying something like hey I know it‚Äôs your last day would you want to grab some dinner before you go back to school?

"Broke Birthday Ideas for my Boyfriend of 1 Year? Hello all! I‚Äôm a bit embarrassed to be putting myself out there like this, but if it means I can get some inspiration for gift/activity of ideas for my significant other, then I‚Äôm all for it. It‚Äôs my boyfriends 29th  birthday in a few days, and we are going through a rough patch right now (more on that in a minute). Basically we‚Äôre flat broke, and I want to make his birthday as special as I can on a limited budget. I know he will be more than happy just to spend the day with me, but I also know from lurking on the site that Reddit can be a gold mine for ideas, especially for situations like this!

A little bit of backstory, for those interested: I met my boyfriend about a year ago. I had ended an abusive relationship about a year prior that was very toxic and unhealthy, and was apprehensive about going back into the dating scene. However, this guy really charmed the socks off me from the start, and while we took it slow in the beginning, he has really gone the distance to show me what being treated with respect and care feels like. Basically, without wanting to go on a spiel or be cheesy, he shows me what being special feels like, and I love to show it back in any big or little way that I can. For my birthday last year, he took me out to dinner, and got me a nice outfit, and a beautiful necklace. And a lovely card with a heartfelt note penned inside. It‚Äôs been years since I did anything special for my birthday, and I think he inferred as much, so he really went all out for me and the whole gesture just meant so much to me. Fast forward a few months and we‚Äôve hit a rough patch, and by that I mean we‚Äôre staying in his car right now, and working odd jobs to get by until we find something more stable. So the Tres Leches cake I wanted to make for him, and the other more expensive gift ideas, will have to wait until next year. 

I want to make it perfectly clear that I am under no pressure or obligation from him to buy or do something for his birthday, and when I asked if there was any activity he had in mind for the day, he simply wanted to spend the day with me. This is my own desire to have a special day for him, for the reasons I described above. So, does anyone have any creative budget gift or activity ideas? I was was thinking maybe a coupon book, you know for ‚Äúfree backrubs‚Äù or ‚Äúhead whenever you want‚Äù but A) it‚Äôs really hard to give a backrub in the car and B) the second idea is already something that‚Äôs taken care of regularly, so it seems kind of lame to give coupons for it‚Ä¶ 

Anyway, I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Thanks very much in advance if you took the time to read and comment! I know I‚Äôll be able to make him smile no matter what. üôÇ",rosalie_vellaveros,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bi12c/broke_birthday_ideas_for_my_boyfriend_of_1_year/,1690503169.0,1.0
"My best friend got together with my ex and hid it from me for 7 months. I dont know if this is the right place to post this and im sorry if it isnt.




I have been friends with this girl for 7 years. We have a great friendship, i opened up to her, we went on vacantions together, shared personal information and so on.   

I had a long distance relationship with a guy which she knew of, it was a healthy relationship id say but we broke up because life got in the way. After a few months, he messaged my best friend asking for support which i found weird as hell. I did tell her i wasnt comfortable with her offering him support and i respectfully asked her not to talk to him (bear in mind that i didnt force her, i only communicated how it made me feel) because he has friends he can go to for support and his family. I thought it was weird to ask for support from my best friend but okay. She did end up replying to him and she told me she felt bad for him but she told me she wasnt going to talk to him anymore in order to respect me. Fast forward to today, she confessed to me that she kept talking to him and that they got close and then got together (on the 1st of january). At the time when she started speaking to him, she was in a relationship and she lied to me saying that she broke up with her ex-boyfriend in february when they actually split in early december.

I want to add the fact that i do not have any feelings for my ex and it has nothing to do with him, but with her. I am in no shape or form jealous but i feel disgusted by what she did.

"My unexpectedly casual fling with Mrs. Right I am (21m), and she is (19f). For context, I met this girl on Tinder a week prior, and this was our first time meeting. I pulled up to her house, and I grabbed the door of my passenger seat for her as we greeted each other. We proceeded to my friend's place for a kickback. After a little bit of icebreakers and a couple drinks (she doesn't drink), we sat down with my friends and played some games for a while. Slowly, the party died down, and my friend who owns the house headed to bed while she and I watched some random ass movie. At this point, I want to mention that she said she didn't want to have sex on a first date, to which I replied, That's completely fine. What was soon to ensue was the complete opposite of that. What started as me lying on her stomach soon turned into me putting my hand around her throat and kissing her lips. We ended up making out, and although I'm not the best kisser, I managed to keep up the heat and then trail off to kiss down her neck to her collar bone. From there, I continued the foreplay and soon got the okay to slide my fingers inside. After a bit of clitoral play and some added pressure from inside, she came. At this point, I was done, honestly. I respected what she said before, but then she hit me with ""I want you inside me""! I was surprised but cautious still. I proceeded to ask her two more times just to make sure she was sure this was something she really wanted. She responded with a breathy ""yes"". So I proceeded to pull out my cock, and I could see a surprised look on her face as she looked at it. At this point, this beautiful girl has me absolutely falling for her, and not just because of the situation I am currently in but because everything about her, from her personality to her looks, is so dorky and hot at the same time. I slid inside, and this was quite an experience because I've never felt such wetness before. Although I hadn't gone all the way in, I could see her eyes roll back through a slit in between her eyelids. After about 30 minutes, she was worn out, and I hadn't finished, although it felt amazing. She asked if there was something wrong, and I explained that it takes me a while to finish, and she was slightly upset that she couldn't return the favor. I assured her that she felt great and that it was just me. I must have flicked a switch because she was ready to go again, and she decided to take control by getting on top. After another 20‚Äì30 minutes of hot breath and sweat, I finished inside her. This was a first-time experience for me, so I was just more attracted at this point. After a while of just kissing while she sat on top, we cleaned up and laid down for the night.
~
A day later, after some texting about what we wanted in life and other things of that nature, we decided to hang out at my place and play board games with some music in the background. She also mentioned that she didn't just want to have sex when she came over, and I agreed. After hanging out for a while and talking a little bit more about our past relationships, We realized that we were very similar. I felt like we were connecting way more than we already had the previous night. After we ate, we crawled into bed. Once again, we started to make out, and I continued to please her with foreplay. After that, she once again asked for it, and when she did, I immediately made her confirm rather than jump on the opportunity. She replied, ""Give me that dick"". I could tell this was more aggressive than last time, so I told her to turn and bend over. She did it immediately after I commanded it, with no fuss. It was almost like she knew that I love when women are submissive. We went at it for 30 minutes, and she told me she was tired and couldn't take it any longer. I kissed her forehead and said that it was fine and that I appreciated her effort. We laid down for about an hour, and she started to grind on me. It only took me a couple seconds to get back up to full size, and she immediately Put it back in and pushed back against me as I stroked deep. Soon after, I was filling her up. This was just an amazing feeling. We cleaned up, and in the morning she went to work.
~
We texted through the following day, and her responses started to change. I noticed something was wrong, and I asked her, but she just said it was nothing. Obviously, this meant that it was something. I just didn't want to pry and ruin our relationship. Soon after, I was faced with a response to my question, ""Do you still want to hang out?"" Her response was ""Idk."" I was so hurt that I blocked her and began writing the perfect message to convey my feelings to her. Although I was putting my pride at risk, I had felt that I loved this woman more than my previous 3-year relationship. We had shared that we wanted kids together and to get married. It all just stopped so suddenly, and I needed to explain myself even if she didn't care because it was for me, honestly.

"""Goes to therapy"" is an absurd prerequisite for dating On dating apps, I come across a lot of people who write that they're only looking for matches with people who go to therapy. This is absurd to me.They're assuming that everyone is like them: that they were messed up and confused until they went to therapy, and now they're better. 

But some people aren't any more messed up without therapy than other people are with therapy. For some people, therapy (or at least whatever therapy they have access to) isn't helpful.

Most importantly, NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD THERAPY. Geez.

"How should I (24M) approach DM‚Äôing this girl (23F) I‚Äôm interested in? Hi everyone,

After the most difficult past year of my life, I‚Äôve finally come to terms (and worked through) all that has happened, and am moving forward. This includes revisiting my (admittedly dry) dating live that I stepped away from. Before, I was in a download/delete cycle, but told myself that whenever I revisit dating, I‚Äôd try and do it off the apps. Either in person or dming people I‚Äôve been interested in for a while. Granted this last one is still via app, but I suppose different because it seems more ‚Äúreal‚Äù (idk how to describe it lol).

Anyways, there‚Äôs this girl I followed on IG earlier this year in March. Same hometown, she‚Äôs friends with a really close cousin (that‚Äôs like a sister), have other mutuals, live in same city now, went to same place for undergrad, and from similar diaspora communities. I think she‚Äôs really cute and finally have the courage to initiate things. However, she doesn‚Äôt post photos/stories too often. What she posts on her stories isn‚Äôt really conducive (in my opinion) to starting a convo; related to some company she works/associates with and I never knew how to try and engage with it (ie, don‚Äôt want to shoehorn into shitty conversation lol). 

Until earlier this week, she posted a story of food she was eating with a friend and I liked the story. Things are getting pretty serious (jk haha). I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd continue from here? Besides liking/trying to respond to such stories that aren‚Äôt related to that one company (because idk wtf I‚Äôd say). Some people have suggested messaging her just saying hey (others said to say I was thinking about her, but that‚Äôs just weird imo). I have a tendency to overthink + an autistic, so a lethal combo lmao. What do y‚Äôall think? She always views my stories and liked my photo that I uploaded a few weeks ago.

"The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband... For purposes of this story, my ex's name is Hannah, her husband is Jeremy and her sister is Amanda (all fake names).
Hannah and I started dating in our senior year of high school. It was great, but lasted about 6 months and ended things about a month before graduation. We kept in scarce contact until about the end of the year when I moved out of state. We didn't talk at all for a couple of years but I knew she had started dating and ultimately married another guy from my facebook feed. When I moved back to our home state, I randomly got a message from Hannah asking if I still liked the same type of stuff. I said I did, and she replied that she knew a girl, Amanda, that ""would be perfect for me"" and offered to go on a double date. I said ok and then she said that it is her sister-in-law. I feel incredibly awkward at this point (I was 21 and not the best in awkward situations) because I already agreed but would rather not go out with her SIL, I had thought it was going to be a friend or something.
So the day of the date comes and I meet Jeremy, Hannah, and Amanda to go see some Christmas lights. Jeremy and Hannah walk off and I'm left alone with Amanda which was the ""best"" part of the date, only because that's when I was the least awkward, but they come back and spend most of the date with Amanda and I. It wasn't a great date by any means (mostly due to me). I felt like I couldn't talk to Amanda with them there. Jeremy and I didn't have anything in common that I could glean from the conversations that I had heard whilst on the date, and I felt like I couldn't talk with Hannah (even though I had no feelings for her at this point, being married and all. I just got along with her best) because that would probably just upset Jeremy and Amanda. Then Hannah and Jeremy offer for everyone to come back to their place for hot chocolate any more conversation, and me being me, agree to go over. More awkwardness ensues and after a bit, I say I better get going and leave for home and finally get to unwind from that shitstorm of awkwardness that just engulfed me those last few hours.
So, yeah, that's the story of how I went on a blind double-date with my ex's SIL, my ex, and her husband (and in case it isn't clear; husband and SIL are siblings).
P.S. During the time we were dating, I knew that Hannah's parents were divorced and she lived with her mom 100%. What I didn't know until after the date was that Jeremy had also lived with a single parent (his dad) and that Hannah and Jeremy's parents married each other (after Hannah and Jeremy were married, not before).
P.P.S. So I guess, technically, I should have titled this: The time I went on a blind double date with my ex's SIL/step-sister, my ex, and her husband/step-brother.

"How Can I Stop Dating App Addiction? I never realized I was addicted to dating apps until I saw a pattern among my friends as well as myself. I need to check my messages every day, a few times a day at least.

When I meet people in person from the dating app, I always keep thinking there is someone else better and I usually find excuses to not want to see that other person again...or vice versa as it happens to me.

If things do go well with someone I meet from a dating app I still feel the need to go on the dating apps and respond to or send new notes to other people.

I noticed in the last 20 years I have bounced around from one dating app to another on and off over a period of those years.  Even if I am with someone in a decent relationship I keep thinking there is something more, it scares me if they want to get too serious, because I seem to want my freedom, but also want to be with someone else at the same time.

"Tinder date of 3 months - need advice Hey there reddit! 

So I need some advice, sorry in advance for the long post.

Like I never did the dating thing properly before and I don't really know the dos and donts, especially if it comes to American dating habits. 

So a little background. We matched about 3 months ago on Tinder. He (33/Texan) and me (33f/German).

Apparently being Texan is a big thing because with it comes a lot of old school habits like: a girl should never touch a bill or a door handle... Well I'm german, I feel bad if he's paying for it all the time, but love the door handle thing. Anyway that's not the point, even If it counts into it a little. 

Back to the story:

So we went on our first date: first going for a walk with my dog, going to dinner after and having 2/3  drinks. It was amazing we linked really well and I took him back to mine. Well things got a little heated, he ate me out like a starved man and left with the words ""I'm trying to be good right now"". 

Well that was that. Things took a sexual turn ever since, we go still on dates on Saturdays usually but I do stop by for a night of sex thru the week usually. The sex is great, he's not what I'm going for usually, which is new to me but I like it and he's blowing my mind sexually. Also I'm not the cuddly type usually but turns out I can be a snuggle monster if treated right.

So we do cutesy shit, like he cooks, we do the bathing together relax thing, I get t shirts, he gets panties left behind, period sex, it's all very relationshippy to me. But we never actually talked about where this is supposed to go. I mean we seem to be exclusive, he fucking adores my body, sex is amazing etc. All great. But I don't know him well enough to go down the relationship path. You know what I mean ? Like if we together it's great there are no sec. thoughts but when I'm back out of the bubble it's like, hmm who am I and what is this?

So I need advice about dating habits and if this is me sliding right into a relationship I'm not yet ready for. Or if I'm overthinking shit again and should just go with the flow and it will present itself at some point.

"Is this ""ghosting""/rude? Hi all - sort of a silly question of semantics around the definition of ghosting - bear with me:

\- Say you go on three dates with someone - nothing happens beyond a polite kiss goodbye after date 2 and 3

\- They leave town for a week for work

\- When they get back, YOU leave town for a week for vacation

\- When you get back in to town, you reach out to them to make plans.  They respond that ""it's really busy this week but lets reconnect next week""

\- They do not reach out the next week to reconnect, and you don't hear from them again.  You also don't reach out again because you already did once, and it seems like they won't at this point and are just not interested.  Oh well!  You move on.

In either case, settle a debate - is this being ""ghosted""?  Or this is just a casual dating relationship that naturally faded out?

"How to navigate an early relationship if I want a commitment? We've been dating a month and a half now. Things have been great, aside from this weekend (I will get to that below)... We started off strong, though he started off lying to me about just getting out of something with his ex. She started messaging me the first week of us dating (I guess she saw that he and I were friends on IG)... Basically, he had just paid her rent (she claimed they lived together and she wanted him off her lease but he said he is not on her lease and I believe him) and he just bought her a sofa. She also sent me screenshots of another girl saying he was ""playing house with her 2 months ago"" ... based on that, I already knew the ex's timeline didn't add up (they just met this past January and he and I started dating in June, so how was he living with her and playing house with someone in April...) Either way, all of the drama made me very skeptical and even when things would be going well, I would express my doubt to him. For instance, I brought up to him late one night after a night out that I think he's dishonest because he's always at my place but has NEVER invited me over his. In that same moment, he told me to get up and get dressed. He took me to where he lived, with his grandmother, which reassured me. We spend a lot of time together (at least 5 days a week and he sleeps over). This past weekend wasn't good for us, though. Kind of a bump in the road... we went out to bars with his friends and kind of did not get along. Definitely a mixture of drinking and probably overdoing the festivities. 

On Sunday I ended up telling him I wanted to take a step back because the weekend left me with a terrible feeling-- Friday, I got drunk and argued with him and when he walked away in anger to calm down, it alarmed me so drunk me thought it was a good idea to call his ex and ask if his behavior was normal. I hung up before she answered and apologized to her for calling. I told him I called her and he was upset but we didn't dwell on it. Saturday, we had an outing at the park and had a wonderful time, then he wanted to go meet his friends at a bar. We went and he was basically limiting my drinks-- understandably so because I acted a fool the night before. I had a bit of an attitude so he went to the bar to get me a glass of sparkling wine with his friend, who was getting his date a drink. This guy was trying to flirt with me when he came back and he got upset with me and basically ignored me for the next 30 minutes. Really rubbed me the wrong way. Sunday morning when we woke up, I just thought it was too much and I wanted to spend my day alone. He insisted he come with me to run errands though, so we stayed together. Later on while we were watching a movie, he just seemed so distant. I was relieved when he had to go pick up his friend. That's when I told him we should distance ourselves. He assured me he wanted this and was afraid of losing this and wasnt going anywhere so I said, okay no need for the distance, but he agreed two days would do us some good. We saw each other again yesterday and just watched a movie, and I was surprised when he wanted to leave after because he usually stays the night. When he left I asked him where his head was and he said nothing has changed and that we're just getting past a bad weekend. 

I would really like some advice on how to proceed in a healthy manner. I really like this guy and I want him to want to commit. On Sunday we were watching a movie and he said something like ""a man knows within the first week if he wants to commit to someone.""

Not that I wouldn‚Äôt trust a partner, but you really never know what could happen in the future and I feel It is my responsibility to protect whatever I‚Äôd be inheriting from my parent‚Äôs hard work.

"I'm in love with my ex, and I love my boyfriend, but I'm not in love with him. This is really long because there's a lot to explain so I'm really sorry. 
For the sake of privacy and having no confusion, we'll call my ex salad and my boyfriend forklift. Random names that correspond with them.

Backstory on my ex:
We met when I started working at a restaurant. He was the salad/fry cook, and I started as a dishwasher. I always found him to be pretty cute, but didn't really have any feelings for him or at least didn't realize that I did, until I worked my first double. We have a thing that he does with jar lids. He can fold them in half by squeezing them in one hand. Hard-core grip strength. And then I would unfold them, make them look nice again. He does this, and I get the idea to turn it into a heart shape. He had to help me with this. I wrote inside, something like ""you're doing great"", just something positive. For a while, he had it hanging on the fridge in his station. We became friends on Facebook, started talking more. And on mother's day in 2022, confessed feelings for each other over text while at work. This was the beginning of something that would tear me into shreds later on. We started seeing each other, sleeping together. But kept it ""private"", it was secret. No one could know. He didn't have a girlfriend or anything, but we worked together and didn't want coworkers in our business. However, no one knew that he was seeing ANYONE. He literally kept it entirely secret. Fast forward to July. He had given me a key to his apartment, I had face wash and moisturizer in his showers, lingerie in his bedroom. It was my second home. We had a mutual coworker who had just quit, we'll call her airplane. Airplane was pretty and skinny, but she was quirky and annoying. She confided in me that she had feelings for Matt. Me, being stupidly loyal, told her I didn't think he was seeing anyone. Then they start talking. She sends me screenshots all the time of their conversations, asking if I think he likes her. I'm always very vague but it seemed perfectly friendly at first. Until it wasn't. Until he was flirting. He tried to say he was just being friendly, but it sunk me. In late july, they both went offline at the same time and stayed offline. This was unusual because salad was pretty active on Facebook and I knew he wasn't at work. So I shoot airplane a text, asking how she's doing. She tells me she's hanging out and cuddling with salad. And then that he kissed her. I text salad and tell him I'll be getting my things the next day, and I don't want to talk to him again. However, we were coworkers. So we tried to be friends and make nice. I was also head over heels for him. He was the first person I'd been able to commit to in years. We end up hooking up again. But he's still not ready for a commitment or something. So we argue, and I block him. Now enters my current boyfriend. 

Boyfriend's backstory:
He is my best friend's boyfriend's brother. That's how we met. I always thought he was cute. In semptember, he gets drunk and admits he has feelings for me. I say I wouldn't mind talking. We talk for a bit and start dating. Things were going great for about a month, until he gets drunk and yells he doesn't love me and never could. We break up, he apologizes, we get back together. This went on for a couple more months, alcohol always being the source of our problems. We've been off and on since, and we're currently on. I do love him, but he doesn't make me feel the way salad does. Ever. Sex is boring with him, whereas salad does lots of different things to stimulate me. I still talk to salad, we slept together right before forklift and I got back together. I told forklift he'd have to cut way down on the drinking if this was gonna work. It seems like he has, but he still drinks beer like water. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not being fair to Forklift because I can never truly love him the way I love Salad. But I don't think Salad will ever want anything more than the occasional hookup from me. Does anyone have advice? 


Other info that may be relevant: 
Salad is 8 years older than me. 
Forklift is 6 years older than me. 
I am of legal age, and I have a great relationship with my father, just like older guys.

"One heartbreak after another 6 months with my first partner were some of the greatest and happiest moments of my life. We broke up 7 months ago and I was absolutely shattered to the core. Now, I 21M met this other person 21F who I was interested in for around a month. Turns she was really into me and she showed a lot of interest in me which I‚Äôve never felt before. I was later quite addicted to this feeling of being wanted that I made a shitty decision which you‚Äôll read in a moment. After a great first date at an ice rink, she made it clear that all she wanted was a casual relationship, nothing with a future possibility of something long term as she was an international student. I was once again heartbroken, so I called it off. Quite convincingly too. A few hours later, I call back changing my mind while giving her shitty reasons like ‚ÄúI too want something casual‚Äù when all I wanted was the feeling of being wanted. This was the shitty decision which ultimately drove her away as she ended things a few days later. 

Although we‚Äôre still in touch, this girl doesn‚Äôt even show the same enthusiasm as she did before. In fact, she‚Äôs quite dry texting. The fact that I went back to her after making a strong choice, showed her I was desperate which ultimately ended things.

Now, I feel really devastated after this ordeal. All I want is to enjoy my summer with someone. I don‚Äôt want anything long term atm because I‚Äôm not mature enough for it yet and I just want something casual with some commitment because I‚Äôm going into my final year of university and I just want intimacy after being starved for so long.

"One of my best friends just found out her husband asked me out a few years ago and had a crush on me, now she's acting like she doesn't want to talk to me I have a friend group through my son's school (I'm a single mom). I consider these really close friends of mine and we hang out a lot and have dinner parties and movie night. I mentioned to them that I'd like to start dating again and what I'm looking for - I'm a single mom so dating has been really hard for me the last few years. One of my closest friends said her husband (let's call him John) knows tons of eligible bachelors at work. This guy John works at a big tech company (think Google, FB, Amazon) and is very well to do and so I liked the idea of meeting his friends. I was out to lunch with my female friend and asked her to ask her husband to try to set me up with some coworkers. We got to talking and I mentioned I would like to meet a guy like her husband, ""I missed the boat with him"". She asked what I meant and I told her John had asked me out a few years prior in a completely different setting and it wasn't the right time for dating back then and I turned him down. She immediately had a look of horror on her face like I had told her that her mother had died. She got quiet and just asked ""what?"". I told her that John and I had met through a volunteer organization a few years back and he made a pass at me and she asked ""why did you turn him down?"". She seemed upset all of the sudden. I tried to explain to her I wasn't really dating at the time and wasn't interested. Every since our chat my friend has been ignoring me, at least from what I can tell. I texted her asking if John can introduce me to some of his coworkers and she just texted back ""I don't think so"". I don't understand why this information was so difficult for her to process and what I did wrong. I've been single for a very long time and would love to start dating again, especially with some of the guys like her husband but she seems totally put off that her husband had asked me out a few years back.

"should I tell him how I feel? 
hi, i‚Äôve recently run into a situation with the guy I really like/am talking to (?) that I would like some advice on. 

I met this guy about a month before the end of my first year at college. He drove down from a city about an hour away to come visit me on campus. We really hit it off, we talked for hours, smoked, watched a movie, got takeout, and talked some more. He visited me again about two weeks later, before I left to go home for the summer. He took me out to dinner and we had another wonderful time together, we really connected and explored town/talked until the late hours of the night. We laughed about how we were shocked we met on Tinder and ended up connecting this much. He kissed me at the end, and said he‚Äôd like to stay in touch, he even offered to have me travel up to the summer camp he works at over the summer. 

We‚Äôve been texting and exchanging memes and stuff all summer, and I‚Äôve been so excited to see him again in the Fall, but we‚Äôre not official. 
Yesterday he called me to check in and chat, which was really nice. We laugh so easily with each other and seem to get each other really well. 
This is where the dilemma comes in. 
He told me his scholarship for his college in the city by mine wasn‚Äôt renewed, so he isn‚Äôt returning in the Fall. :( I was really sad, but I didn‚Äôt really show it outside of saying it was a bummer, which he apologized for but I assured him it wasn‚Äôt his fault. He said he may look at other colleges in the same state, but also mentioned another state as a possibility. 
I want to tell him I want to stay in touch with him regardless of where he ends up, and that I really like him and would love to see him again at some point, But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too much or not.

But what's bothering me is that I literally asked just for a 5 mins call and he can't even give it to me. I have busy time too where I can't open my phone and check socmed and I understand that we all have different way.. But I'm literally asking for bare minimum and he seems to be just cutting me off which is never happened to me like ever. He has a lot of time to play video games and read novel (which is I do the same thing too but at least I make time for him) He's my source of happiness and just hearing and seeing him for like 5 mins can make my day.. I just don't understand why even 5 mins is already feel like a chores to him. 

I kept confronting him like maybe he's messing around and just waiting for me to just give up and ask for break up and the last thing he said ""Don't be like this, don't think like this"" I keep asking him if he's cheating since how the hell would I know if he's far away from me?

I never see posts about guys who date women where they know they can do better, or women who feel horrible knowing their man could dump them at any time.I have always had girlfriends where people look at me like ""dude, that's who you're with? Come on man you're better than that"". I end up dumping them and it's nasty. I feel extremely alone, emasculated, and worthless because I can't find people who relate.

"Is two days too late to text a girl back? How does texting even work? Hello, good people of arr-dating. I'm back here for advice.

I (23M) ended up texting a girl (a few years older than me, F), who I think *might* like me back, over a work-related platform. She didn't immediately file a restraining order which I think is a good sign. Problem is, every time I look at the ensuing conversation, I get a different vibe from her:

&amp;#x200B;

Points for no:

* Our conversation is pretty impersonal for the most part, though I'm not sure how to quantify this.
* Her responses are pretty short and she's asked one question back so far. That was her one attempt to continue the conversation.
* We've exchanged a total of nine messages so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Points for yes:

* She texts back almost instantly. Every time. Even when I took half a day to text her back.
* Her responses are short but not dismissive. Seems to me that she's just a bad texter. As far as I can tell, English is also her second language, so that might be part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a pretty strong no to me. I've stopped bugging her.

However, I've been told it's common for some girls to not ask questions back and expect you to continue the conversation on your own. That's what our dynamic (which, I'll admit, is a strong word to use here) was in real life too. She's very quiet and I'm not. She hasn't gone past work-stuff, but I also never asked for fear of being weird. I've talked about my own life (once) instead and she never reciprocated. Again, strong ***no*** vibes, but people say this is par for the course.

I stopped talking to her because I figured she wasn't interested, and it's been about two days since, but I keep getting this nagging feeling that I'm seeing a rejection that isn't there. It's an old habit of mine. On the other hand, I don't want to be the guy that can't take hints. If she's not interested, I'll gladly leave her alone and drown my sorrows.

Anyway, I work a lot and I‚Äôm also a home body so my chances of finding someone naturally are practically nonexistent. Im also dumb enough to want to be In love and share life with a partner, and not looking for love makes me uneasy.

It‚Äôs not that I have issues getting matched with people. I‚Äôm a young female, successful and decently good looking. 

My experience so far:
Tinder - I‚Äôve had some kinda success with this app. I feel like more people are looking for hookups though.. my fuck girl days are over lol and I want more meaningful connections.

Coffee Meet Bagel- honestly this app is a hit or miss. I met my last long term partner on this app and we dated for almost 2 years before realizing we wouldn‚Äôt be compatible in the long run. Haven‚Äôt had any success after that, just a lot of men in committed relationships/open marriages looking for a 3rd (I‚Äôve also tried this, not really my thing).

Bumble- never had any success with bumble. It‚Äôs been a few years and I feel like the quality of people on bumble is directly related to where you live‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm a traveling nurse and sometimes live in the boonies while on assignment.

PoF- let be honest, when has this app EVER been quality? Maybe it‚Äôs changed over the years but I‚Äôm not hopeful.

Hinge- has turned into more of a fuckboy community over the years. I‚Äôve had minor success with this app.

I feel like this hits the big apps but anyone have any other recommendations?

I‚Äôm also also experimenting with my sexuality so, definitely open to less mainstream and more queer friendly options.",Neat-Ad2904,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b1wrr/dating_app_recommendations/,1690464464.0,1.0
"Not fully sure where people(women) my age tend to hang out.  For context I'm 28M. I live in SWFL. I've been rolling solo since for a whole now.  One of the biggest struggle I've had since moving here 7 years ago is the amount of older folk in the area vs  anyone who's somewhat close to my age.    I'm still just at a lost on where to I should be hanging out to have a better chance at stumbling across  those who seem my age.   I would say most the people are 45+. And most being around that retirement age.  I dont think I've had a proper random conversation  with anyone under the age of 40 so far this year(  work not included).  

 I am the introverted type who  doesnt always know what to do to open up more. I've never step foot into a crowded bar or club. As I struggle with loud music/lights/bumping into people and so I do ussally make a point to even try on like a friday or Saturday  night( work nights any way)   I do get sundays for free time but everywhere I kinda go is chill but always just filled with older folks. You know when I have the free time. 

Am I just being dumb about the situations?. I am on the spectrum  so I know  I can be pretty naive  about basic things at times. I just dont even know what people around my age are even doing or are into  that's around my age.   Find places where it mainly 20s and 30s flusters me.  I only seem to see children,teen,parents and older folks but cant seem to pick out people my age.   

  Just for context  meetup.com had over 10 active options for people 45+   the only active 20s,30s group is  a over an hour drive because it's for a different area altogether.  The closest mall that isnt dead is 45 mins, beaches alere an hour or 2 depending.  Semi rural

"My (19F) bf (22M) liked a tiktok video of a girl dancing provocatively right behind me Just like the title says, it's kind of wild to me how he did it. We were in his bedroom, he was sitting on his bed (behind me) scrolling on tiktok. I was busy putting away my stuff since I was going to sleep with him that night, and I heard the audio from the tiktok repeating from his phone. 

I'm quite familiar with the audio since I've seen girls posting their sexy dances with it, so I turned around to him and by this time he already scrolled away from it. I asked what video was he watching earlier, he hesitated so I scrolled up on his phone and I was right afterall. It was in fact a girl dancing sexily and guess what, he liked the tiktok. There goes the classic excuses of 'liking everything he sees' or the 'accidentally liked'.

I'm wondering if it really is a small matter since he asked me if I'm really mad over that small thing. But the more I think about how he literally liked the video while I was in the same room as him, right in front of his eyes, only facing away from him, the more miserable my mind gets.

That's not all, he lied about a lot of things after I went  through his phone (with permission since he told me his password confidently). And there's always nonsense explanation to each of it which I don't believe at all. Did I mention I found out that his Instagram is filled with girls that resembles his ex (a muslim) but only half naked on his homepage? There's like a hundred of them too. 

I'm starting to think I should leave since he and his family was pressuring me to get engaged with him while he's got all of these going on. I'm gonna confront him about all of these soon, but before I do I just wanted to know what do you guys think of these type of dudes anyways?

"How do I stop getting attached so easily Basically the title. I (23m) would like to develop meaningful platonic relationships with women but I find myself getting attached and catching feelings as soon as we get somewhat close. I then end up thinking they're ""the one"" and it's not healthy at all. It usually ends up ruining the friendship although I am very respectful of boundaries and try to communicate as healthily and respectfully as possible about mine and their feelings and what the relationship is. I eventually end up losing those feelings after we have communicated about the nature of the relationship. And I usually end up getting those feelings for someone else as soon as that happens and the cycle continues. I still remain friends with some women that this has happened with but not as close as I would like to be with them even platonically. I understand this isn't very healthy which is why I am asking for advice.

"How do I cope with being lonely? I've been single for a while now. My last relationship was long distance for a few years. We never saw each other and gave up at that point. But forget that context. I really just want someone to hang out with. I feel sad and I don't have anyone to give to, by no means do I need someone to ""fix me"" or validate me or help me overcome any insecurities cause I've done that all myself. But I just don't want to be alone when I get home anymore. I want someone to look forward to hanging out with, I've tried dating apps and getting out but it just leads to hookups and short term fwb type stuff. I don't know how to deal with this really, I'm in no way a romantic due to my inexperience and people honestly just find me really obnoxious. It's a front in a way but no one wants to actually get to know me and all the girls I've talked to are in relationships or taken by other guys with more experience. If there's one insecurity I have it's that, can't really help it though because if I try to come across as ""smooth"" I just think it sounds cringe and kind of creepy. I dunno what to do, I have so much love to give but no one wants it. Im having a lot of fun in life and I want someone to be a part of that with me. It's a weird spot because most single guys want relationships to ease their insecurity or make them happy in a way. I'm happy and I have a good life, Im not really insecure about anything in regards to my body or personality. It's kind of hard to understand and it's the one thing I just can't wrap my head around.

"Trying to meet this girl, but she is giving mixed signals I'm 25 male, had this breakup 6 months ago. Months ago I noticed this girl exchanging glances with me at the gym, but everytime we look at each other, she tends to look away. I think she is so so so attractive, but didn't felt ready to engage at friendship or anything else cause I was dealing with the breakup. Now I feel so much better and ready to try meet new people and she's top 1 in my mind right now, but we barely chit chat on elevator last week and take turns lifting. Few days after, in gym again, we saw each other while I was leaving and she was entering. I tried to look at her and say something but she pretend she didn't see me (we were very close). Now, when at gym, I avoid to look at her cause I don't want her to feel uncomfortable. But I really do think she is a shy person, and this could explain why she does look away sometimes, as when we did chat, she seemed at least interested. I'm confused cause I don't want to miss the chance to get to know her (for a friendship at least), but I don't want her to feel awkward as well and she is giving mixed signals (in my opinion).  
  
I personally don't think the gym it's the appropriate place to start flirting with someone, cause when I'm working out, I don't like to be bothered, so I don't bother her as well.

After a while of not seeing me, he parked his car down the street, physically got out, walked to the apartment complex, through the gate and was spying on my vehicle.

I really got a sense she liked me back or at a minimum as a friend but also maybe more. 
With the guy, I didn‚Äôt really have an opening like that, except for him saying where else he worked.  Also got a vibe from him too that it was mutual.

Another time it was a guy crush but I only saw him once a month.  I was feeling so shy too. So I talked a bit some lunch times and that was it.

And at the main job when it‚Äôs every day what do you do then when you see them every day even if it goes wrong?

I did date a couple of guys kinda at a work &amp; study place once &amp; sometimes it felt awkward if things ended?

I pretty much am going to explode and really want to have sex so bad so I think to myself fuck it Im asking her, and I say ""do you want to have sex?"" she looks down and replies softly ""i dont know"" I tell her I respect that and continue to makeout. I dont want to be pushy and ask again for sex so I eventually stop making out because I think its probably too soon for her.

"Opinions please‚Ä¶ Hi all,

So I met a girl a few weeks ago at a party and we hit it off straight away. Chemistry was all there and spent all night together. She insisted to get my number from me before she got into a taxi home.

Later I decide to follow up and ask her out. She ignored the request and replied with how late it was and getting home with it being light already.
I left this and she later replied again to say that she was busy all weekend and ‚Äòmaybe next week‚Äô

So I left it for half a day and then offered the Tuesday. 
I then get a reply saying she is not looking to date and her head isn‚Äôt in the right place but could still meet up sometime. The next day I was out in town and happened to see her with another guy‚Ä¶ I immediately knew what this looked like. 

A few days of us not talking, she offers to meet for a coffee on the weekend. I accept.
The next day I get another message asking if I wanted to join her to a party the day before the coffee. I also accept this and go with zero expectations.

This time it‚Äôs even better or so I thought‚Ä¶.
She admitted to me about her head being all over the place but a few weeks ago decided to date a guy from a dating app but realised she actually liked him after 3 dates. 
As the conversation progressed she leaned in to kiss me and we did.. mostly all night. Saying how good the chemistry is etc and she said she didn‚Äôt expect it to go this well with me. 

I explained my position of not wanting to be involved unless I date her and not after casual.(learnt my lessons)

Before she dropped me off (she didn‚Äôt drink at all)  - she said‚Ä¶ We can sleep together and it may or may not lead to us dating.
I said no to this but she insisted I think about it and she will think about her situation on dating.

She also decides coffee the next day isn‚Äôt such a good idea but her words ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a no like that it‚Äôs just I need to think‚Äù 
‚ÄúNot saying no in the future‚Äù

She goes cold with me the next day.
The following day I take a last ditch shot and ask to meet-up.
I am then greeted with a ‚Äúmy situation has changed and I am looking to date and see where it leads‚Äù (with the other guy).

I‚Äôve replied and said I understand and to take care. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a rebound or what. 

She then said ‚Äúwe have great chemistry and I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not something we can explore right now‚Äù.

Wtf?! 

I know the right thing is to move on and not look back but ffs the chemistry was off the charts. Anyone at both events commented that we either looked a couple or should be.

Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to let go of the idea. It sucks.

"Messaging turned sexual way too early, and I‚Äôm not interested anymore. This guy is weirding me out. Should I ghost or block cold turkey or should I fade slowly?

"Is he dating his baby mother or me after everything? 
I met someone at my first ever job. I‚Äôm 22 and he‚Äôs 33. He‚Äôs got a baby mum and two kids (7 and 3/4), he stays at their house together and states he sleeps on the sofa.

He never mentioned his situation until after we slept together, he then proceeds to say that he thought I knew as everyone at work knew. I carried on believing that he was single as he‚Äôd reassure me but then someone at work said they saw him with his baby mum hugging and kissing her which he denied outright. Then he went on holiday with her for the kids and said he didn‚Äôt want to upset the kids as he booked it when they were together, he stated that he got a single room. When he was on holiday I asked him and he said there was a problem with the single room so he‚Äôs in the same room but they split the beds. If I hadn‚Äôt asked he wouldn‚Äôt have mentioned it and I‚Äôm going off the fact that he was there for a couple of days. He won‚Äôt even tell me his baby mums first name, he goes why do you want to know but I don‚Äôt understand if he is single then why is he so secretive. 

He told me he‚Äôs in love with me and he has never felt this way about anyone. He treated my like I‚Äôm special and important, he told me that I act really mature for my age. He was caring and attentive. He was funny and sweet. He told me I‚Äôm the prettiest girl he‚Äôs ever been with, he states that I‚Äôm an upgrade from his baby mum etc.

I fell pregnant and he threatened suicide and guilt tripped me into getting an abortion stating that having kids ruins your body, I am destined for better things etc. He made me feel bad by stating that I‚Äôm trying to baby trap him etc. Long story short I got the abortion. 

He always came to my place, I live alone and I only know what area he lives in, he knows so much about my life and I barely know anything about his. 

He said he needs time to fix up and he doesn‚Äôt expect me to wait nor could he ask that of me but he‚Äôd wish I did. He told me she said they are done as he previously ‚Äúcheated‚Äù on her when he was away on a boys holiday and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs genuinely over but the way he feels about me is genuine, at the same time he mentioned that they were on and off multiple times so it‚Äôs hard to believe him. He states they are over and he will move out really soon but the economic situation of the country makes me think otherwise. 

I lost my virginity to him and I can‚Äôt get him out of my head but after all the bad he‚Äôs done it‚Äôs so difficult to forgive and move past it. 

Currently he is blocked but I constantly think about unblocking him and trying to resolve things. I need advice as I can‚Äôt get him out of my mind no matter what I do. I‚Äôm in love with him, I genuinely consider him my first love and no matter how hard I try I can‚Äôt stop thinking he‚Äôll fix up for me.",Fickle_Industry2965,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15axs6k/is_he_dating_his_baby_mother_or_me_after/,1690452278.0,0.67
"Am I the only one who feels like today‚Äôs society diminishes the value of relationships?   Recently I went through a hard breakup in a long term relationship. We had dated for almost 3 years and she was my first love and my first girlfriend. As much as I still miss her, I can look back on that relationship and know it was a true, real, loving relationship. And when I think about what kind of person I want to be with and what kind of relationship I want to have moving forward I realize that it doesn‚Äôt line up with what society expects today. 

&amp;#x200B;

  For example, I don‚Äôt really want to be with a girl who has slept around with a bunch of people for fun. To clarify that‚Äôs something that I would never do either. I don‚Äôt really want a girlfriend who goes and gets blackout drunk at clubs and parties around the type of guys who only think about sex, which is simply increasing. Call me na√Øve but I feel like todays society decreases the value of relationships and lowers the amount of real relationships. Perhaps this is the reason why the marriage rate in the US has dropped nearly 60% in the last 50 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

  And while I know these standards are a good thing to have, I‚Äôm going to be going into college next year and with how prevalent all of this type of behavior is, I‚Äôm wondering how long it will be before I have the chance to find a real relationship again.

"my M25 bf follows hundreds of explicit nsfw twitter accounts even after telling me he would unfollow all of them cause he wanted to do it for me. It makes me feel like he‚Äôd rather look at them than his own gf F18 

I (18F) met my current and first boyfriend (25M) on Twitter‚Ä¶ I know that isn‚Äôt the best place to start a relationship but that‚Äôs just how things happened. We are in a long distance relationship and text/FaceTime almost everyday. We haven‚Äôt been dating for long and he already told me he loves me. He tells me everyday, and it doesn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable but I don‚Äôt say it back cause i don‚Äôt want to rush into it. He told me he‚Äôll wait as long as I need, and it doesn‚Äôt bother him that I don‚Äôt say it back. 

 When we first started talking I would occasionally send him a ‚Äúnsfw‚Äù pic and even now I sometimes send lil pics. He did the same for me, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs one sided, but after looking at his following and likes on twitter i never want to send him anything again. After he asked me to be his gf, I stopped interacting with all of my male followers on Twitter (and I have a lot who are kinda obsessed with me, not to sound cocky lol) so it really made my stomach sink when I saw that even after asking me out, he was still liking explicit and nsfw picture of women on Twitter. 
 
I talked to him about it, without directly asking him to stop, he was the one who offered to unfollow all the nsfw accounts he followed because he wanted to do it for me. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want him to do it just because I wanted him to, I wanted him to do it because he wants to do it because why would he need to be looking at that when he has a gf. I understand if he wants to watch explicit videos, but I draw the line when it comes to small accounts run by woman who are posting themselves rather than big accounts run by anonymous people posting explicit videos if that makes sense. I am definitely holding back saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù because of the accounts he follows, and told myself I wouldn‚Äôt say it until he stopped following them like he said he would. 

Honestly everyday I question if I even want a boyfriend, but then I talk to him and I‚Äôm reminded that I really like him and want to be with him. There have been times where we‚Äôll be texting and out of know where he‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúnot much, wby wyd?‚Äù And it makes me think he is texting some other girl, because what he messaged has nothing to do with what we were talking about . I‚Äôll admit I have serious trust issues cause of my dad who cheated multiple times when my mom and him were together. So I don‚Äôt know if that clouds my judgment when it comes to if he is cheating on me or not. I really hope he isn‚Äôt, and I won‚Äôt ever ask if he is cause I don‚Äôt want him to think I don‚Äôt trust him. 

Am I wasting my time or am I the one with a problem? He is perfect on paper, he compliments me alll the time, tells me how much he loves and values me, makes sure I know that he means everything he says, and tells me I‚Äôm the best gf ever (I wouldn‚Äôt say that lol). Am I wasting his time? I‚Äôm scared to even consider breaking up with him cause I don‚Äôt want to hurt him or make him feel insecure. His past relationships haven‚Äôt been great, they took advantage of his kindness and how giving he is and im scared he‚Äôll think that im just like the rest of them. I really do care about him and I almost tell him I love you every time we talk. But I can‚Äôt help but hold back cause what if he does something to prove that he‚Äôs unloyal or faking his love just to get things from me.

There have been times where he mentions our age gap and it‚Äôs made me uncomfortable cause it makes me think he‚Äôs only dating me cause I‚Äôm 18, and I‚Äôm scared he won‚Äôt want to be with me when I am not 18‚Ä¶

I really don‚Äôt know what to do and I can‚Äôt talk to my friends or family about this cause they would judge me. Sorry it is so long but if you took the time to read this I really appreciate you and this is my first time using Reddit so sorry if it‚Äôs not perfect.

Hope I didn't sound like I'm arrogante or overly prag the whole time about me 
Don't worry I know for girls personality and confidence matters the most. I don't wanna debate that :)
But still only attract  women I don't find attractive, usually looks wise or a lot older far away. Never seen to work with the one I like. I've been on so many dates. It's never mutual...
It feels like I always hurt girls or I get hurt :/

I'm pretty sure I have more confident around girls I'm not attracted to, cause I don't care about them in a romantic way. With women I like I always fucked it up,worry about anything I do. 
Probably I subconsciously behave weird around them, to not make it work cause of  fear of rejection.
Usually I get the advice to speak and date to more women I'm really into. 
But they always reject me, I feel like these countless rejections made me even more anxious around women I like. For example around them I often run out of  topics to speak about act unsure

"Why do guys keep bothering you if they‚Äôre not interested? Been talking to this guy for a while. We‚Äôre both in our early thirties. I was pretty direct about what I wanted and he gave me a little bit of an excuse (just got out of a several years long relationship, which he did and which I knew) but basically give him time and he‚Äôll come around. 

After a few months, he asked me if he should start dating (the implication being, other women). I was like ok, yeah, sure, go for it, because I figured alright, he‚Äôs not interested, we‚Äôre done. 

Then like a week later, he tried to hang out‚Äî made specific plans. I agreed mostly because I was curious and wanted to see if there was even the possibility of a friendship there but I also knew this was his last chance. He flakes and spends the whole night texting me but doesn‚Äôt ask to come hang out. That was the final straw for me so I told him, hey, we‚Äôre done here, we‚Äôre not doing this.

He kept trying to meet up with me all summer, even when it was obvious he was seeing someone else. He was constantly flirting with me. Tbh I mostly ignored him unless I was bored/lonely enough to want to talk to anyone at all but I didn‚Äôt flirt with him. Every time he asked to hang out, I made a very obvious and nondescript excuse not to. 

Then the other day, dude basically tells me in no uncertain terms: I don‚Äôt want a relationship with you and I‚Äôm dating other people. I didn‚Äôt really react because I was over it by that point and had been for months and just went on with the conversation. By total coincidence I did end up breaking up with a guy I had begun seeing (compatibility issues) later that day and he put 2+2 together from socials. 

Ever since then he‚Äôs been alllll over the place. Liking my selfies and stories, then disappears. Takes snaps at the bar in my neighborhood, doesn‚Äôt ask to hang out, disappears, and then barrages me with messages once he‚Äôs gone (that I basically ignore). It‚Äôs one thing to still want to have sex but he‚Äôs not even like, trying to make that happen 

I was going to just be cool about it because even though he‚Äôs a total fukboy, he is actually nice and helpful when you remove the sexual tension. And tbh, even though he wasted my time a bit and jerked me around a little, ultimately, it‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äî he was flaky and weird, he didn‚Äôt like, cheat on me or kill my cat. But this weird behavior is so annoying. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to just peace out on him because we have a lot in common and he‚Äôs got a lot of mutuals with me and I could see getting past this weirdness but I don‚Äôt really need or want some dude flirting with me and trying to get my attention for literally no practical reason.

"My ex (18m) and I (18f) broke up but I am having second thoughts and I know I shouldn‚Äôt. My ex and I broke up after 3 years of dating. When we dated it started off from sending inappropriate pictures. Our relationship was very centered around sexual contact. Of course he loved me and I loved him I have no doubt about that as him and I didn‚Äôt only have sex but also had hung out and played games together quite often. We texted everyday and called one another everyday. We went to school together and would make time to always see one another between classes as we had none together. All around we seemed pretty great together from the outside perspective. We were considered the power couple of the school. Unfortunately during this all, we had fought and broken up several times. Our parents broke us up multiple times too as they saw we had been sending inappropriate pictures to one another when we are 15-17. We stopped sending and only had in person sexual contact. 

Here‚Äôs where the problem is, him and I both have mental health issues that we both need to work on and I know that he won‚Äôt work on his unless we aren‚Äôt together cause he always just considered me his ‚Äútherapist‚Äù or atleast I considered me his with how he said that he didn‚Äôt need one because he had me. But I always referred him to the idea of one saying that it‚Äôs great for anyone and everyone. He says he doesn‚Äôt need one. I know he‚Äôs insecure and an over thinker and I think the idea of needing a therapist and hearing it from his girlfriend made him insecure and upset. Anytime I mention the idea of one he would get mad at me. We also have had a lot of issues regarding me being sexually abused multiple times during our dating, not by him but by a family member and someone who I had considered a friend. This damaged our relationship a lot as he made me feel the assault by my friend was my fault. His dad sort of convinced him of this also saying that I ‚Äúhad to have been flirty with him‚Äù which is untrue. He doesn‚Äôt blame me for the family member one as It was when I was in the ages 8-10 years old during that period of time it was occurring. 

I have left him multiple times in the past but I had always came back to him. He has always made me smile and happy. There is more to the story of why we broke up recently but the just of it was that I moved to a different area and I started to realize that I had relied so heavily on him that I now know I didn‚Äôt need him as much as I made myself think I did. I can now make friends and find y own person as he was very protective and obsessive over me which I never minded until it came to where he accused me of cheating on him with anyone I talked to. 

Sorry if this is so jumbled I am very stress as I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I should probably just take a break from dating all around and try and work on what and who I want as a person but I am scared to officaillay commit to that because I don‚Äôt want to lose him. He has his flaws but I really do love him and care for him.

"My ex date is threatening me 31F Hey everyone! Im in a really weird situation right now. I started seeing this woman who is 31F and im 25M it lasted for 2 weeks. We had sex couple of times always protected. She took morning after pill for the first night. Nothing suspicious happened but we wanted to be sure. A day later she texted me i found condom inside my vagina. First day we were drunk so i said maybe it did slip away but im pretty sure that i did not ejaculate on that day. And a day later she took another pill.

Then she started acting horribly to me in an abusive manner. Told me that i should be paying for her doctor appointment, bacterial tests, hcg test and everything. And sent me her iban and i should send her money. Of course I didn‚Äôt cause it was so suspicious for me. She did a pharmacy test 2 days later since our sexual intercourse and it was negative i did show it to 7 different woman they all said its negative. She claims that it is positive‚Ä¶


So i offered her to split the doctor bills and she claimed that i should be paying for all. If not she will go to the police. I don‚Äôt even know if i did something wrong or illegal. Well i took her an appointment for 10 days later since our intercourse. The day of the appointment arrived and she said i should be cancelling the appointment cause she had her period. 

3 days later she texted me her period lasted for 2 days and i should be getting an another appointment. And she claims that she started vomiting. (Its been 3 weeks since we had intercourse, every woman i asked said that she is bullshitting since it doesn‚Äôt start that early).  I asked her if she can do another pharmacy test so we can have an idea if she is pregnant or not and she rejected it and called me idiot and said that they are not reliable at all. And if im not paying her doctor bills that she would go to the police.

So i asked women around me and they all told me to block her cause she makes no sense. Im completely lost like why would she reject to do a pharmacy test before an hospital test if they are suspicious of pregnancy‚Ä¶

"Hypothetical - Was rape or assault committed at the end of this hypothetical date. Lets say a woman and a man had a lovely evening drinking and listening to music at his house. He ends up making a move and they start kissing, the kissing escalates all the way to sex. Now the girl never told him no or stop at any point either verbally or with a physical gesture and her body language actually seemed encouraging. She allowed every escalation and from his perspective she seemed like she was clearly consenting based on body language. 

However this girl actually didnt want to have sex, she was just a very agreeable person who had trouble communicating her boundaries and did not want to say no to the man for whatever reason so she allowed him to have his way. After the sex she really regrets the night and never speaks to the man again.

"Confusion over a man cutting himself off before finishing I am highly confused. I have a friend I met online, we have met only once before this encounter....the first time we hooked up with just making out and mutual masturbation, I thought it was really fun! We communicated after and he said he had fun, although I came and he did not....I only used my hands on him that time, not my mouth. So now, he comes over, we are pressed for time as my babysitter is only watching l.o. til a certain time. He took his pants off and sat on the couch, in the car on the way over, and in texts, I said I wanted to give him oral...we kissed,  I went down on him, he got very hard, pretty fast, was moaning...enjoyed it, precumming, called me a good girl, cuz thats how we play...he had been previously been  playing with and licking my breasts, he suddenly told me-take off your pants! I kinda mildly protested that we didn't have time, it was his turn for an orgasm. He fingered me a bit and we had some pentration, he asked me to come for him, then he hopped off, saying 'I'm finished"" I was like, wait, what, did you cum and I didn't notice? He still had a semi, didnt feel like he was soft inside. He said ""no, I'm just finished"". I'm a pretty big girl, and this was missionary-  he honestly seemed a bit tired. But WHY didn't he try to cum?! Is that not weird, I don't usually have this experience with guys. I asked him if he was okay-he's like yeah, let's save it for next time. Should I just leave it at that? I don't understand. The only other factor is he often boasts about being high (weed) and tonight I thought he smelled like alcohol, I asked and he said no. But it's a possibility. On the way back to drop him off, he was worried that now I'm thinking he's ""not good enough in the sack"" (I didn't say that) . A confidence thing? What gives?

"Urgent Help! Please The title is true‚Ä¶ I need urgent help. 

About me:
23M make 400+k. Ready to have a serious relationship. Muslim and religious. Want a girl whose covered since to me it signifies modesty and virginity. 




Introduction:
So I‚Äôm a  pretty good looking Muslim who used a Muslim dating app. 

Matches with this girl. I did great job flirting. She wanted me number. And even before I responded she tried calling on the app, which I didn‚Äôt answer because I was busy. 
She spammed me with messages. 
I gave it to her but told her a riddle for it. 

Immediately I get a text from
Montreal. I live in Toronto running a towing business and also have a location in Montreal‚Ä¶ I messaged her thinking she was a customer. 

She already starts flirting with me saying how she needs help because she‚Äôs stuck in the washer. 

Eventually we speak. Went well. Spoke for 4 hours. We both went for a virtual walk where I walk at a park and she does too. Was my idea. I like a lot about her. Her mom left her. My dad left me. It‚Äôs really weird but during the time her mom left her and my dad left me happened the same year. I kinda find that fascinating 


 Anyways She tells me she has to satisfy herrself every nightht before she goes to bed. That was the sexiest fucking thing ever. I started touching myself. Asked her what she liked. She told me. She asked me. I told her. I asked if she was playing with her self. She said yes. 
 But because I‚Äôm a devoted Muslim (and she is too). Sex after marriage. I told her if we‚Äôre getting married I can continue. She said she needed time
Because she just got out of a relationship. (I know I made a mistake there coming off like I‚Äôm in love with her after meeting her (but I am)). Before we went to bed she said she was spank me if I‚Äôm talking to other girls 

The next day went well‚Ä¶ she texted me. I texted back later on. She then called me while she‚Äôs at work. Told me she‚Äôs having a problem with her boss. She said her boss said she could take the day off. She went to ask him. And he said no I said if you want to quit you should. He was very rude. I told her to quit. She did‚Ä¶ afterwards I told her how she can help me find leads and I‚Äôd give her $100 or so‚Ä¶ again I think another mistake‚Ä¶ I told her we can focus on her potentially working for me as opposed to being sad about quitting. She said she wanted to talk to her sister. I kept saying not to because she will make the situation bigger than it seems. 


Anyways‚Ä¶. Problems start. I told her how everything will be ok etc. she didn‚Äôt respond. I texted her the next day saying let me know because I feel liable. Which is true‚Ä¶ maybe her sister told her it‚Äôs my fault and stuff. Still no respond. Following day I sent her screen shot of a Turkish girl I was FaceTiming with to get her attention and a voice note (forgot to say that all we‚Äôve ever sent each other was voice notes I‚Äôm typing to fast because I‚Äôm mad)


She fucking calls me at 1:30am when she hears it‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt answer. She send two voice notes, 1 minute each. Where she pretty much says we can get to know each other and how she got out of a talking stage‚Ä¶

Anyways‚Ä¶ we spoke that day FaceTimed I showed my self where she didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt ask her too especially if she didn‚Äôt want too. The same day she sends me voice messages about how her aunt is getting divorced and it‚Äôs making her so upset. 

We kept talking and shit via voice memos. I texted saying that I‚Äôm promise they're not gonna divorce. Yesterday I replied to my text ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not gonna divorce‚Äù with an I right or am I right?  No response. 

Today this morning I sent a voice memo being flirty. 


Honestly‚Ä¶ I think I was to availble for her and responded to fast. But my fucking job relies on answering my phone and driving around. If I am not on my phone I lose money.

"Should I be worrying about this? My (23F) boyfriend (35M) went to sleep instead of finishing round 2 of sex last night. 
So basically as the title says....we have been together for 6 months, have a pretty good sex life, see each 3-4 times a week and have sex once or twice a night. 

Last night we were both pretty tired (I got up at 5 am, he got up at 7 am) before going to bed, but had sex at like 11 pm. Then showered, got ready for bed by like 12 am. We were talking, joking about me needing round 2 but him being too tired. Then, he said he was horny from the convo but too tired to have sex again and I couldn't do a blowjob bc I had a root canal in the morning. 

So he said ""just jerk me off, you need to learn how to do this"" and I said ""we should just wait until tomorrow, i want you to be horny for sex tomorrow."" And he was like ""no i want it now"", so I started...

But he wants it in a very specific way without lube so it was difficult to do without the lights on, just trying to do it by feeling how his hand moves and copying him. So eventually he just took over jerking off while feeling my body. But he went soft and was like ""let's just go to sleep, i'm too tired and you made it into a whole thing, i'm not feeling turned on anymore."" 

I thought he was trying to say i did something wrong, and when I asked - he said I didn't and that we are all good...but i don't know, I feel worried that I didn't perform well or that he is not satisfied. 

For some additional context, some other things that make me feel like this: 

\- he had to teach me how to do blowjobs in the beginning in the specific way that he likes, and it takes him like 15-20 mins to cum from it still 

\- it takes him like 5-10 mins to jerk off with porn, but takes him like 30-45 mins to cum from sex 

\- he calls me a pillow princess like half-jokingly (I definitely kind of am) but idk if he feels unsatisfied 

\- he is a lot more experienced than me, I've really only ever had long-term sex with 2 other people

Is this just normal in longer term relationships and I'm overthinking it or did I do something wrong? I'm freaking out.

"Is my current boyfriend not good for me? Now I know if I have to ask that question, he‚Äôs probably not. The reason why I‚Äôm asking here, is I‚Äôm not sure who I can go to in my life right now to discuss this with, so hello Reddit lol. Thanks for taking the time to read. 

I‚Äôm not going to get into it too much, but we‚Äôve been friends since highschool and are coming up on our one year anniversary. We‚Äôve been in the same friend group and he decided to pursue me last year, very thoughtfully. I had been out of the dating scene for quite a while (5 years to be exact, I‚Äôm 23, still pretty young but ya know) and I was definitely swooned. Considering we‚Äôve been close friends for so long and I had a budding attraction as the idea began being introduced, I took a while with myself to make sure I wasn‚Äôt committing out of loneliness. 

However, when we started dating, I saw a huge shift in who he is, or maybe I just started picking up on stuff that I ignored for years, because I hadn‚Äôt thought of him romantically until last year. Whatever it was/ is, it‚Äôs made me question a bunch about myself and him. I like to think I people read as well as the next person, but this man is not easily read. I‚Äôm concerned firstly, he said one of the reasons he pursued me is because he admired how empathetic I can be, whereas, he struggles with empathy. He‚Äôs very logical, and has a strict set of principles he follows. Originally, I thought it was sweet bc he made it seem like he wanted to learn from me and I found it highly respectable that he knew that about himself, and thought I was the one able to help him improve, but anytime I try to breakdown empathy with him, he seems incapable of putting himself in someone else‚Äôs shoes, and his sympathy feels forced, if that makes sense.I find it difficult to teach someone how to be empathetic, especially when they push back, which he does. 2.) he‚Äôs outwardly said to me he gets enjoyment out of pushing people to the point of frustration, ‚Äúbecause he‚Äôs right.‚Äù And he is definitely very smart, and a lot of times, is right. Like I said, very logical. But my gut screams at me bc that doesn‚Äôt sit right with me, but then again, I am the opposite. He runs toward conflict, I tend to avoid it like the plague. 2.) rarely does he apologize, but I also haven‚Äôt been great at expressing my feelings towards him these past couple months.3.) he‚Äôs going for nursing, ultimately, wants to be a mental health professional. I worked as a pca for the last couple years at a hospital, i of course love that he is! But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm concerned because I myself have a variety of mental health disorders (ptsd being the root), and I fully accept that I have not been doing what I need to do to care for myself, nor do I expect him to be my personal therapist. I have a therapist for that, just haven‚Äôt worked up the courage to address this with her, mostly bc I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll confirm my suspicions, and encourage me to get out. (Another ah ha moment)

I have noticed as I had been struggling mentally, he is unable to think about how the emotions are affecting me, and he is the very first person to ever tell me I‚Äôm difficult to talk with. I‚Äôve prided myself on having enough emotional self control to separate my emotions and weigh them with logic (rationalizing, which he does a great job) but he brings out a side of me that I don‚Äôt recognize, and it‚Äôs angry. However, I felt at times he pushed me to the point of breaking, or maybe it‚Äôs a combo of the things I haven‚Äôt resolved yet. 

Anywho, I know that‚Äôs a lot and I said I‚Äôd keep it short. So much to unpack, it‚Äôs the shortest I can make it.

"Had some ED issues while on a date. Wish I knew the cause. I had a date with an indian woman I met at a club. She's 32, works in IT, and still a virgin and wanted lose the V that night. I got to her place, we had some pizza then got into the foreplay.

I should mention that on the bus ride to her place, I started to get some ""hot"" feelings in my bowel but they quickly subsided, therefore I ignored it.¬†

I wanted to have foreplay like I used to with my ex: Where we'd shower first, then use hands on each other, oral then sex. This girl wanted to do it differently. As me and her stripped down to our underwear, I fingered her and she jerked me. We had discussed what she'd like to do before and she said she was happy to do oral with me going down and she returns the favor, however that night she didn't want me going down on her and wanted me to go straight to the sex.¬†

The ""hot"" feeling was on and off now in the bowel and I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious but I also wanted to focus on this.¬†
I tried to enter her but for some reason I lost my erection right as I put on the condom. I still tried anyway but she was too tight and I went too soft so we couldn't continue.

I didn't want to use the bathroom but the ""hot"" feeling got worse and I had to go. She was cool with letting me stay and watching a few movies but I ended up having to get up a few times throughout the night to go back and forth to the bathroom. It was some bad diarrhea.¬†

I felt ashamed of not being able to get it up since I do watch a fair bit of porn while using sex chat rooms. I have been doing this for sessions of 4-8 hours and twice a week. I am trying to manage this use.

"How to choose whether to be exclusive with someone ? During high school and college, I (M23) was interested in dating a few people at various points, but they were never interested in dating me. Now that I'm out of college, I started using Hinge, and the situation is completely reversed. I'm not really sure why (I've never felt attractive before and I didn't glow up or start making massive amounts of money after college), but I get a lot of matches --- enough that I can go on dates most days of the week if I want to. I'm happy about getting to actually date for the first time in my life, and it is a lot of fun, but I'm completely new to the experience of having to consider multiple potential dating partners at once (in the past I usually became close friends with someone specific before I started to be interested in dating them, so my potential dating partners never numbered more than 1).The problem is that after 5-6 dates, the question of exclusivity comes up, and I feel a lot of pressure to go exclusive with whoever I started going on dates with first. By then I can tell that I'm attracted to them and find them interesting, but usually I don't know them nearly as well as I've known the people who I liked in the past and therefore don't feel the same way about them. So the natural questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) If I like someone after 5-6 dates but they don't make me feel the same way as someone from my past who didn't want to date me, should I agree to date them exclusively when they ask ?  It makes sense that those feelings might develop from putting more focus on getting to know them as a result of being exclusive, but it also feels like a lot of risk to commit to dating someone when I don't feel that way about them yet. It also feels like I'm leading someone on if I agree to that when I know I don't yet feel about them the same way I felt about someone else in the past (although it took a lot longer than 5-6 meetings to feel that way about that someone else).

&amp;#x200B;

(2) If I agree to date someone exclusively, and then a few months later (even if the dating experience is nothing but positive and I am still attracted to them and find them interesting) I conclude that I really don't feel the same way about them as I did about someone else from my past who didn't want to date me, should I break up with them ?  It feels wrong and entitled to do that to someone who cares about me and contributes something positive to my life, especially based on a comparison with someone who didn't care about me in the same way. I obviously know how much it hurts to be rejected by someone you are close to, and I hate the idea of making someone feel that way. If that is an okay thing to do (as opposed to staying in the relationship that is working fine for everyone), does anyone have any advice on how to break up with someone after a few months of dating exclusively in a way that is as respectful and polite and non-hurtful as possible ?  I know that it will have to hurt them no matter what, but I've been rejected inreally cruel ways that made me feel awful about myself and I don't want to do that to someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) \[a variant of (1)\] The following situation has happened to me twice so far: I download Hinge, and start going on dates with people. I end up having gone on 5-6 dates with the first person I matched with (""person A""), and there's a few others who I've gone on \~3 dates with who I also like (""persons B-D""). But by this point person A is asking for an exclusive dating relationship. It's a really hard choice to make because I haven't gotten to know people B-D as well yet (and as remarked in (1), in absolute terms I don't know any of them that well yet), and I don't have much prior dating experience. Of course I could ask person A for more time being non-exclusive in order to be more sure about each other --- obviously this depends on the woman, but (among women who want a serious long-term relationship) are people typically okay with this or do they typically take this as a sign of general unwillingness to commit and decide to stop dating ? If the consensus is that asking for more time from person A might as well be ""breaking up"", do people have advice about what to consider when choosing between continuing to date person A or not ?",troybarnes691,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15as2fm/how_to_choose_whether_to_be_exclusive_with_someone/,1690432957.0,1.0

"I feel as if I had lost the love of my life There‚Äôs this guy, that i‚Äôll call Gerard, i met him (almost) 5 years ago.  When i first met him, he was the kindest guy i had ever met in my whole life. As time passed, Me and Gerard fell in love, we dated for around 6 months (all this, being a long distance relationship), everything seemed ok to me, but then suddenly he told me he found another girl, naturally, i was confused, but i already expected that since he had been acting weird the days before that. I don‚Äôt remember much, but i do remember that we had been losing all the communication we had. When he told me he got someone new, we had an argument and decides to stop talking to each other (Here it was already 2019). This did not last long, we only distanced for one month, we both apologized and were in good terms once again. Ever since that, we kept on talking, but i couldn‚Äôt see him like that again. By December of 2019, i started slowly having a crush on someone, i‚Äôll call her Ale, i ofc told him since after all i trust him way more than i even trust myself, he was ok with it. Here comes an important part, one that i regret so much. Gerard confessed to me on 2020, precisely on Valentine‚Äôs Day. I was flattered, but again, i already liked someone else by that time. I had to (sadly) reject him. I regret rejecting him so much. One month after that, i started dating Ale. He was always there to support me even though i wasn‚Äôt in a relationship with him. Soon then, arguments started with Ale, long story short, i was being constantly mentally abused by Ale. Gerard always told me that Ale was being a total jerk and that i should leave her. I didn‚Äôt. I regret not doing so, but i was blinded by my feelings. As time passed, i ended up breaking up with Ale in 2021 since she cheated. Gerard always supported me emotionally, he was always there for me. We did date by this time, but i told him that i wasn‚Äôt ready to have a relationship. Soon then, 2022 came in. We still talked a lot by January, even February, maybe. But that communication started going down, slowly. He told me he no longer wanted to talk to me by the time by August of the same year. I was hurt, sure, but i told him that i was ok with that. Time passed, and we started talking again this year, on May. We both talked it out, and started talking daily. We called almost every day at nights. It was the first time in a while i‚Äôve ever felt so damned love by someone. If i had to be honest, he is the best guy i‚Äôve ever met. He treats me so sweetly that it even overwhelms me. Everything was fine, until a week ago. He told me he needed time. I obviously understood it and told him i was okay with that if it was the best for him. But, i do miss him a lot. I‚Äôve cried.

"I (16M) Can't Get Over My Feelings for My Girl Best Friend (16F) I recently just had the most incredible day at the theme park with my girl best friend, and I need to share this heartwarming experience with all of you and ask for your opinions. We've known each other since we were around 5, and she means the world to me.

So, we decided to tackle this insanely long line for a ride, and let me tell you, it felt like an eternity‚Äî3 hours of queueing! üòÖ But in all honesty, I wouldn't trade that time for anything. We held hands throughout the wait, not just to stay together but also because it felt comforting, special and helped pass the time.

The real magic happened when people started jumping over a fence to escape the queue. My girl best friend found herself in the way of the fence, so she leaned back, and instinctively, I hugged her from behind. I kid you not, when she looked back and smiled, it felt like a million butterflies fluttered in my stomach. It was such a genuine and intimate moment that it left me feeling overwhelmed with emotions.

Now, I can't stop thinking about that moment and what it might mean. I've had feelings for her for some time now, but this experience at the theme park has only intensified them.

So, here I am, trying to figure out what to do next. Should I tell her how I feel or keep these emotions to myself to protect our friendship? I'm genuinely torn, and any advice or similar experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated.

"Starting a relationship with a very good friend I have this friend 37F of 20 years. Her and I(38M) have always had this really intimate connection. We can be really open around each other. Shes the only woman in my life I've really felt this way about. We have had sex many times and its always spectacular. I've always wanted a relationship with her but because of distance i never tried and i never knew how she truly felt. Weve met up many times to hang out, we always end up just holding onto eaxh other. She asked me the other day how come we never tried to have a relationship. It's been long distance at times with our friendship. She lives on the other side of the country  but, I want to try anyway. Distance can be overcome after all. I feel really nervous about this, mainly because I'm scared of messing it up. We've always just been there for each other.

"Acceptable to ask out a job applicant that was rejected? I understand that asking a coworker out is frowned on these days. Yet my parents met each other at work. I wouldn't be here if they didn't have a relationship.

I recently interviewed a candidate. She was rejected by other managers. I did not reject her application and she was my first pick. She was my first pick based on her professionalism and skills. So her application rejection had no agenda on my part. She has no future prospects at the company.

I really enjoyed talking to her. I felt that we were very in sync during the interview. She was obviously polite since it's an interview but it just felt like time flew by. After I phoned her about the rejection she also asked me if she could connect on linked in (not sure if this is common practice).

There's no power that I hold over her at this point. I've clearly told her that she won't be hired. And if she was employed I would not ask her out under any conditions, because we would not only be co-workers but I would also have been her boss.

I assume the resounding answer here will be that asking her out is predatory and stupid. Yet a female coworker made a joke to me that I could ask her out now that she's been rejected. This was after expressing that I was disappointed in her being rejected.

Thoughts?

\- Would it be creepy if I reached out a few weeks after the rejection to ask her out on a date?

\- Is asking for a linkedin connection from the person hiring you after being rejected normal? Is this an indication of interest?",giveuporfindaway,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15aqm4v/acceptable_to_ask_out_a_job_applicant_that_was/,1690428522.0,0.67

"Not looking for a relationship I‚Äôve been dating this girl for about 6 weeks seeing her probably 3 times a week. We‚Äôre only 18 so met in a pub smoking area where she approached me. She‚Äôs been massively into me by what she has sent and said to me. I get along with her friends and all. We went on a date last week where her friend was there. She wanted to see me afterwards without the friend being there but i had plans booked weeks in advance so had to let her down (kind of shit ik but not my fault i have friends) replies slowed down after so spoke to her about it this week and what was going on. She‚Äôs said that‚Äôs she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship at the moment and needs to sort herself out. Usually I‚Äôd think this would be a kind way of rejecting me but she has a troubled family life and a mum that‚Äôs quite sick as far as i know which leads me to doubt the rejection idea. It also seems very different to how she was treating me only 5 days ago.

I accepted what she said and said that hope whatever is going on sorts itself out and have left it there. My current plan is too leave it 3/4 weeks and then arrange to meet up with her and mutual friends and see where it goes from there.

"My 19F boyfriend 18M broke up with me after almost 2 years A little background: my now ex (I‚Äôll call him Dan) and I were very close a few years before getting together but stopped talking due to me getting into a toxic relationship and not being ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to talk to guys. Almost as soon as I got out of the relationship, we rekindled out spark and fell hard and fast for each other. Over the past let‚Äôs say 2 years, Dan and I have had an amazing relationship. He helped me heal with what I had went through in that toxic relationship and we spent almost all of our time together. We moved up to college together. The only thing was we would fight. Now I understand every relationship has its arguments but sometimes we argued a lot and I take the blame for most of those fights. I would get upset over little things and it would spiral into an argument. But after every fight we came back and we were constantly going out to dates or just spending time together. Fast forward to a couple days ago. Him and I were the happiest we had been in a long time but we got into a pretty big fight. We both did things very wrong in that fight. The fight boiled down to how I felt like the effort and respect he used to give me was a lot less than what he was giving me now. I felt very upset because we had talked about what we both needed from each other and I gave him everything he head asked for but I felt as if I was hardly getting anything I said I needed. We went back and forth for a couple days saying if we were together or not and it crushed me to imagine myself without the person I felt was my person. The other night he had decided that we would be together and work on it together but I was terrified that he would would back out or leave again and lo and behold he did the next day. We had a very good talk and both agreed that we could go back to just being friends but honestly I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôll hurt me more and I don‚Äôt know how to just be friends with him. I love him with all my heart but I‚Äôm also scared of being hurt again. We also agreed that maybe once he got the mental help he needs that maybe we can try us again. Any advice. I was so in love with him and even though I know we are young I feel like what we had was special. He would talk about me to everyone he talked to and he would spoil me like crazy.

"I‚Äôm (19) having some issues with this guy I‚Äôm seeing (24) about paying 50/50 on dates Him and I have been talking since the beginning of June. He moved here to Miami a few months ago from Spain for work. When we met in person I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him but as we‚Äôve opened up and gotten to know one another I‚Äôve grown to like him. 

He does not have a car. Ever since our first date I have been the one that picks him up and drives us to wherever we go. Now, I don‚Äôt have an issue with that but what is bothering me is how I am the one that drives 30-40 minutes to pick him up from his job and then another 20 minutes to go back to his apartment to then have to pay for parking (which is awfully expensive in Miami). I‚Äôve also been the one that has been paying for parking wherever we go out. 

And the times he‚Äôs ubered food for us while at his place, he‚Äôs made a point to buy the cheapest food he can find and has said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only paying for you because I really like you, I don‚Äôt do it for everybody‚Äù. Which absolutely rubbed me the wrong way. The times we‚Äôve gone out, he‚Äôs passed up any and every restaurant after I‚Äôve suggested we go out to eat because he doesn‚Äôt feel like paying for food so we just don‚Äôt get anything. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not being met in the middle with paying for things and it‚Äôs frustrating. I realized thats something very important to me and I needed to talk to him about it. 

Last week we went out and when we went back to his place (after I payed for mall parking, parking at his place and made the drive to pick him up from his job) I expressed that I wanted him to put more of an effort in paying for parking and have things 50/50. He said that he had cash but couldn‚Äôt zelle me anything because his bank account which is from Spain, doesn‚Äôt have zelle. He still has not made an effort to pay me half the parking for just that one time. He also doesn‚Äôt really put effort in planning our dates. He‚Äôs always asking me what we‚Äôll be doing and never takes the initiative in making plans, which is something I want him to do. 

He‚Äôs a great guy, and we both prioritize communicating and being open with one another about where we see ourselves taking this relationship .

But I don‚Äôt figure all of this out untill after 3 months. Is there any way to know if they‚Äôre just in it because they think you‚Äôre naive or you just have a pretty face and body to fuck?

"Situationship advice Okay I will try to be as short as possible. I‚Äôm a female and I will refer to my guy as T.
Me and T met on a dating app in march. He is a very strange (in a good way) person, veryyy mysterious, an outsider. We started texting on insta like once or twice a week, nothing special. I‚Äôve always liked him a little since he is very interesting to me and I can‚Äôt seem to understand him which makes me want to know him more‚Ä¶
In the beginning of july he texts me his address and asks me to hang out (out of nowhere). I agree, we meet, first 10 minutes were very awkward, he was very nervous. We talk more, some random things and I noticed that he avoids talking about his personal life, so I don‚Äôt ask him too much. We laid on the grass, we talk, he asks to kiss me (very respectfully), I agree, we kiss. It was not an ‚ÄúI wanna f*ck you kiss‚Äù. It was actually very romantic and something I‚Äôve never felt. He held my hand all the time, kissed my forehead, played with my hair. During the date I ask him what he is looking for and he told me that he is ready for a relationship but wants to go with the flow and doesn‚Äôt wanna rush anything. He told me he is not looking for one night stands, but he used to when he was younger. He took a break from dating because he used to get very possessive.
He walks me home, everything is great until he doesn‚Äôt text me all week after the date. I texted him to ask him how is he, he sends me a video of him cooking and basically we talk like nothing happened one week ago. After that he randomly texted me about an insta story I posted days ago (he doesn‚Äôt follow me on insta, just stalks me)
Then this sunday he asked me out on a second date like 20 days after the first one. He texted me ‚ÄúI bought a hammock and I can‚Äôt wait to kiss you there‚Äù 
We go out, we kissed,laid chest to chest with each other. It was the most romantic thing I experienced. Nothing sexual happened (I told him long time ago I need time). He constantly asked me if I‚Äôm comfortable.It was just pure affection. We talked about random shit, I told him about my issues with my father and he was very understanding. He walks me home, holding my hand. Then he texts me ‚ÄúTell me how you are feeling after the date‚Äù 
The next day he texts me again out of nowhere and he recommended me a book and told me ‚Äúyou are not responsible for your dad behaviour‚Äù
That was in monday and we haven‚Äôt texted in 3 days. I‚Äôm starting to realise that Im falling in love with him and the thought of him possibly talking to other girls is killing me. Of course I can‚Äôt blame him since we are not dating. But I can‚Äôt do that ‚Äúno label ‚Äúthing.
What should I do? How do I ask him? Do you think he wants a relationship with me?

Women are out there I went yesterday to a young professionals meeting and saw maybe 4 or 5 women who were new and were in corner no one approached them. Anyways I made a pact with myself to meet new women and ask them out in person. Last few times I gone out I have been talking to women more.

My problem is sometimes you meet someone and talk for say 30-45 minutes then disperse but what is a great way to get her number without it being awkward or interrupting her. Looking for advice as I improved one aspect and now looking to get better at dating IRL. I feel that I am close but that if I ask them ASAP it will be better situation. Just have to find out how or what to say.",sebastianotd1991,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15am85q/best_way_to_ask_for_her_number_without_awkwardness/,1690416271.0,1.0
"Hinge definitely is my favorite dating app The algorithm on this app just seems to work way better than Bumble, OkCupid, etc. It's mostly people wanting a relationship entirely. I like that it also limits likes so I'm not endlessly scrolling.

I have kind of gotten into a rhythm though of just buying some roses and sending them out to the standouts....because the people they give me are very on point. 

It took a few days of swiping to really train the algorithm to me but...definitely worth it.

Others like OkCupid I find the % to be totally useless at times. The questions are too broad. Just also say less active.

I've probably have gotten the most matches on it

Bumble and Tinder I find a lot more just people wanting hookups",k032,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15acyt6/hinge_definitely_is_my_favorite_dating_app/,1690394560.0,1.0

"I'm tired of being sexually unattractive Dating for the past few years have been pretty difficult for me. I'm always told that I'm nice to talk to or I'm sweet, but there's never any sexual attraction to me. The last woman I was dealing with was really enthusiastic about me at first, but then later down the line she eventually just admitted she's not sexually attracted to me. Its like I always have to ignore the fact that I have a sex drive because I know that I'm just not the kind of guy that woman would be intimate with for some reason. I'm not fat, I'm in good shape, I take my hygiene seriously, but for some reason I just don't have any sex appeal. 

After this last situation I'm not even sure if I want to continue dating anymore. I know there's more to relationships than sex, but it really does make me feel like crap to be told ""Hey you're cool, I just wouldn't ever think of touching you though."" basically. When I was younger, like in my early 20s ( I'm 32 now) I didn't really have this issue to this extent. I dealt with a few people who wanted to be intimate with me.

"I pushed someone away About 9 months ago I was fresh out of a seriously draining relationship. There was a lot of drama and it was definitely toxic. I've gone through a lot of therapy to get over it. I met this guy at a concert and didn't expect to get into something so soon but it just happened. He treated me really well even though he was kind of overbearing and got ahead of himself. He was immature and moved insanely quick. I got scared and pushed him away because I wasn't ready to move so quick even though I really liked him. He was crushed.

My ex saw him at a party a few months after that and then my ex messaged me saying he told him the reason I pushed him away was because I was still messing with him. I told him that was really messed up he lied to him and to leave him and me alone but I never messaged the guy I had pushed away about it to tell him that's not true.

Fast forward to now. I am feeling healed and ready for a healthy relationship. My first thought went to this guy. I went to follow him on Instagram since I didn't have an Instagram before and he immediately blocked me. I made a burner account and saw that he just recently got in a relationship. I'm crushed. There's so much I wanted to say and clarify and I hate the way it all ended. I truly think it was the right person wrong time, and now I'm too late.

How can I feel better about this? It's no one's fault really.

"How to navigate dating as a demisexual person? Hello, I (28F) am demisexual. I do feel sexual attraction to men, but only after a connection has been formed and I really like them. My first serious relationship was when I was about 21, and while he ended up being very toxic and I had to leave for my own wellbeing, it broke my heart because I was head over heels for him and enjoyed being with him in that way. My last relationship was about 3 years ago and it was awful, I did not like him much at all and had to fake everything (I was very mentally ill and he was not a good boyfriend.) Since then, I've done a lot of work on myself and while I do not plan to go out and start trying to find a partner tomorrow, it is my goal to start trying again in a few months time.  


My question is, how do I explain this to people in a dating situation? I did not realize I was demisexual the last time I was on dating apps, but now I do. ""Hello, I do not want sex and will probably not want it for an undetermined amount of time unless I really end up liking you""...I just feel like there will be lots of guys who do not understand, do not believe me, or ignore that.

"First time dater here, need advice. Two great dates, but I feel like im more interested. So I (m24) met this bi guy (21). I only went on 2 online dates and one semi date before, never been in a relationship. He had relations but only to women, he just made out with a guy once.


I saw him twice in a bar without talking to him. The third time I met him through friends in a park. I sparked up the conversation by asking him if we saw eachother before in that bar. He kinda hit on me and we talked for an hour, then I had to leave for work. But we did exchange numbers and set a date on the weekend. 

Date happened, it was great, spent like 13 hours in total, met some of his friends in-between. We basically befriended eachother on this date. I felt it was very romantical but I still asked him on the next day in a carefully worded message if that was a date or not, also stating I don't wanna pressure him into anything. He said yes it was, but he did not think too much about it. Which was a great answer for me, as it told me yes there is an interest but also without any pressure.

So the second date happened, also just overall great. It ended with us making out at my place and falling asleep. We were both not interested in having sex. This was the last time we met, cause he is out of town right now for a few weeks. I had plans which got cancelled so now I texted him saying I would like to visit him to which he agreed, without a set date yet.

So yea what's the catch?
1. I feel like he seems less interested than me than I am in him, even tho he did ask for the 2nd date (he did leave me the option for it not to be a date though for some reason) 
2. I just have the feeling that I am crushing very hard and I don't wanna push him away, while also doing what feels right for me.

"My Third Date - My Dating Experience on a Herpes Dating Site Let‚Äôs get to my third date. It was with this woman who I‚Äôd already known for quite a while. Though this woman was technically the third person I date from this platform, we had been communicating for quite some time before our in-person encounter. From our very first chat, there was a connection. Her life was firmly rooted in Florida, where she worked, and our virtual proximity allowed for a mutual exchange and understanding.  
  
We decided to spend an afternoon together. It started with us meeting at a local coffee shop where we filled hours with light-hearted conversations. I remember there was a certain ease to our meetup, a comfort level that only comes with familiarity.  
  
Post the coffee session, we headed for dinner. Shared meals always tend to bring people closer, and quite fittingly, we bonded over our mutual love for food.  
  
As the evening melted into the coolness of the night, we decided to go back to her place. It led us to an interesting turn of the night. She suggested sharing a bath together‚Äîan unusual but intriguing idea.  
  
And then came the moment that you might guess‚Äîa moment of closer physical intimacy, right in the bathtub, far away from the convention. But we went there, a decision meant for us and us alone. It didn‚Äôt stop there either, as we continued the scenario on her bed, weaving an experience of intimacy and connection that was unique yet familiar, a dialogue of affection expressed without words.  
  
Remember, this is less of a raunchy tale and more about the journey through a dating experience on a site that caters specifically to people with herpes. That shared understanding forms the backdrop of our interactions.  
  
So, there it was, my third date - a tapestry of fond memories, of connection built over coffee, food, amusing conversations, and mutual affection‚Äîall painted on a canvas of understanding and acceptance. This simple tale has less to do with the number in the series of dates and more with the exploration of companionship, acceptance, and shared experiences.",N111ko_for_dating,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15an0bt/my_third_date_my_dating_experience_on_a_herpes/,1690418361.0,0.25

"Need some advice So basically, I started messaging this girl about 3 weeks ago, we really hit it off, she was on holiday and I was at festival when we first started speaking, we were just sending video message after video message, we‚Äôd planned to go on a date when she got back but we changed plans because she was heavily jet-lagged, but she really wanted to see me so I stayed over at her, we spoke for hours about anything and everything, it was great and then we ended up sleeping together, there was real chemistry there, over these 3 weeks, I‚Äôd stayed over a bunch of times, cooking food and enjoying each other‚Äôs company, the texting was non-stop and we spent a lot of time together without going on an actual date, we had planned to go on dates however.

"Went on a date, we kept texting but now he's barely replying, is that a bad sign? Hi! I'm gay and I met this cute and really nice on a dating app (it was Grindr and we both hate that app, he uninstalled it 1h after). We both look for something serious and have a lot of interests in common, so our conversations are really good and never boring. Before our date he event went to say stuff like ""Well today I'm really ugly but if you like me that way then I'm good with you forever ahah"" kinda as a joke.

We went on a date, we both expressed that we liked it and after that we still talked (one day, one of our convos lasted for 2 consecutive hours). But then he went on vacations with his family and he has been very absent, I sent him some audios and texts and he didn't reply to any of them... he then sent a random meme, ignoring everything I said earlier and he hasn't replied ever since (it's been 3 days). 

I haven't had a boyfriend for 6 years and I have a huge history of getting ghosted or people losing interest on me, and replying less frequently is one of the first things that usually happens. I'm afraid that it may be the case, but I wanna make sure if I'm not overreacting or acting clingy.

Why do you play mind games with eachother? I (21M) have never dated and don't plan on doing so for a long time. I read this sub to help me understand others in different situations and what I can tell in this sub is that alot of people miss out on relationships because they're too caught up in mind games or are too afraid to just say smth awkward that they end up ruining everything. Smth else I've noticed is that alot of people will blame other things besides themselves if they can't get a date. If it didn't work out then try again another tike if you'd like.

"How do I navigate meeting the son of a family friend? Long story short, I (30F) went through a breakup of a 6-year relationship early this year. I've taken time to sit with everything that has happened and to adjust to my new situation. I'm able to feel hopeful again now and am starting to think to the future.

She broke up and told me she needed time to work things out alone. But then 6 months later she had a boyfriend and took him to Italy with her family. I suspected the reasoning for the breakup was something sex related and she didn‚Äôt tell me for fear I would react badly.

"I (21F) breakup with my boyfriend (21M) of three years and started dating another guy (21M) just after three days of breakup I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy for more than 3 years, and some time back, we decided to end the relationship. The main reasons for us to end our relationship were our constant fights, lack of understanding between us, insecurities, and all that kind of stuff.  
  
But 3 days after our breakup, I started dating one of my close friends who knows everything about me and my relationship status.  
  
Now the issue is that even when I was dating my ex, I was confused about my feelings for my current boyfriend. Initially, when I realized this, I used to tell myself some excuse or another and try to forget about it. I didn't break up with my ex then because I loved him a lot and was not sure about my feelings for that friend.  
  
Since then, it has been very hard for me to trust myself. I always fear that if my feelings for my current boyfriend change or I start feeling for someone else, then I'll end up hurting him as well.  
  
My current boyfriend knows all about my situation and my fears. He always tells me that I should not blame myself for it and start trusting myself again. But no matter how hard I try, I always end up thinking about it the same way because the fact that I got attracted to someone else even when I was in a relationship (I loved my ex a lot, and even after I got confused about my feelings for that friend, I was still sure that what I felt for my ex was very strong) is something I could never justify.

So the day came when we finally saw each other. We met at a local caf√© to have a private conversation. And in that moment when I saw her, all my concerns vanished. She was even more beautiful in person than in the photo.  
We spent several hours together, and time flew by unnoticed. We laughed, got to know each other better, exchanged tender glances and passionate handshakes. It felt like there was no one else around us, just the two of us, an inseparable couple.  
The story of my online dating experience turned into a true love story. Gradually, our dates became more frequent, and we both realized that our happiness knew no limits.  
Now, when I look back on that day, I am grateful to the dating website that helped us meet. Because sometimes, love can be waiting for us where we least expect it...",ilonason,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15a1v8t/my_dating_history/,1690367115.0,0.83

"Learning to live single around couples‚Ä¶ I F22 recently got out of a situation that took about two years of my life. I‚Äôm finally single and just trying to learn to be single. I‚Äôm not looking for love because i know i‚Äôm not ready for a relationship. All my friends around me are in couples and really it was just me and my cousin that were single. Recently she started talking to this guy and I don‚Äôt want love to be the basis of our conversations because i‚Äôm learning to live without wanting it but am constantly hearing about it. Even my closest friend who is in a relationship rarely talk about it and i appreciate that because honestly i don‚Äôt care to hear about it. Anyways i expressed to my cousin that if she‚Äôs happy i‚Äôm happy but i don‚Äôt really want to talk about that she can tell me the good stuff once in a while but for lack of better work, i don‚Äôt care. Maybe i‚Äôm being selfish but i it‚Äôs kind of like if you‚Äôre trying to quit cigarettes and are around a whole bunch of people smoking cigarettes. I get this immense pressure that I should probably put myself out there but from the deepest part of my heart I don‚Äôt want to. Am I wrong for expressing this?

"He was the perpetrator: How does he want to heal? Why do I cause him pain now? I genuinely want to understand. Last year, a guy friend (32M) was very unhappy in his unhealthy, on-and-off 5-year relationship with his girlfriend and approached me (28W) with romantic intentions. I eventually reciprocated his feelings, and we ended up falling deeply in love and thought of each other as ""the one."" But after a year of drama, indecisiveness, and entering and re-entering a toxic cycle with me, he eventually chose to stay with his girlfriend despite wanting to leave her multiple times. 

I believe they're in a codependent relationship and both of them are codependent individuals. His parents, friends, and I think his girlfriend is terrible, and he acknowledges our concerns, but what can we do at this point. 

We just ended our friendship/connection for good until we've both ""healed"" and ""moved on"" and agreed to reach out in 2 years if the conditions are right to see if friendship is possible.

**Since he called himself the perpetrator of this entire mess, I'm genuinely trying to understand:**

1. **What does he mean when he says he needs the time and space to ""heal""?**
2. **Why do I cause him pain now?**
3. This past year was painful for both of us, and he doesn't want to go through another year of hurting and being hurt. **How exactly is he being hurt?**

He didn't go into any details, so I'd appreciate hearing what you all think.

"My girlfriend is getting more distance, how should I confront her about this? Some backstory, I suggested to my girlfriend that she should make some friends online (as she doesn't go out with friends) and she agreed. This was great, I felt happy that she had someone other than me to hang around. 

That was a few months ago, it started off with only a few hours a week, since then its developed onto a streak of days where she wouldn't communicate with me (except an occasional text every 3-8 hours) I struggle from Anxiety Attachment Disorder (I wouldn't call it a disorder but my therapists named it that so I'm sorry if I have used the wrong term) I have gone to various therapist over the past 4 years for just anxiety and depression in general. Just to make things quick, my father died when I was 12 and I could never say goodbye, this triggered something as since then I always am cautious about family and friends about losing them. 

Apart from all that my Anxiety Attachment issue is mainly towards my Girlfriend, she brought me out of a very awful place in my life and I love her unconditionally for it and therefor she is valued more than anything to me. And with that I become very clingy, which was okay for us majority of the time because she never went anywhere and neither did I. The issue now is that this Anxiety has come back from fear of losing her from distance. I don't want her to stop but it doesn't feel right to not talk to her for days. I know I am defiantly being overdramatic about this but I feel like a second option in our relationship, Her friends come first. Or at least it feels like that.

She is well aware that I have attachment issues and reassures me that everything is going to be alright which I dearly love her for but I mentally can't go on with this streak. It's too little time to spend with each other. It is turning into a few hours a week speaking which especially for me is way too little. 

I want to confront her about it and talk about it like we always do but this is different. She is a very emotional person and the last thing I want to do is make her unhappy. But for the sake of my mental health I need to, I don't want her to stop hanging out with her friends but I'd rather she spend more time with me. She doesn't realize this is happening but its been going on for a while.

As a person with this anxiety, how should I tell my girlfriend that we need to spend more time together and why? (Without making her upset and seem its her fault because it really isn't)

There's a guy I'm friends with benefits with, but we aren't that good friends and the benefits are few lol.

I do enjoy the conversations though, he asks very personal stuff and shares personal stuff which is refreshing as I don't have friends to chat to at the moment, and it's stimulating. He's also nice and makes me feel good about my life, like successful and attractive etc. but not in a way that seems like hes invested in me.

We haven't talked about why he doesn't like me and he talks about other women consistently.

"Talking everyday? Long story short: Is it truly a sign of no interest if someone doesn‚Äôt check in with you daily after hitting it off well in person and even sleeping together after a few dates?


I‚Äôm really taking my time to work on myself while dating.

And I just wondered if in the past I may have demanded too much attention or wether my POV of normal behavior was or isn‚Äôt.

So I‚Äôd like to know some opinions.

After you spent time with someone, let‚Äôs say hypothetically you met someone online, went for dinner hit it off, end up sleeping with them on date 3‚Ä¶. 

Are you supposed to have consistent contact now? I read that if someone is interested they would check in w you daily.  But I‚Äôve had instances where the guys wouldn‚Äôt always do that. And I would feel a way because online it says it means he doesn‚Äôt care- even when he shows in person that he does.

I‚Äôm not talking about ghosting. When I text I get a reply. But is it really a sign of disinterest if someone doesn‚Äôt check in every day?

"got ghosted after great 3 days I‚Äôm feeling so unconfident all of a sudden

hey guys, just wanna share my story to see what you thinking.
I have been solo traveling for a while and in one place I met this girl, I instantly found attractive and charming. we went out and she got really drunk, we kissed a little bit but I saw her condition I walked her back to the hostel we were in, she said she‚Äôs very into me and sorry she was drunk.

the other day she and another friend she met(I know that from her friend) they were talking bout how nice I am and attractive blah blah blah.
In the evening I wanted to know if she‚Äôs really interested so I asked the friend and she said totally into me so I was relieved.

The night went on we had fun had sex(she told me she hasn‚Äôt done ons or something like that for 4 years) I told her I genuinely like her and she said the same to me.
the day after I had to leave but she stayed there. honestly these 2 days with her felt so great, I never got attached to someone in my trip since I knew it‚Äôd end as a one night stand.

she and her friend planned to go together to another destination. she said she missed me in text and wanted me to come with, we were texting for 2 days and 
I sent her a voice messaged (she didn‚Äôt hear it) about that I could come to see her but she never opened that text.

I honestly thought I met someone I could make meaningful connection with, and my feelings went with it. I made sure she‚Äôs interested as well, but now I feel a little confused since she ghosted me out of the blue..
right now I‚Äôm going to the same destination as hers since I planned to see her. should I let her know I‚Äôm there? or leave it as it is.

"When do you find it acceptable to have sex with someone you are dating? Do you wait for exclusivity? Hi, 

I (21F) am trying to work out how long I should wait before I have sex with a guy (24M) I have been seeing for the past few weeks. There is a lot of sexual chemistry between us both, but I have seen some people say you should wait until 5th date, or until exclusivity has been established, to sleep with someone you are dating. I'm really worried that if I sleep with him too soon, he might lose interest in me.

I have previously slept with partners on the 2nd date, and on the 7th date - and in each case, this had very little to do with why we were incompatible/ why the dating ended. It goes without saying, of course, that in lieu of exclusivity - I would be practising safe sex.

What do you think - should I wait for the 5th date, or for exclusivity, or not wait at all?",anonacc1754,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159mnrn/when_do_you_find_it_acceptable_to_have_sex_with/,1690322686.0,0.77
"What is love? üé∂üíû (Baby don‚Äôt hurt me üôÉ)

For awhile now, I‚Äôve been struggling to understand what the difference is between platonic love vs romantic love (which is odd to me since I can point out previous partners/exes/relationships I‚Äôve had)

At one point, I thought it might be that they‚Äôre both the same but romantic love also involves physical intimacy üíè

&amp; though it might involve being physical, it‚Äôs not necessary (asexual folks still have romantic relationships after all plus, the idea that physical attraction is the only difference feels wholly unsatisfactory to my hopeless romantic heart) üíñ

Then I thought it might be that the difference comes that in a romantic relationship, those involved would go home to the same house for the rest of their life üè°

But that just makes it feel like romantic partners are glorified roommates &amp; that too feels like a physical thing and again unsatisfying as an answer to me (though, maybe it‚Äôs true?)

"caught feelings from my friend and in the end I had to go end our friendship I met this friend back in janurary. She was a former coworker of mine. throughout our time working together we have gotten close. When i left the company she kept in touch with me. She would call me everyday and we would hangout occasionally. I ended up catching feelings for her. I know she had feelings for me too so in the end i asked her if she wanted to date and she happily agreed. Sadly the timing was bad tho because she had a lot going on in her life. She wasn't in the space to date so in the end we didn't date. At this point I thought I moved on but then when I heard her talking about another guy i realize I still had lingering feelings for her so in the end I ended our friendship so that I could fully move on

I still think about her time to time which shows i really liked her. Sometimes I do question if i made the right choice. I do know she is a good friend and i feel like having someone like her in my life would be good but i don't know what is the best thing. She always made me feel special and I always see that she cares a lot about me so when i ended our friendship i did feel bad and also felt like i lost a good friend

"Being nice is actually affecting me I (22M) have been on a lot of dates and when sometimes the girl starts to think I am just too good for her she starts to tell me you are eventually going to leave me and even if I am not feeling the vibe I have tend to spend a good amount of time just to make sure she isn't upset like by dropping her home or staying extra few hours. 

I feel i dont want to be seen or even create an image about all guys are just rude and shit. And even if i want to ping the any girl i have been on a date she is probably gonna be more than happy to connect with me but the thing is I get mentally drained after doing alot of these efforts. And think do I really need to do this? 

Maybe its because on one of the dates I my my date cry cos she said i was being really sweet, romantic and ""very"" cute (apologies not trying to be an asshole) and that reminded her of her ex which is why she was just meeting new people for hookups to forget about him and was not actually looking for a connection like me. I felt super guilty for some reason and it became one of the worst dates ever. 

Another time, i matched with an older girl (25F), made some imprompt plan to come over but I was a virgin that time so I didn't wanna do something to make her upset so we ended up having a 3 hour long fun chat and went to bed, we were almost about to sleep i looked at her and came close and we kissed and when i started to take her dress off she said, I never had sex before, which i knew was a lie, but we agreed to do 3rd base and i could see here getting little not comfortable and we decided to let it go. I was just mad and wasn't able to finish either so i went to bed. Then for some reason i made her breakfast and made sure she reaches her home cos she was new to the city. When i discussed this with my friend he told, we are not supposed to do all these and its okay to just ask her to leave in the morning. I don't agree with that. I got alot of messages for that girl saying you're the sweetest of all the people, thank you for the night, etc. Tho i never replied to her.

Honestly I have happy that i am able to do good for them but its just that do i really need to make all these efforts just to make them feel good and get upset and think im just another jerk who's just trying to get in bed.

"Where may I find women who do not care about looks/height? I'm 5'3"" and 21 (senior in college). How ought I go about dating at my height?
I realize height is extremely important to women and they consider short guys to be ugly; that's fine, it's their life, their prerogative. I've made my peace.

But there is always the advice for short men to go for ""women who are not shallow"" but how does one go about that? Where may I find said women?

I just wanna clarify that I do not care about looks (would be very hypocritical of me if I did lol) at all in women be it body, face, makeup, hair on head or that on body. Just being hygienic regarding bathing and brushing their teeth is enough.

I'd say I'm a good, kind person, I'm as hygienic as one can be, I try to make people smile or laugh as much as I can, am into soccer, critically viewing movies and shows, writing, read a lot, am taking Spanish class to learn the language, learning how to play guitar.

"Women: Ask the men for exclusivity instead of making theories about what you are. I genuinely want to help with this post and I think it's important that women take some moment to really think about their situations with men.

I see this time and time again. Women asking here on the forum about what to do in their current situation with a guy and it's always the same type of posts and the same type of answers.

The woman is invested, \*KNOWS\* how she feels, \*KNOWS\* what she wants and instead of communicating that directly to the guy about whatever troubles her heart or wanting exclusivity in a firm manner where she lets him know that if he's not going to give it she's looking to end it.

Instead of doing that... She comes out here seeking advice and all the advice from other women is the same: ''block him'', ''drop him'', ''he seems like a player'', ''this happened to me as well and was very hurtful''.

Just hurt women give hurt advice.

You don't know if he's a player or whatever he is until you ASK, it's when you ask and you're firm about it and show him that you're serious that you'll see his real intentions. You'll see it in his actions.

The last thing I want to say which nowadays for some reason isn't politically correct: It's the woman's job to seek exclusivity. It's been like that since the beginning of time.

Think about it... You're beautiful. Sought after by a lot of men, getting a lot of interest and so on... And here comes a man who for whatever reason is the main option for you. He passed all the tests, whether it was his looks or his way of communicating or his energy or all of them combined. He essentially was better than everyone else. He probably did some form of pursuing until he got intimacy, now after intimacy it's on you to keep him.

Or as women do you want the men to do everything? Pursue you to get you, and pursue you to keep you after intimacy? Like it literally doesn't make any sense if you think about it.

Also furthermore what a lot of women don't understand is that you're probably dating the top 20-30% of men who have a lot of options. If you're on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge or even going down to the local bar. You're not going to go with the boring/dry or not so attractive men. You're probably going to be with the men whom many different women like. If they're attractive to you and likable to you then they also appear that way to other women.

These men are already getting both invites to relationships frequently and women who want to spend time or date casually and so you're always in direct competition with these women.

At the end my final advice is this: if you meet a man and you don't care that's fine do whatever you want, but if you met a guy who essentially is the main guy for you and you are invested pursue him and communicate with him. You literally have nothing to lose. You'll only find out if he's the real guy for you by his actions afterwards.

Also some of us men need that. I needed my ex girl to communicate with me frequently and pursue me for a relationship. I had no clue whether she was playing me or not. Like quite literally, no clue. I needed to see her efforts over time. I was already attracted to her and enjoyed her company more than the other girls I was seeing at that time (we were not exclusive in the first 1-2 months)

Her doing what I felt was the job of the feminine made her stand out from all the other women because it showed me that she was a good girl. That instead of her playing the field and not caring and doing the ''female player'' type of thing she was actually interested in something real.

One of the big reasons for me going exclusive with her besides actually liking her and enjoying her company was that she was persistent and feminine. Showing me time and time again over the period of 1-2 months that her feelings was invested and she really wanted this to go somewhere.

In the end we ended for some different reasons two years later, but at least it was a fun ride.",abbehardy,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15a0rro/women_ask_the_men_for_exclusivity_instead_of/,1690363614.0,0.5
"I need advice from people on what to do I will make this as short as possible. I have been with my gf (22) for over a year. I (22) male used to have sex on a daily basis whenever we saw each other. A few months ago she went through something scary relating to self harm. I took her to the hospital. She has been better and getting treatment and taking anti-depressants. For the last two and a half months, we have not been intimate. Listen, before anyone says anything. First month I understood and just held her and was there. Second month was harder and we had a talk about it as its important to me. The last half month, she said and keeps saying idk, or I am scared. I reassure her it is okay and we can take it slow. She recently said she has no desire to have intimacy anymore and that upset me and it is partially due to the meds (which I fully get). But she has not kissed me, touched me, or done anything more than two times in that time span. I love her to death. She was in a abusive relationship in high school and it still affects her. I just do not know what to do anymore. I do not want to break up with her or pressure her, but I feel like an ass because my patience feels like it is getting to the point. For every one steps forward its one step back.

"Girl has gone cold on me. How do I approach this situation? Hi Guys, I was hoping I could get some advice on how to approach a situation with a woman I'm interested in.   
  
So I recently began talking to this woman on Hinge (she's 29 and im 35). We spoke for a couple of days and I asked for her phone number. She said she wasn't comfortable giving her number out just yet but offered to talk to me on Instagram, which I was fine with, so we followed each other and began talking there.  Turns out we share a mutual friend too, who we are both good friends with (another female).   
  
It's not often I click with people online as I'm very particular with what I'm looking for in a life partner, but this girl really got my attention. She's really cute, polite, smart, respectful, really sweet and we share the same core values, beliefs and morals.   
  
She wasn't a big conversationalist, I did find that I had to always initiate, but she was always responsive, would apologise if she took a while to respond and explain why (she didn't need to do this but I appreciated it and found it respectful), she was really sweet and would always be very appreciative of my efforts, for example I asked to if I could give her a call later that evening one day and she said that would be nice. When that evening came and I offered to call, she said she wasn't up for it that night due to a personal situation that day and wasn't in the right head space and asked if we could do it another time. I said of course, totally understand, told her I would be up for a while longer and if she felt like texting me about it she's more than welcome, otherwise I would message her the next day.   
  
She thanked me for being understanding, and she ended up opening up to me through text for the next hour or so.   
  
After a few days of talking on insta and no phone call, just voice notes here and there (she's a shift worker so it was hard to get access to her when I wanted), I just simply asked her out. She said yes, although she was busy that weekend so she said we could meet up the following week. I said no problem, happy to work around your schedule.   
  
The following week I followed up with her on Thursday to see if she's given any more thought as to when she's like to see me and sent her a link to an event that was currently on and asked her if she'd like to go with me. She said she loves activity dates and would love to go with me, and asked if we could go that night as she had plans over the weekend, which I said yes.   
  
She asked if she could drive to my place and we go together as she thought it would be stressful trying to find me in a big crowd, so I offered to pick her up instead so she didn't have to drive all the way to mine as long as she was comfortable with that. She said she didn't mind, as long as I was okay with it as it was a long drive and she felt bad. I said it was no problem for me and I was happy to do it. I gave her a time that I would be there and booked tickets. She thanked me for being so accommodating and said I was really sweet.   
  
Fast forward to the date, both of us had a really great time. We got to do a fun activity together which allowed us time to talk and get to know each other, and it's probably one of the better dates I had. At the end of the night when I dropped her off home, I walked her to her front door and she gave me a hug, thanked me for the evening and told me she had such a great time and asked if she could see me again soon. I said I would love to.   
  
The following morning I texted her, thanked her for coming and asked if she would like to to go the zoo with me (it's something we spoke about in the car). She thanked me for a wonderful evening again and told me she had a great time and that she would love to go to the zoo with me (with a smiley emoji), and I asked if she wanted to go the following weekend, as she was busy that weekend. She said she can, and I asked her what day suits her best and she said she would let me know and get back to me, with a smiley face and heart emoji.   
  
Later that evening I knew she had an event on, so I sent her a simple text saying I know you're out tonight but I just wanted to wish you a great evening and I hope you've had a lovely day. She thanked me and said that she may not be able to respond that evening as she would be busy. I said no problem at all, no need to respond tonight, I know you're busy, just wanted to wish you a great evening. Talk to you whenever you're free.  
  
The next day she messages me at 5pm, apologises for getting back to me late and then said her dad had a heart attack the night before.  
  
Now before I continue, for context, she doesn't really have a relationship with her dad due to something that happened 2 years ago (her dad was the one who stopped speaking to her).   
  
She said she didn't know what her movements would be like next week as her dad needs a triple bypass and will be in the hospital for a bit.   
  
I replied back and said that I was sorry this happened and that I hope her dad will be okay. Told her I was sad for her and not to worry, we can go to the zoo whenever she's up for it. Asked her if there was anything I could do and if she wanted to talk about it. She said not to worry, and that she's not close with him, however he is still her dad and that she needs to be there for him physically to assist.   
  
I replied and said I totally understand, and to do what she needs to do. I told her I was heading out shortly but to text me if she wanted to talk, and thanked her for letting me know. She left me on seen. I thought this was odd but didn't read too much into it.   
  
Admittedly, I was pretty bummed out as I genuinely really like this girl and I was honestly not sure if she was blowing me off or if she was being legit, as I'm not quite sure how invested she is in this situation. Nonetheless, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and carried on.  
  
The next morning I sent her a voice note just asking how she's feeling and that I had to rush out the previous night so didn't get to talk to her properly, but asked if she was okay and how was she doing. She left me on seen again.   
  
I thought no biggie, she may be out and can't listen to it. Not an issue (not the first time I've sent her a voice note).   
  
She was at a kids birthday party that day (she posted it on her story), so I figured she's just busy and would reply to me later. Nope, nothing. Waited until the next day and still nothing, even though she posted another insta story in that time.   
  
I texted her at 5:30pm and said 'Hey \*\*\*\*\*, just wanted to check in with you and see if you're okay as I never heard back. I hope everything is okay, and I hope you had a wonderful weekend üòä'  
  
She replied and said 'Sorry I‚Äôve been with my dad and now I‚Äôm prepping for my night shifts this week so I will continue to be a little MIA'.  
  
I replied 'Ah ok fair enough! I understand. I'll give you some space. I hope your dad's surgery was successful. I'll just touch base with you in a few days. In the meantime, if you feel like talking, feel free to message me'.   
  
She left me on seen again.   
  
I don't know if I'm just overthinking this, but her coldness towards me seems rather strange and out of character. I get she may be going through a difficult time, but I'm struggling to tell if it's just that, or if she's no longer interested for whatever reason. I'm just not sure how to proceed from here. Do I reach out in a few days, or just leave her be?  
  
I feel really bummed out as I really like this girl and would love to go on another date with her, but I'm not sure where I stand and it's driving me nuts. I would honestly just love to know if she's still keen, but I'm not sure how to approach her to get that answer without coming across as insensitive to her situation and potentially ruining my chances if a second date is still on the cards.

"Childhood traumas = difficulty in dating I'm (24F) the eldest sibling and I'm the only one single. My twin brothers are only a year younger than me and are already in years long serious relationships--like wedding bells ringing in the distance kind of relationships. 

I've never been in one so I'm kinda jealous. Every time I dip my toes in the waters, I back out. I always go back to the memories of my father hurting my mother physically and my mother hurting him verbally and psychologically. This happened when I was in highschool. Every night I wake up to them almost killing each other in their fights. I was the only one who witnessed it since I'm a light sleeper. My brothers sleep thru any disaster imaginable. I swear someone was trying rob our house, there were footsteps clanging on the roof, they're dead asleep. We had a major earthquake around 5 something intensity, dead asleep. I think that's why I only had this and they turned out fine.

Every teeny tiny sign of similar characteristic of my parents, it's like my eyes flash forward to how this man can potentially react to my words, my behavior, my humor, my expression, anything to eventually hurting me. Or that time when someone liked me and I tried to open up to them; I got scared that somehow I might end up hurting them by acting like how my parents did to each other. So it's a never ending cycle of me being scared of the possibility that I become vulnerable enough for them to hurt me or me hurting them. 

Aside from that I tried really hard to put myself out there like I joined parties and travelled. I also use dating apps but it's tiring to introduce yourself and talk menial things and then repeat for the next match.

"What do I do when I‚Äôm the problem? I‚Äôm 22F and have been with my 22M boyfriend for about a year and a half. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs, but are doing very well at the moment. The problem, though, is that the majority (90%+) of these ‚Äúups and downs‚Äù/ arguments / any general relationship unpleasantness comes as a result of my mental health problems. 

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and am prone to anxiety attacks and overstimulation that often cause me to behave visibly strangely and awkwardly. I have a horrible tendency to get overwhelmed and snap at my boyfriend, saying things to him in the moment that I know are unkind or uncalled for. I am also highly anxious-attachment, codependent, and sensitive. I am fully aware of all this, go to therapy for it, and am extremely displeased with how my actions affect him. I‚Äôve improved slightly over time, but nothing major. 

We‚Äôve spoken at length about this, and his most recent take on it was the (true) statement that relationships are never exactly 50-50, and that he‚Äôs willing to be there for me when I‚Äôm having a difficult time (which is almost all the time. We joke about wanting to have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù day out without some kind of disturbance from my mental health issues).

"Approach Advice: Going Out with a Co-Worker I have a crush on my co-worker. She had a boyfriend when we first met, but they seem to be no longer together. The unfortunate caveat is that she is primarily a remote worker, which limits our in-person interactions. Our conversations, albeit infrequent due to our different teams (around once monthly), are always engaging and can last up to two hours.  


  
How should I get closer to her outside of work? My connection with numerous teammates extends beyond work, although they belong to a distinct social group that she might not easily assimilate into. The challenge I face presently is my apprehension about initiating non-work interactions and that I might get too conspicuous how what I feel.  


  
How should I transition from ""work-friend"" to ""girlfriend""? Ideally, I would want to hang out with her a few times outside a professional setting before asking her out.",tinderdating23,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159z4qd/approach_advice_going_out_with_a_coworker/,1690357953.0,1.0

"""dad bods"" versus ""fit"" is extremely dependent My actual question is what makes a ""dad bod"" attractive to you versus a man who is in great shape? Not a body builder. Not a man with bulging muscles or ultra defined abs. But just a dude who is in good shape overall and his body proves it.

WARNING: I like to write and get too detailed sometimes but like to give as much info as possible! This is also going to sound super narcissistic but it is what it is so judge me if you want! ;)

I'm curious because I, as a man (mid 30s,) have one which is entirely due to beer and pad thai lol. So I have a belly but it's not what you imagine. It's there. It's obvious if I want it to be. Overall I LOOK macular and in shape/athletic. Technically I'm overweight for my height (5'10"") but enough to carry a ""dad bod."" It's incredibly interesting how like 95% of women literally don't care. 

Ok, minus the belly/dad bod I do have a very very attractive face so that probably helps... But I've never had issues dating, hooking up, etc... with women who are petite, super athletic/fit, or skinny and objectively ""hot"" or gorgeous by society ""standards,"" despite me clearly being out of shape. I do have a very charming, flirty and funny personality so I suppose that also helps but, you'd think a 5'5"" 120lb super fit woman would want nothing to do with a 5'10"" 210lb guy who is obviously out of shape lol. Apparently that's not the case - at least for me.

I was blessed with amazing genes, both physically (especially physically) and mentally/academically - CompSci from MIT if you are - so, I've *always* been super naturally muscular and just have an ultra athletic build. Extra weight or not. I carry it extremely well. So maybe it's just my genes/natural physique, idk... but I'm far from in shape or ""muscular"" now but I still *look* like I am. I know that doesn't make any sense but I have a dad bod 100% lol. So I guess you could say a muscular in shape looking dad-bod?

Anyways, I have lurked on all the dating sub reddits here for a long time and one thing that people always say to men struggling with women is ""go to they gym,"" ""lose weight"" ""lower your standards,"" etc... which is always a GREAT idea! But, that's not IMO the solution to being successful with women. It'll likely attract more women but, then again I'm some dude with a beer belly and I do just fine! If I lost 10-15 pounds then idk what I'd do with women.

So, what and/or why do you like ""dad-bods?"" What makes them attractive to you?",Former-Corner-4446,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159u96u/dad_bods_versus_fit_is_extremely_dependent/,1690342191.0,0.75

"Bf was unfaithful once, I don‚Äôt know what to do. Looking for advice Not sure if it‚Äôs the right place to post this but here it goes, 
My bf (31m) and I (24f) have been together for 2 years, long distance. I found nudes of a woman in his deleted album when he left his phone unlocked downstairs one night. (Not proud that I snooped) I know he didn‚Äôt take them himself because we had an app that tracks locations at all times and he was never suspicious. He told me that it was a woman he used to sext on WhatsApp a year before we started dating (she lives in another country). He never heard from her until that night when she told him that she visited the States and he responded. Then she said to him, ‚Äú I have a gift for you.‚Äù, the nudes were followed. He said their convo last for a duration of 8 hours (with a total of roughly 15 text messages since he works at night). He admitted sending selfies back to her but realized right after what he did was wrong and shut it down - deleted everything (chat and photos) and went to bed. WhatsApp has a feature that saves photos to album it not turned off manually. 

I‚Äôm contemplating on what to do next, I want to forgive him but tell me if I‚Äôm being naive: 
- it‚Äôs been over 8 months since it‚Äôs happened and his story has never changed. 
- He‚Äôs also got rid of all social media and messaging apps.
- Reassumes me that he‚Äôs 100% faithful to me. 
- What I can‚Äôt quite give through is that he sent selfies back to her, though he immediately realized what he did was wrong. 
I want to move past this because he‚Äôs shown great effort since the very beginning of our relationship, and still does. His work is hectic and he always prioritizes spending time with me. He said that he made a terrible mistake, but he corrected himself right after and shut it down, never let it happen again. He told me that he‚Äôs grateful for this incident because it‚Äôs shown him that he was weak at the moment and lost sight of who he is, and that he needed to be better. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know.. I‚Äôve never been betrayed before. I want to believe that people make mistakes and learn from them, but I hope I‚Äôm not being too naive.

"How To Date in Career Limbo? For context I am a 23 yr old who graduated college last year, casually ""dated"" in the past, but no long term relationships. In general I have not been focused on finding a partner as I was always busy with the pre-med-life. I applied to med school last year, and received no acceptances, I plan to apply again and I would be 25 by the time I start. I feel pretty insecure about my situation, which comes from a lot of internal feelings of failure and anxiety regarding med school and my place in the future due to the uncertainty that comes with applying.

I feel like it's affecting me and how I feel in regards to dating. In general I find it hard to get past this idea that someone would find me a suitable partner, when many individuals my age (and in my dating rage) have an actual career or are more established in life (or will be). I know that from past experiences on dates that most people haven't seemed to concerned with it, but it's personally hard to get past.

"Is he (24m) still interested in me (23f)? I (23f) met this guy (24m) at a party. We ended up hooking up. Prior to that, I disclosed that I was hsv positive.

"What can I do to improve my dating life? Hello. I am a 20-year-old straight guy who's super frustrated with my dating life. It feels like every time I am interested in or find a girl attractive I either get rejected or get led on. I wholeheartedly believe that I am attractive and have been told by many of my friends (guys and girls) for the past couple of years that I am handsome, smart, funny, and overall a catch, but it just doesn't seem that the girls I am interested in ever give me the time of day. FWIW, I am just over 6 feet tall, have straight white teeth (never needed braces or anything), have clear skin (I literally have been doing a 15-minute skincare routine every single night before going to bed since I was 18), and I also believe that I am generally a sociable person. I have very good hygiene and have been told many times by several of my friends and family that I smell good and dress well. I have been working out a TON over the last couple of years trying to level up and have put on a good amount of muscle compared to when I was 17. Working out has significantly improved my mental health and self-worth, but it just sucks knowing in the back of my head that I'm so frustrated with my dating life and that I am always lonely. It feels like I am never enough.  
The thing that is frustrating is that literally every time I see and approach a cute girl I always get the same old ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""Sorry, I'm not looking for that right now"". It's especially sad and makes me miserable because I've been rejected so many times that 95 % of the time when I hear something like this nowadays I can see straight thru the BS in the sense that these women are just trying to let me off easy by making up an excuse. I feel that I am very selective in the girls that I approach (I make sure that they seem single I know that you can't always tell if you just see a girl in public, but I've gotten good at figuring it out for the most part and I also try to make eye contact prior to approaching them), but I am still shooting my shot a lot so it's not like the sample size is small. For reference, this month (July 2023) I can literally think of 27 different girls that I have cold approached and only gotten 2 numbers from those interactions. And those two numbers led to me just being ghosted right off the bat (no response to my first ""Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from \[where we met\]"" text). It's just overly frustrating going through this never-ending cycle and just thinking about it makes me feel miserable. I'll use my latest cold approach as an example. I saw a super attractive girl at my gym yesterday, so I made eye contact with her briefly when I first saw her. Then, later on in my workout I went to the water fountain and was passing by her (we were walking past each other) and I pulled out my earbuds and struck up a quick conversation with her. The conversation was fine nothing out of the ordinary just basic gym small talk, and I maintained eye contact the entire time. After about 45 seconds of chatting, I said something along the lines of, ""Well, I've gotta head out soon it was nice talking to you. I'd like to get to know you better, may I get your number?"" To which she hit me with the dreadful, ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend."" I am basically positive that this girl is single. Also, there was nothing in the conversation that could have shown me that she was not interested. She was making eye contact the entire time. Her body language was more open and facing toward me (all the Youtube videos I've watched aimlessly hoping to fix my dating life have always talked about this), and she asked me a question or two in the conversation which I thought maybe meant she was at least interested in getting to know me at the very least. I guess she was just being friendly. I go into these approaches feeling confident almost like the mentality that ""this girl would be honored to have a piece of this"", but it just doesn't seem to make a difference in the outcome. By the way, the confidence isn't faked. I have genuinely been feeling very confident and comfortable in my skin, especially over the past few years. However, it just eats at me on the inside that I am lonely and not able to secure a date with a girl that I find attractive. Literally, all I want is a chance to get to know and take a girl I find attractive out on a date.  
One thing I haven't mentioned yet that's always been in the back of my mind is that I am of Indian descent. I was born, raised, and currently live in the United States. The girls I am interested in the most part are white girls and maybe some Latinas here and there. I don't know why, but those are really the only girls that I find attractive. Does this have anything to do with my experiences? I feel that anytime I flirt with an Indian girl they are almost always interested, but I can't ever seem to get that level of interest in the girls I am attracted to (white girls). Is there anything I can do about this? I've been constantly told by my white friends (guys and girls) that my race doesn't matter and that girls don't really care, but it's really hard for me to believe that with my experiences. I just feel miserable especially because I always see shorter, less attractive white guys having no problem in dating the girls I find attractive.  
Several months ago, my family and I went to the west coast for vacation (Arizona area), and I was getting significantly more matches with girls I found attractive than I ever had back home. Is it maybe where I live that could be the problem? Maybe these white girls I'm approaching all the time have some racism instilled in them still. Is that what's up? I always thought being in the 21st century that racism would be a thing of the past. Is that really the case though?  
I can anticipate all of the comments saying that I may be coming off as too desperate and needy, but I can guarantee you that is not the case. I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, this guy is just not self-aware."" I promise you that I am not putting a relationship on a pedestal. In fact, my goal for my twenties is to level myself up and build my career. However, I am still extremely frustrated with my results in the sense that I want to improve my game so that I can someday have what I desire. It's just really messing with my head, and I need an outsider's perspective on how to fix it.  
I am not expecting you all to solve my dating woes, but I would really appreciate any feedback you all have for me. I have decided that I am going to continue leveling myself up in the gym, career-wise, etc. in the meantime, but at the end of the day, I would really love to find someone that I am attracted to share it all with.

"girlfriend(22f) seems fond of my friend (21m) and friend seems interested in my gf lol I (22m) went to a chill house party with my girlfriend(22f) and my friend(21m) from uni. girlfriend met him for the first time. my girlfriend found him funny. she told me multiple times throughout the night that he is very funny. which I know, otherwise I wouldn't be his friend innit. I'm not trying to be a hater but she even laughed at jokes that weren't funny. a proper laugh too not a ""oh let's give a polite laugh to not make it awkward"" we went to get McDonald's cos we we're hungry. I was waiting for mine and my gfs order and she went to go sit down w my friend. they sat across from eachother and spoke about whatever I'm not sure. we were eating and we spoke career and taxes and being there for our kids vs working away from home and not seeing the kids for some months. (we both don't have kids it was just a hypothetical topic for when we have kids in the future). we spoke a bunch but my gf cut me off a few times while I was adding to the conversation. usually when she does this she at least comes back to me and apologizes and asks what I had said. but this time she was  blatant abt it . and just carried on the convo w my friend. I also recall my friend saying something abt me only having 2 friends (not sure how it got there, but it lowkey seemed like he tried putting me down now that I think of it) then my gf added to it by saying ""yeh the only two friends are sitting at this table"". I found  it funny but saw it as a v weird remark at the same time from both, my gf esp. they both laughed ofc. I could be overthinking it bcs it was a low blow and it probably was just banter but I didn't make fun of anyone at the table I was chilling. I didn't think too much of all of it. but I definitely took note. 

later at the place I recall him saying something along the lines of ""don't let me steal your girl away"" not those words exactly but it had a similar 'oomf'. was very weird I just looked and ignored what he said.  my gf was right next to me too so I'm sure she heard it too but she said nothing abt it. didn't expect her to in that moment, but I kinda expected her to bring it up the next day. but ig she didn't find that as weird as I did.

I wasn't phased by it that night, cos I couldn't care less. ik where my gf stands w me. even if I caught my friend looking at my gf every now and then lol.

But td out the blue my gf asks me
 ""what does 'friends name' think of me?""
I reply ""why do you care lol""
""nah I don't care""
""then why are you thinking abt it?""
""i meant to say, 'what does he think of me for you?'""
""idk"" 
she went to sleep after my reply 

this part is probably not much to think of but it's what made me make this post to see what you experts think of this situation.

Do u think it wise to bring this up to my girlfriend or will it make me seem insecure?

is this normal on relationships? it's it something you just have to get over?

why do ppl take digs at me when I haven't treated then abt such way?

yes i dont have many friends and this is kinda why lol

"Am I the asshole? I cheated on my boyfriend and we got back together. My boyfriend, james, and I have been dating a little over a year now. So to explain the situation, I have been doing substances such as marijuana and alcohol for many years, I do it to relieve stress and it‚Äôs become a habit for when I‚Äôm upset, or just anytime I crave it. My boyfriend is a religious guy, and is extremely against the use of these substances. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even consider them human‚Äù-James
When my boyfriend and I met, I knew straight away that I liked him and he knew straight away that he loved me, I chose to attempt to quit alcohol and marijuana for him to keep us together. 
Although, I quit the substances for a month, and I ended up doing the substances without his knowledge for the next 2 months. I continued to lie to him and tell him that I was not doing it in order to save our relationship, because if he knew he would break up with me. Though a big part of this lie was because I was struggling very much and I felt that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand where I was coming from if I did start these substances again, we never hangout, we basically have a long distance relationship because of his strict parents, so I didn‚Äôt have the full support I needed to get past my issue. my sister had died and I was the one to preform CPR on her, then my dad abandoned me leaving me with my grandmother is what caused me to start again.  
After a rough argument with James, I decided to go to a party with my friends without his knowledge. At this party I got blackout drunk and kissed another girl in a game of spin the bottle(I am a straight female), somebody at the party recorded the video and sent it to James. I apologized profusely, and I still do till this very  day, and I feel so horrible for it. The next day he broke up with me and I had a seizure, the next Monday I went to school and brought weed and got suspended, then I moved out of the town to live with my mom. 

We talked everyday for 3 weeks and then decided to get Back together, the reason he got back with me was because he still loved me and he didn‚Äôt want me to attempt suicide again, start marijuana and alcohol, and because of my seizure. I feel that this whole situation has helped our relationship grow so much now, we are both completely open with each other, and I actually have quit the substances now. 

Though, throughout our whole entire relationship I‚Äôve been suspicious of one girl in his friends group, Amy(he used to like her and they are around each other more than him and I were, plus she looked exactly like me). James would tell me every little interaction that they had, it was obvious flirting but he continued to deny that he liked her.
Months after James and I started to date again, we were texting all night, then suddenly Amy texted him and asked James to come over and cuddle and stuff. James left our conversation to go talk with her, during their talk he called me because I was angry and said I was going to sleep, but he continued to text her. I then hung up the phone to see how long it took him to choose me. After a good 30 minutes, he texted me having a panic attack, so I called him to make sure he was safe and okay, he told me that they had both confessed their feelings to each other, and told me that he did like Amy too. He asked me if I wanted him to block Amy, I said it was his choice who he really wants here so it was up for him to decide that, 2 days later he blocked her.

I have no idea what I did wrong or even just what happened??

I‚Äôve been talking to this guy (30 and I‚Äôm 28F) for a couple of weeks, we had met up twice prior, had a brief date the first time and made out for a while the second time. 

He continued messaging me and flirting with me, usually he‚Äôd message me first. I‚Äôd tried to get the hookup going once or twice but there were scheduling conflicts and once he cancelled on me rather suddenly but hey, it‚Äôs casual and nbd right?

Then yesterday he‚Äôs chatting with me and sweet talking to me, cool. Like I said this is a casual thing, he‚Äôs only visiting my town, so a purely physical relationship is what I anticipated. Just to be clear on my ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù here. 

He asks if I want him to come over last night around 11, I say yes. Literally 20 minutes later, after he said he was getting in the car, he messaged me saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt come sorry‚Äù and then he blocked me on messenger????

I am so confused. I didn‚Äôt invite him over, he asked ME, so I have no clue why he‚Äôd ghost me or block if he was interested? I would legit understand it more if we‚Äôd already hooked up, like oh I guess he got what he wanted‚Äîbut he literally blocked me BEFORE he got what he wanted? All he got out of me was the making out and then one slightly racy photo, not even a nude. 

Anyone have insight??? I am absolutely thrown rn.",cinnamonspiderr,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1599p65/blocked_less_than_an_hour_before_hooking_up/,1690294389.0,0.81

"I hated my first date I went on my very first date a week before I left campus for summer break. I met the guy on Bumble and after a couple days of talking he asked me if I wanted to hang out at his apartment. I didn‚Äôt think it was weird since his apartment was near my dorm and we went to the same university. However, I wasn‚Äôt able to go the day he wanted me to since I had some finals that week, so I asked him if he wanted to go to one my favorite restaurants nearby the week after. He said sure, and I planned a whole day for us. I planned out the place to eat, the trail we would go on a walk on and watching a movie afterwards. He agreed to everything. 
We set a date to meet on a Friday, a week after he asked me to come over. I was really excited, I did my hair, I wore nice clothes and wore pretty jewelry. I was also so nervous because we texted for two weeks and he seemed like such a chill guy I thought I might be too much for him so I calmed myself down when he texted, telling me he was downstairs, waiting in the lobby of my residence building. When I went downstairs I was immediately disappointed. Not about his looks, since he looked exactly like his pictures, but his attitude and mannerisms. I tried to talk to him, I started off by saying ‚Äúhi, it‚Äôs nice to meet you‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah you too‚Äù but he started walking away. I think he expected me to follow him, but I was the one who knew where the restaurant was so it was just awkward. 
We did end up walking and making small talk on the way to the restaurant and I asked him if he still wanted to the get the special menu item because I was looking forward to seeing him eat it after texting about it. He said yeah but as soon as we order he gets mac and cheese balls and fried chicken. He tells me that he‚Äôll pay for his meal and I could pay for mine and I said that‚Äôs fine, but then I remembered that I was the one who recommended to eat here so I felt like I should pay. We ate and I listened to him talk for most of the time, and eventually he was ‚Äúdone eating‚Äù. I think he took about 3 bites of his food and was ready to throw it away. I told him that the server could give him a to-go box but he said he didn‚Äôt need it and just threw it away. Wasting food is a pet peeve of mine and I wanted to leave. 
I was annoyed at that point and needed to clear my head so I asked him if he wanted to go on a walk. He seemed like he was getting restless and he kept saying ‚Äúmaybe we should just go straight to my place to watch that movie‚Äù. I really just wanted to go on a walk so I told him we could go after. We walked for a bit and he kept telling me what he would do with other girls he went on dates with, like sexual experiences he had with them. Then he asked me if I was on birth control or if I have sex and if I meet guys regularly. I thought these were weird questions because I wasn‚Äôt even on that topic. 
He decided that he wanted to head back but I realized how uncomfortable I was so I asked him if I could get back to my dorm to change. I was wearing a cardigan with a deep v-neck and I just thought I should change into a crew neck since it covered me more. After I changed, he told me we should start heading to his place to watch the movie. I told him we could watch the movie here, since in my residence floor we had a lounge area and nobody was in there. He insisted we go to his place and I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to say no. 
I ended up going and got to his place. I automatically felt uneasy. I felt a little better when I realized he had four roommates and they all seemed to be home. He opened the door to his room and it was filthy. Food all over the desk and ground, wrappers, notebooks and pencils all over. Nothing was in place but surprisingly, his bed was made. He laid down and told me to come cuddle with him. I felt very weird so I just sat up on the bed next to him so he sighed and ended up sitting too. He started the movie and he had his arm around me, he was playing with my hair and caressing my neck but I just didn‚Äôt like it. I felt his arm on my back and I felt like I was hurting his arm so got up to ask if I was. He said no and suddenly asked me if I wanted to make out with him. I said no not right now. He said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, I respect women.‚Äù I thought he was being weird because he didn‚Äôt act like this when we were in public. He kept touching me, around my thigh and shoulder but I made sure nothing else happened. I ended up staying through the whole movie and he made a joke at the end. I didn‚Äôt hear or understand what he said so I asked him. He just said never mind but he sounded angry. Eventually, he told me he would walk me to the bus stop. At the end I asked him if he had fun, he said yeah, and I asked him what he thought of me. He said he thought I was hot‚Ä¶ finally the bus came and I left. 
I decided to get off the bus after a couple stops. I walked the rest of the way and got back to my dorm and cried. I was so frustrated with myself for wasting a day that I could‚Äôve spent alone. I felt like I was baby sitting the entire time in public but scared to say the wrong thing when I was at his place. I tried to keep an open mind but I don‚Äôt want to see him again.",Rice360,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159qhy6/i_hated_my_first_date/,1690331795.0,1.0

"Ex initiated contact after I went NC and then left me on read I dated this girl for more than a year. We‚Äôre both in our late twenties. We behaved like a couple, though we never committed - mainly because she didn‚Äôt want to. We distanced each other and she started treating me like her last option, but she didn‚Äôt want to lose me either. I got tired of the situation and told her not to speak to me again, at least during some months. She understood and agreed.

Fast forward 10 days, and she replies to my instagram story with a sad emoji - to which I reply something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong? Do you miss me?‚Äù She read it, but hasn‚Äôt replied.

Honestly, I‚Äôm quite angry. It was already challenging for me to cut her off, and then she does this kind of stuff. Not only does she disrespect my boundaries, but then leaves me on read? Is this a power play? Because she‚Äôs always been quite honest and mature in her communication. However, now I‚Äôm doubting everything she‚Äôs done in the past. It baffles me.

"Anyone else tired of the excessive location bullshit on dating apps? I'm so tired of literally being FORCED to put my location on every single time I use the app. Like just fuck off already. You already have my fuckin location; save it and use it. 

I understand all the excuses about ""it's like this because there's so many catfish accounts""... it doesn't make it any better. If humans could quit acting so shitty where they need to constantly spam and scam everyone, everywhere, all the time, then this wouldn't be an issue. 

Two of the biggest culprits I'm seeing atm with this are Tinder and Bumble. But shits definitely on other apps too. Shit even apps that AREN'T dating apps are forcing locations (like weather apps). 

Just let people choose their damn location. Quit forcing me to turn location on just to simply USE the app for anything. I sidestep these apps on purpose but when they're the predominant apps people use, it isn't really possible just not trying it. 

Again, like I said, I understand why they do it, but they shouldn't HAVE to do it. 

And then all these apps and their bullshit subscriptions. Like quit putting everything behind a damn paywall. Everything is a way to capitalize/profit from you nowadays and it's ridiculous. I will never, ever pay for a damn dating app and honestly NOBODY should. It shouldn't even be a thing. If people quit falling into their exploitive practices, and didn't just toss away money every opportunity they have, maybe these companies would finally see that and change could happen. 

Not every single thing on earth needs to become a subscription. Quit exploiting people's loneliness and desperation for your own profit. It's ridiculous more people don't see this. Or care. 

Lol you can't even see the people that liked you on these apps without paying and that's literally redundant to the whole point of dating. Same with the apps that prevent you from simply messaging. It's ridiculous. These companies honestly don't deserve a cent from people ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Dating At 28? I turned 28(M) and last I had dated was around 21 - 22 which was 2 months which ended bad and then I just bounced back to focus on my career around 2 years I focused on that and built it up, then I was thinking to date but then covid came and coz of negativity on going I had to deal with anxiety and also work was affected so my focus went to work and health and thats how just I turned 28.  
So, from last 5yrs I have been 0 social not met anyone coz usually I used to just chat with business and friends also online, not meeting in person.  
Now I am just working on getting the social life back but coz of my past anxiety in these 3 years that time it was on health anxiety coz of covid and news, but then it shifted to now from last 3 - 4 days on relationships and it just gave me tons of weird thoughts of like 28 is too late, a bit regret feeling on wasting last 5yrs, but actually when I talked with 1 friend who broke up he was like he regrets that relationship of wasting time and money lol.  
Right now coz of no social life my routine has been bad too like sleep in day wake up afternoon / evening, I guess that's the main cause of anxious feeling sometimes and these thoughts.

"How to move on after ex (22f) broke up with me (23m) after proposing to me and making me travel across the world to be with her I (23m) dated my now-ex girlfriend (22f) for 2 years, and we had a wonderful relationship in my eyes filled with love, partnership and we really cared for each other, our only weak point was communication, but we were working on it steadly and improvements were showing.

after a while together, I moved countries for her, leaving behind my friends and family. I had also found a job and started working hard, I came from poverty but managed to save 100k ‚Ç¨ to eventually buy a house for us. I honestly saw myself in the long term future having a life with her and she always motivated me to be better.

don't get me wrong, i was far from perfect, i'm not the tidiest guy around, and stress sometimes turned me into a grumpy moster, but i was working on improving my shit.

my communication improved a lot since the beginning of the relationship, as well as my ability to talk about my feelings, which I had never been able to do before and i was seeing really good improvement.

the first time she broke up with me was 6 months ago, after which she went wild on tinder while I fell into a deep depression and was the worse i've ever been before specially since i was left alone in a country i had no one ( this made a bit harder for me to take her back due to the pain she caused me but i ended up forgiving her ).

a couple weeks after the first breakup, she moved in with a friend of hers who had a crush on her and said she realized she had made a mistake and wanted to give us another chance.

i took her back and we were having an awesome time after getting back together, and I tried my best to fix the problems that caused her to leave, but it is stuff that takes time, and I again was honestly seeing a lot of improvements on my end.

within 2 months of us getting back together, she proposed to me and I accepted, we got engaged, i started working harder to build the future i saw with her.

two months after she proposed to me, she went to visit her parents in Singapore and invited me (almost begged) for me to come.

the trip was really not ideal, i knew it would be a bit stressful cause work was piling up, but I wanted to be there for her specially since it was something she valued (her past). i sacrificed my plans and work. but as soon as i got there it was totally different than what she said, it was tense, and we barely had any time together.

we only spent 7 days out of the 13 days I was there together, which was a bummer for me since she was begging me to be with her. Towards the end of the trip, she broke up with me, saying she wanted to move back with her parents (I assume she enjoyed being a child again instead of having responsibilities). (she mentioned she liked having stuff made for her such as her parents making her dentist appointments and stuff like that).

on top of that she blamed me for everything, not cleaning the house, working a lot, not listening to her and being toxic, and she said i wasnt worth it.

i need some help seeing if i'm really that horrible, i indeed got angry with her from time to time and we had some heated arguments in topics we didn't see eye to eye and could've done a better job cleaning the house but that was it and it was stuff i was working on.

i just got a 6 figures job offer with relocation to switzerland but I know I can't accept it, i don't want to move to another country and be lonely and even more depressed, I even had to quit the projects i'm currently working on.  


i completely hate myself right now and blame myself for everything wrong that has happened, i haven't been able to live lately and can't stop thinking about her, how do i just forget all of this and move on specially after all i wanted in the future was this woman and building a life with her.",JohnnyCampello,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15994ig/how_to_move_on_after_ex_22f_broke_up_with_me_23m/,1690293054.0,0.94

"As a man, what should I have learned from the Barbie movie? *spoilers* So I did Barbieheimer. Well I should say I did Oppenharbie, since I saw oppenheimer first. 

I went into barbie with an open mind. I knew it was going to be from a female perspective. I knew they were probably not going to portray men in a flattering way. I knew that I probably would not get the kind of catharsis I typically do. And it sort of fulfilled that. But I did enjoy it. The funny parts were funny, and I loved Ryan Gosling and Will Farrell especially. 

My own takeaway from this movie is that Greta Gerwig totally doesn't get what men want. To her, we can find fulfillment in masculine things like horses and sports. And we want women to be brainless, because we sort of are. In the real world, because we live in a patriarchy (and I'm not saying we aren't), society is set up for my success . And it sort of is. I do have a good career and I can feel safe in public spaces, so I will recognize that advantage. 

But the one thing I think I want is the love of a woman. And, in the movie, that is what Ken wanted, except his character arc ended with him realizing that he needed to be complete on his own.

"30 Jewish lesbian...considering saving sex for marriage... Hello! So...so far I have limited sexual experience; I've only had one girlfriend and we didn't go all the way because of her previous history of abuse; this was nearly a decade ago and haven't had any sort of intimacy with anyone since (also, had a painful childhood and teen years and healing from that as well as putting myself through Engineering school have been my priority).  
I've always known that my ideal and what feels most satisfying to me personally is having sex only with the person I'll marry (waiting till we're officially engaged or even till marriage); but for most of my life I've felt it's unrealistic and that persevering in that will mostly lead to frustration/resentment. I feel very alone in this and would love to discuss it with other people, especially if Jewish and/or gay (heterosexual and non-religious or people from other religions are also welcome).  
Also, I worry that women might discard me for my now intentional lack of experience or compare me to exes etc.  
Perhaps the most balanced option is having sex only in long-term relationships (waiting for at least a year before doing it etc).  
The purpose of this post is to find people that relate or in general discuss it to help me decide what I'll do in the future.

"I feel like he‚Äôs taking too long to make it official I (26 F) have been dating this guy (46 M) for almost 8 weeks now. We‚Äôve seen each other every week since and the last 3 weekends, I‚Äôve spend consecutive nights over his house.

We go on dates all the time, he‚Äôs met my parents, and we communicate almost every day. I feel like his girlfriend, but we haven‚Äôt made it official nor do we even talk about a relationship/future together.

Neither of us is seeing anyone else and I brought up the, ‚ÄúWhat are we?‚Äù conversation, although we were interrupted by something important and said we‚Äôd resume it later. He says that he sees it going in the relationship direction, but I‚Äôm a little frustrated that although he‚Äôs consistent and treats it like a relationship, he hasn‚Äôt taken the initiative to commit.  

I don‚Äôt like the idea of having to be the one to push that conversation. A part of me feels as though I‚Äôm wasting my time because most men (in my experience) express what they want without me prompting it and want to lock things down. 

Am I overthinking it or does it sound odd to anyone else? Should I bring up the conversation again, or wait until he does?

"Me (22M) feels happy but unsure after a date with female (20F) Today me 22M went on a date with 20F. We met on tinder and have been texting alot and talked once on phone for the past week. Today we had our first physical date which from my experience went really good. We had lunch and afterwards went to a park where we sat and talked, we clicked quickly and then talked about a little bit of everything even certain stuff that are more private.

On the date we held hands, walked around the city and kissed around 4x times. When the day was over and it got late we said goodbye and kissed one more time before she drove off. She seemed just as happy with the date as I was so I went home with what I thought was a good feeling (the whole date lasted 5 whole hours)

Problem: when I got home I sent her a snap and asked if she wanted to have a second date and she said yes!!! BUT... she then added that she was unsure of her feelings, at first I thought it was just normal since it was the first date after all and I answered that its fine with me if we take it slow but... the more I thought about it the more worried I became...

Between all of our discussions we had today I remember her quickly mention her ex (not a good sign I know but it was subtle and quick) apparently they had broken up around 6 months ago in December which is kind of long time to be single IMO so I doubt I am a rebound after that long time?? She also mentioned she had been having some short lived encounters with other guys during the last months that did not last, just as I had unfortunate encounters with other girls that did not click during the same time. 

So my question: is this a red flag? It was only the first date after all but I like this girl and I am not sure if I should invest more thoughts and feelings onto her if she can not (or do not want to) respond the same?

I could also be overreacting because she wanted a second date with me and I am pretty sure she enjoyed my company and I am still on her contact lists... I have decided to give her some space today and not write to her as much as we usually do but: if you were me and chose to keep trying to invest in her, how would you do it?

"When a woman says ""I'm not looking for anything right now because I just got out of long-term relationship"", is it true? Hi, just looking for some advice because I'm a little confused right now. I met this girl at a festival and we basically spent the whole night dancing and making out. We didn't go further because I had plans to take her on a date sometime later. 

However, I messaged her today and she said ""I'm not looking for anything right now because I just got out of long-term relationship"". I just wonder if she tries to put me down gently or is it actually true? I remember the ""Brad Pitt rule"" and I guess she would go on the date regardless of the situation if she really liked me?

"Why do girls like a little belly on their man??? Not trying to brag here, but by many accounts I'm quite a fit, good-lookin' dude. However I'm not Olympic athlete level fit. I have a little bit of a belly and love-handles. I've always been a little self-conscious about it and I'm working on losing that last little bit of fat.

HOWEVER every girl I've ever been with, including my current gf, have all either indirectly or directly said they love my belly/love handles. They tell me I'm so hot even though I don't have those chizzled abs that models and famous actors do. Whenever I talk about wanting to lose weight and get rid of the belly/love handles they are always genuinely distressed and say things like ""nooo! I love your little belly!"" Or ""I don't want you to lose too much weight."" and etc.

I really want to understand this. How/why do girls find this attractive? What is it about a little bit of belly on a guy that girls find so attractive? And wouldn't any girl be happy to see their bf work on himself and get more and more fit? I have heard of the notion of the bf being super fit triggering self-confidence issues and such. I can understand that somewhat - Sometimes I look at my gf who is just so hot and it makes me wonder could someone so attractive really chose me? - But is there more to it?

Edit: This has been really informative and helpful. I think I might finally be able to feel more comfy in my own skin (or body as it were), finally being able to rest in the notion that there's more than one type of body that women find attractive. I guess I'm that ""husky"" or ""hardy"" kindof body that makes women feel safe and comfy. :)",mapleflavrd,354,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/158hqr3/why_do_girls_like_a_little_belly_on_their_man/,1690221087.0,0.84

She was a mother of 2, literally just starting to date 5-years after her divorce. I am a single, childless professional, who is likely to move to another country in 18months.

The last 6 weeks have been great. We just went on a 3-day holiday together. At the end of the holiday, I think she‚Äôs become uneasy with the fact that I probably will move away. I cannot guarantee whether I will or I won‚Äôt, neither can I say if I‚Äôll come back.

This happened 6 months ago. Another woman I dated developed feelings for me. And instead of seeing where it goes, they dropped me because I can‚Äôt guarantee where I‚Äôll be in (then 2 years).

I feel guilty of sorts that I am causing my current gf sadness. I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. All I want is to be present with her and make her happy. I hate to think that she‚Äôs currently deep-in-thought and in doubt.

It makes him unhappy and I was begging and begging to the point where i feel like I'm just holding someone who wants to leave...

Eventually things got into way and he has no energy for me as much, but he has for others and it hurt so much that i became anxiously attached.
Since i started asking for more time and after he promised to do so, he suddenly requested we see each other less often. 
It was not what i was used to ans it got me worried.

We play the same sports, are both involved in the same \*sport community, studied the same program at the same college, we work for the same company by coincidence, and overall we have a lot in common . \*I won't say what sport or college program I think it'll give me away just incase lol\*

However, at a recent \*sport\* competition, my friend pointed out that everytime we passed by him he was always hanging out with girls.

I follow him on IG and noticed that he's always liking posts of girls with a certain aesthetic. Pretty girly girls, asian influencers. (eg. SandyDianaBang, Helen Peng) I like following these girls too, but because I like the way they dress too and I wanna know what makeup they're using. But it's like he's the only guy to pop up on nearly ALL these girl's posts. A LOT.

The few thoughts that come up are like ""Wow. He's girl crazy."" ""He likes this type of girl huh?""

What do y'all think? Is it not a huge deal, or is he a ""Wear My Hug At?"" type of guy. Is he girl crazy cus he wants his pick of the best? To understand the female brain?

He's super popular in our \*sport community. Everyone loves him, and have said he's super sweet. I've chatted with him a few times too and yeah, he has golden retriever energy. But someone has said before that he seems to be girl crazy.

"Interested in someone asexual So sorry if this is all over the place but I tend to overthink things, but also want to keep it vague as it wouldn't surprise me if they're on reddit.
So as the title says I'm interested in someone that is asexual. They've consistently surprised me at every turn at how much we have in common, I think they're absolutely beautiful, and frankly they're an all around amazing person. I could sing their praises all day, but it may just be me being infatuated with them. I don't read people incredibly, or even mildly, well. Most people I've dated in the past have been VERY direct, like grabbing my junk and let's get it on, direct. Being asexual, they wouldn't do that. We've cuddled, and held hands, but it's not like they haven't shown that kinda affection to others around us, not quite to the degree they have with me, but it has me guessing, are they interested in me, or are they just that open with their friends?
I just want to date this person as of right now. My past experience says go for it they're interested, they probably want to jump your bones but are holding back because they're waiting on you to make a move. But again, they're asexual, so they don't get those... urges.
I need advice about what's the best way to talk about this with them, without risking the friendship we have going? Or are they just cuddly but not interested in me, so don't read too much into it(?)

"Expecting guys to pay on a first date and low effort men? (Rant) I feel that when guys do pay for the first and next few dates of the dating process, it shows me that he has interest in me and gives me the sign that he is willing to be a protective caretaker. Just based off of the family dynamic of my parents, my dad is the breadwinner and works to take care of my mom. My mom has been a stay-at-home mom and rarely works--to be honest, she probably has worked a total of about 2-4 years her whole life. I guess my mom has always raised me to believe that when a guy is willing to pay for things, especially in the beginning, it shows that he is capable of taking care of you and is a reliable man. However, I know that this is a very traditional view and I do think this way of thinking has become an expectation when I go on dates. Don't get me wrong, probably 99% of the guys where I have gone out on dates with will pay for the first date...but I think by them doing that it has made me see it as an expectation and expect him to pay for the next, next, and ongoing dates. I just don't know what I can do to remove this ingrained belief that I have known based on my parent's way of dating. And how should I suggest meeting guys then on a first date where we don't have to spend so much? Also, I noticed that when I initiate guys to meet up for the first time and suggest meeting up again, that is when they get all low effort and put no energy into the connection. I have found some guys on dating apps would just message me for 3-4 weeks and no sign of asking to meet-up; so I was just assuming they were shy so then I ask to meetup and then they either they me they are busy or meetup but then also slow down and not let me know when to meetup again.

"Should i talk to this guy again after he sent me some distressing photos? I hooked up with him after we met through tinder a few months ago. The experience was pretty bad, for a number of reasons, but after that we kept talking because we had some things in common and i overall enjoyed his company (we only saw each other in person once, after that i went overseas). He did like me a lot and even wanted to date but i told him no. I'll mention that he has a ""traditional"" mindset and tends to agree with stuff that Andrew Tate says, but nothing crazy.  
  
Why we fought: one day he was telling me that i need someone like him to protect me, and i told him protect me from what? Then he sent me some stickers on whatsapp, it was some pretty fucked up stuff that i don't want to explain or detail. He told me before that his friends are together in a groupchat where they send each other ""messed up stuff"", but that's it's not necessarily him who engages in that. Seeing that upset me a lot and we stopped talking. He said sorry and when i didnt answer, he blocked me.  
  
Then today he apparently unblocked me and DMed me asking how i am. Deep down i knew i should have just ignored him but i ended up answering him. Now he wants to hang out again...  
  
I'll be honest and say that i am someone that likes getting attention or approval from others, and i find it hard to let go of people even if they haven't been good to me. In this case i just miss having someone to talk to all the time, and i'll also say that it's a general ego boost since i know he likes me.

"Should I confront the guy I‚Äôm dating why he hasn‚Äôt texted me in week? I (24F) started seeing this guy (25M) back in March. There have been a few ups and downs and we live about 4 hours apart. The TLDR is in the last paragraph. The 4th paragraph contains necessary backstory I recommend you read. 

We stopped talking for two weeks late April (I blocked him) because I got mad at him for being angry that his ex/mother of his child hooked up with his friend. I ended up forgiving him.

We saw each other in person in June. He came up the first time to see his family and made time to see me. The second time I visited him and I almost broke it off because he fell asleep on me after we hooked up. I ended up spending the afternoon with his family but we made up.

(Necessary backstory) 
We were supposed see each other 2 weeks ago but a family member he lives with got sick. He hasn‚Äôt came up to see me because he said he doesn‚Äôt have money right now. He recently just switched jobs. 

Ever since he canceled on me I haven‚Äôt heard from him in a week. I called him Sunday night it went to voicemail. I texted Monday morning to see if he was doing well. He struggles with depression on top of having adhd. He recently got on medication for his depression and starting seeing therapy. 

Another important thing to note is earlier this year I told him I was messing around with a friend. Days before I was set to come out, I told him the truth that it was actually my coworker not a friend. I told  him I lied about it because I was embarrassed. I clarified things between us are over and I don‚Äôt want to be with him. He‚Äôs also gotten cheated on the past.  

I know it was wrong to hide that and I apologized. 

Another important thing to note we defined early on we wanted a serious relationship. When I admitted the truth about my coworker we also discussed this again and asked if we‚Äôre heading towards a relationship. 

My question is, should I call/text him to see why he hasn‚Äôt contacted me? I want to text him something like ‚Äúhey I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a week are we still good? I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôre done because I haven‚Äôt heard from you in a week. If so next time do the right thing and at least send a text ending things.‚Äù 

TLDR: the longish distance guy I‚Äôm seeing canceled on me coming out two weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since he canceled on me. I tired reaching out Sunday night and my call went to voicemail and texted the next day day no response. I want to text him to ask why he hasn‚Äôt reached out and if things are done between us.

"Past experiences TW; brief mentions of abuse. Hey there.

I'm beginning to get back out there in the dating world, after my last relationship ended primarily due to an unwillingness to communicate, him being emotionally incestious with his family, and my PMDD definitely played a part I think. 

I also suspect there was some sexual/another kind of infidelity on his side, but it was never confirmed. The signs were there, and I also think that maybe also just had some massive issues dealing with serious past trauma, especially as he just didn't want to communicate, and would rather shut down, and not put any effort in.

He also KNEW my serious past trauma history (DV, and being the victim of multiple types of abuse &amp; assault) when he decided to betray me by using intimacy, to gauge if he felt anything for me anymore, which was essentially the #1 biggest hardest boundary I drew and communicated to him that wasn't to be crossed &amp; was an automatic relationship game over move if it were to happen, when the relationship started.

Now that I am getting back out there and meeting new people romantically &amp; for relationships, I am so scared of mistaking something for loveb---ing, for example, because it's what I've gotten in the past. Like if a guy is just affectionate by nature (eg. golden retriever puppy in human form), I'm nervous I'll mistake it for loveb---ing, and heck things up when they're perfectly good, even after all my relationship trauma therapy, and continuous therapy that I'm going through, &amp; getting.

For example, am talking to a new guy, and we just click, and I'm being wary and careful, while not self-sabotaging. He's flirting, but I think also because I'm on the spectrum, my mind is like 'wtf is this sorcery, and how do I deal with it?!'. I don't know how to respond.

I've dealt with my trauma enough to know that I'm safe to be interpersonally intimate at least with someone again, because I have the presence of mind to try and not let my past traumas actively affect my present relationships (friends, romantic, platonic &amp; everything in between), and to work on the problem behaviours when they come up.

**How do y'all tell the difference between someone just being affectionate (which I'm not super used to, and with my mind doing it's job and trying to keep me safe, it jumps to the worst case scenario immediately), and love-b***ing?**

"And now she wants to be friends So long story short my girlfriend (28F) and I (39M) split properly last week. This was after she split with me but then wanted to get back together on a casual basis. I was happy with that but she kept cancelling dates and coming up with excuses why she couldn‚Äôt see me. I said I couldn‚Äôt do causal that involved only seeing each other for 30 mins every two weeks as I needed more connection. I felt I should be pursuing something else which wasn‚Äôt possible for me if we were involved, so we mutually called it off.

I didn‚Äôt hear from her in 5 days and wasn‚Äôt expecting her to reach out. I felt like it was all done and dusted and I‚Äôve been trying to move on with my life. The weeks and events before the breakup caused me a lot of worry and anxiety, I was glad it was all over tbh and was feeling good about myself again.

"Bf says he ""earned"" a bj and ""needs"" it, but doesn't respect my disgust towards it. **thanks for all the advice** I sat down with him and talked for hours, even continued the conversation to days. It really went amazing and he seemed understanding until he hit me with ""i liked you better when you were 17 and more open"". Immediately broke up with him and found out from his family he's seeing someone new already who is 17 which made them kick him out. I have no further update. I just know they haven't seen him since and i changed the locks on my home and blocked him.
---
My bf (23) and i (21) have been dating for 4 years. In those 4 years he's done ALOT for me and had to deal with my mental health issues. Everytime he did something (small like buy me candy or big like gift me earrings), he ALWAYS says ""i deserve head"" or ""i really earned head"". I came forward and explained my disgust towards giving head and he just hits me with ""it's clean. I haven't peed. I can shower."" or whatever.
Sometimes went so far and said ""but i give u head? how's that fair?"" which i told him, he does because he wants it. Not because i asked/begged for it. I'm at the point where i refuse to let him give me head because he's gonna ask for himself afterwards.
My opinion isn't gonna change on it. It's gross to me and what's worse is, that his ""thing"" smells really f-ing disgusting all the time+he's a cigarette smoker. Just imagine the bad diet.
This begging has turned me off so much that there's no sexual activities going on at all since a few months, which makes him even more aggressive and triggered. He mentioned once that if this isn't gonna change, he can't continue this relationship because he ""needs"" it in his life.
Sometimes he just shoves ""it"" in my face and like i mentioned, it stinks. Happened before in my sleep as well. I don't know what to do anymore. I gotta admit, i myself have no real interest in touching it. Yes, I'm 100% straight. Just no high sex drive and more of a cuddly person.
The relationship overall is amazing. I truly think he's my soulmate and apart from this issue, we match with everything. No serious fights, no disrespect...he cheated 3 times over his phone, but i forgave him, because it was pretty early into the relationship.

"Does being a virgin mean you dont know how to talk to women? A friend of mine who i do not consider a close friend because we just started hanging out this year wanted to go clubbing with me or going to bars. I'm 26 he's about 23 and there's definitely a maturity gap between us. We both agreed that we would be wingmen for each other going out. I've had no sexual experience in my life haven't even kissed a woman. I kind of regret telling him my lack of experience but I thought that if he's a true friend that he'd at least be supportive. 

We decided on going out to a part of town that we 
agreed upon and I told him I'd prefer a low-key place because I'm not really a big extrovert and I'd prefer to talk to people one-on-one or have a more low-key setting like at a speakeasy or some of the lower key type bars in town. He put a lot of pressure on losing my V Card and even went to the extent of saying that I don't know how to talk to women because I am a virgin as if it's some fact. I've explained that I've improved my social skills and that I've been practicing a lot of flirting with women. I personally don't think I don't know how to talk to women but I just haven't had good opportunities to have sexual encounters in my life at this point. I am a bit shy and sometimes I do put myself in positions where I miss opportunities to at least get numbers or express my interest in somebody. While I think I might not have as much experience as other guys obviously,I do think that I shouldn't be putting myself down and think that i can't because if you actually believe that you can't talk to women it's probably going to not go so well. 

I tried to debate with him that manifesting a sexual encounter with a woman is not exactly the same thing as talking to a woman. Obviously trying to gain attraction and respect the other person's boundaries and what they're comfortable with is the first step before trying to create a sexual encounter. I think this guy is more socially awkward than me though at times so I don't really know if he has a place to be arguing a certain point when I don't even know his own sexual experience. Also I think the point of going out is to have a good time , not to try to put pressure on trying to have a sexual encounter. If it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't.

"Is Promiscuity the new normal? How to accept this reality? Edit: Common response is not to judge the book by the cover. I wonder how to judge then? What would signal that woman is actually serious about long term relationship? How to spot a red flag?

Hello folks,
 
I am not trying to be picky on OLD but most women who I find remotely attractive are so sexually provocative in their profiles. I can't swipe right on them. Their profile suggests seeking long term but their pics says otherwise. 

I can't imagine someone in their early 30s would make profile like these if they are seeking a committed relationship. If I have to bet my money they are having casual fun all along but won't mind to settle if someone nice comes their way. 

I am insecure on meeting such women. I don't think I will be able to look past their promiscuous past. I will always think they are settling for me because I was the only loser they could find for commitment. 

Am I stupid for having these thoughts and judging women based on their pics without actually meeting. I am rusty and things might have changed in the past few years. (Out of dating scene for 6 years)

I just need time to deal with this fact that‚Äôs all!!! I love him unconditionally!



I‚Äôm madly in love with my current boyfriend just to state that. 
The story is that, we often joke about having sex in public where everyone can see us, we both know that wont happen in the middle of the day in crowded place, so it was fine until he asked me if I had ever had public sex. I was in shock bc he asked me that but I guess it‚Äôs fine, so i told him I didn‚Äôt (which is true), anyways he was like ‚Äúnoo jokeeess, really??‚Äù, and I was quite surprised. Firstly, I don‚Äôt have much experience with men in general, not to talk about some adventurous activities like that, so i asked him (which I deeply regret) did he had it with some of his exs, and he told me he had it in H&amp;M and in the park. I was stunned. My jaw literally dropped. I was too shocked to talk. 
Just to state, i have nothing against public sex and people who like that kind of stuff, BUT, from my angle, that kind of thing should be done with someone you are in a long relationship (like 3-4 or 5 yrs or more) or with someone you firmly know you gonna stay with. That‚Äôs just how i see things. His longest relationship is with me (3 months now). From what he told me, all his relationships would fall apart after a week or 2 (in the best case) because he was neither serious about them, neither were they. 
So the problem now is, after he told me that, when i look in his eyes, all I see is him, with someone else, in H&amp;M cabin. Last night, and tonight, I can‚Äôt fall asleep without having sex scene in my head where he is with some other girl in H&amp;M. 
Now, people will tell me to talk about this with him, but to be completely honest, I can‚Äôt bare to listen any more about his past experiences with any of his ex girlfriends. I told him that today that I don‚Äôt want to know anymore more about them and if he wants to tell me something about them like a funny story or whatever, to think twice before telling me and if he thinks it‚Äôs the best, just to lie to me. I was, and I am crying myself to sleep.

"How to handle this situation? So I (M25) got to know this girl (F20) from a birthday party a month ago and we talked for a bit (I assume she wanted me to ask her out but I only got the idea in hindsight). She left early but followed me on instagram the next day. I hit her up and asked her out to which she said ‚Äûyes very much‚Äú. 

Not going into many details here. The first date was nice, I brought a blanket and something to eat and we had a good time. We held hands and I kissed her on her forehead but she didn‚Äôt want to make out. No problem for me. The next day she told me how beautiful she thought it was and how she wants to see me again. So for the date I visit her town, we went to the riverside, she baked some cake and shit and it was nice again. After that I noticed that I had missed my train (she lives right next to the station), so I suggest we go wait at her‚Äôs to which she agreed. We listened to lots of music we both happen to like and after an hour I leave. We didn‚Äôt kiss still and I don‚Äôt need to rush things. She has exams going and shit and I have stuff to do, so we didn‚Äôt meet last week but we wanted to meet today. Yesterday though she texts me that she has some issues with her endometriosis and that we can‚Äôt meet today but she‚Äôs already looking forward to next time. I would be in her town today anyway, so I decide to look up some things that might help with her issues, buy that shit and bring it to her together with a card. She opens the door and she was surprised. She said it was cute and she felt speechless and whatever. I leave because I got shit to do and after an hour she texts me again to thank me but also talk to me. 

I call her. She explains how she thought what I did was cute and how nobody ever did something like that for her BUT she doesn‚Äôt see anything beyond friendship and doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on and that she feels bad to do it over the phone and so on. I tell her it‚Äôs ok and that I saw more than that and that I think it would be better if we stopped talking and wished her the best, she accepted. 

Obviously I felt like I had no other choice but I feel crushed. I don‚Äôt know where it all went wrong.

Now that I think about it she said she didn‚Äôt feel well mentally and maybe I overwhelmed her. I just thought she‚Äôd maybe feel better. Is there any hope left for me?",zeidmaschine,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/159g2ul/how_to_handle_this_situation/,1690308425.0,1.0

"Just deleted all dating apps I'm not giving up on dating, I'm just sick of the toxic culture that online dating seems to perpetuate between all sexes and genders. It makes me sick to see how we date now, I was getting matches and nothing of substance was ever talked about, on top of that you have fake accounts that constantly hit me (I'm male) to buy nudes, to get on only fans, to add an insta account, or some sugar daddy bullshit that just makes me physically gag.

Then when you do match with someone legit, it's like talking to a brick wall. For fucks sake I've had better conversations with bots. I'm not saying these people aren't wonderful people looking for something good in their lives but the online dating scene is a sick puppy and doesn't really condone good conversation or getting to know each other. It's a meat grinder for both parties for different reasons.

Almost all my relationships have been found actually talking to someone, not texting or looking at a profile that doesn't allow barely any sort of information regarding the person. Instead it's quick one liners and tags. None of which really builds up to anything remotely needed to decide if I like the person or not.

It's toxic as fuck, and I'm over it. I'd rather wait it out and find someone I mesh well with doing something worth my time and not being detrimental to my opinion of other human beings.",The_Fluffness,1218,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/xxq1v8/just_deleted_all_dating_apps/,1665118491.0,0.96
