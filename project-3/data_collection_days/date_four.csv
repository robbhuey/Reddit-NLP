"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",SyCams,5478,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/es2cek/rdating_is_not_the_place_to_soapbox/,1579646134.0,0.98
"Guy didn't look like his pictures. Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great. 

Seriously, if they don't look like their pictures, just run. If they've been deceptive before you've even met them, of course it's not going to go well! üòÇ",Difficult_Web404,302,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ef1l6/guy_didnt_look_like_his_pictures/,1690807063.0,0.93

"Am I expecting too much from this girl? Backstory, I (M24) have been dating this girl from work (F28) for about a month and a half. We‚Äôve gone on a good number of dates, hangouts, double dates and they have all been great! We really enjoy spending time with each other.

She did explain to me that she has been divorced in the past, so she told me she doesn‚Äôt want to label / define our relationship when I asked what are we. 

That kind of threw me off guard, but we did both explain that we consider ourselves exclusive to the other one. I figured if we‚Äôre exclusive that‚Äôs good enough for me.

We usually see each other about once or twice a week, but lately she‚Äôs just been too busy to see me. 

The problem is, I feel like the relationship isn‚Äôt growing. I get we are exclusive but i have been wanting to get closer with her and spend more time with her. It seems like since she doesn‚Äôt want to label it, or make time for me, it seems like I‚Äôm not that important to her. 

She‚Äôs an amazing person but it seems like she shouldn‚Äôt really be dating as I feel like seeing someone once a week isn‚Äôt too much to ask for.

"Agreeing on 2nd date, not responding afterwards I (M) had a Bumble date yesterday, which I enjoyed a lot. She seemed to enjoy it too and we laughed a lot together as well. We ended the date at the train station, and when we came there saw she had to run to catch the train. No real proper goodbye this, so I just quickly told her I enjoyed it and would like to meet again. She said she thought so too and it came over to me as genuine as well. 

I didnt have her number yet, so messaged her on Bumble repeating I enjoyed it and would like to meet again. 

'Yes would be great'
 Was her exact respond yesterday evening.

I messaged back asking if we had to plan it ahead already, or just wait a bit and see whenever both of us have time in the coming weeks. 

I know one day is not a lot and I'm probably overreacting, but no response yet. 

I've had similar experiences before, where a girl agrees to meet again and then suddenly stops responding, and it honestly makes me crazy and also breaks my self-confidence, hence why I'm tripping now so fast already lol. 
Whenever someone honestly says they do not want to meet again, I don't mind so much, but this truly kind of hurts me....

"Intense anxiety and guilt surrounding doing anything sexual is stopping me from losing my virginity 
I‚Äôm a 25 year old guy who‚Äôs a virgin for reference. I was always an ugly duckling, terrified to flirt because I didn‚Äôt want to be a creep, etc., but I‚Äôm a late bloomer and the last few years I‚Äôve really grown into myself, become a bit more confident and stuff too. I get a good amount of matches on tinder, and I‚Äôve had quite a few women flirt with me more and more recently. Women have approached me in clubs and bars a couple of times, I‚Äôve had women from tinder say they‚Äôre down to hook up and date, my friend told one girl while we were drunk that I was a virgin and she gave me her number and told me to meet her later and she‚Äôd happily ‚Äòteach me a few things‚Äô, etc.

But I can‚Äôt stop getting in my own way. I have this really intense, almost intrusive irrational anxiety about being a creep, violating someone‚Äôs consent, etc., and I don‚Äôt know where it stems from. I think I have such a deep belief that I‚Äôm not sexually attractive that I have this anxious belief that any time someone‚Äôs interested in me, that it can‚Äôt be real, and that I‚Äôd be doing something wrong by disrespecting that. It‚Äôs like insanely low self worth. It used to be easy to rationalise this; I didn‚Äôt get much romantic attention, so it didn‚Äôt matter what I felt. Now I do, and I‚Äôll be happily talking to someone, or getting to know them, and it turns sexual and suddenly I need to get out of it.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs asexuality, I want to have sex. I‚Äôm just scared. And any time something does happen I feel intense guilt. I‚Äôve made out with a few girls now, and every time I have intense guilt after. I replay it in my head the next day, wondering if it was all okay, if I went too far, if maybe they didn‚Äôt actually want to, even though like every time they initiated it or kissed me because I was too scared to kiss them. 

Last week I had a really explicit example; I was in a club and this girl literally just told me I‚Äôm cute, we talked for a few minutes, she told me she wanted to kiss me and we ended up making out for quite a while. She was clearly really into it; the kissing got really intense, we were both grabbing each other, she was basically grinding herself against me while we made out and like lifting her leg up over me to get as close as possible lmfao. We pulled away a couple of times and just kept going back in. After that she said ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love if we could fuck right now‚Äô, but then my friends told me they were leaving. They said they get it if I decided to stay, but I left with them. The next day I was terrified because what if she wanted me to stop? What if she was too drunk, or I‚Äôd taken advantage or something (I was really drunk too). Like I don‚Äôt think any of that‚Äôs the case rationally; it was a drunken makeout where we both just got a little carried away. It happens. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like dirty and like I done something wrong.

I don‚Äôt know where it comes from. It‚Äôs like intense guilt surrounding sex, like it‚Äôs something i shouldn‚Äôt be doing, or like women can‚Äôt like me enough to want that from me, so my brain decides I must be a creep for even wanting to or enjoying it. There‚Äôs been other times too where someone‚Äôs made a move on me and I just feel so creepy for reciprocating, and usually they‚Äôre incredibly blatant about wanting something to happen.

"I removed this girl from Instagram because she never replies back to my messages, now she's going out of her way to follow me back again. Why? Hi, everyone!  
I'm new to this community.   
  
I've recently made a new Instagram account because I deleted my old one back in 2018.  
So, I decided that I will keep my account just for family and close friends.  
As I was searching for people. I found this girl that I used to know in college.  
I actually had a little crush on her. She's single and everything. She posts a lot of selfies and stories of herself, showing off her beautiful body and going on hikes with her dogs.  
  
I've sent her a follow request on Instagram because her account is private, and so was mine.  
She accepted my request, and she followed me back.  
So, I've sent her a private message saying, ""Hi, Lily!"" with smiley emoji.  
She read my message and never replied back. I wasn't trippin about it or anything because she probably will get back to me soon, no big deal.  
  
But a week past, and I noticed she never replied back at all. But I've noticed she watched all of my stories and such. So, I started getting all of these weird thoughts in my head. I was thinking, maybe sending her a message saying ""Hi, Lily"" with a smiley emoji came off too strong, or I came off too ""thirsty"" or I sounded like a ""creep"".  
  
I just took the hint that she doesn't want to talk to me. So, I unfollowed her, and I clicked the ""remove friend"" so she doesn't follow me back. I know it sounds petty. But I just took it as she wanted nothing to do with me. And nowadays, women will easily label the guy as a creep for trying to slide into her DMs. Men told me, if a woman doesn't reply to you at all, she doesn't like you, and that you should just take the hint and move on. Because women will always make time to get back to a guy that she likes.  
A few days has passed. And I woke up in the morning to a notification. It was Lily. She's requesting to be my friend on Instagram again. I'm very confused now. Why would she go out of her way to send me a follow request if she doesn't want to talk to me at all? I don't keep people as friends on Instagram if they won't want to reply back.

"I‚Äôm feeling insecure about my sex life and relationship with my girlfriend I (28M) have been with my gf (30f) for about 3.5 years now. She is my first gf. In high school I never had the confidence to talk to girls and have relationships. I was always focused on school and extracurricular activities. Even in college, I didn‚Äôt have any relationships or hook ups either I did lose my virginity to my high school friend in college and she was also my first kiss. It wasn‚Äôt until after college I started working and got into online dating is when I finally start. I had a lot of Situationships with girls. And a lot of them even would be surprised when I told them I‚Äôve never had a relationship before they all said I was very good looking and very charming.

My girlfriend on the other hand, had a very different experience growing up. She had high school relationships, high school hook ups, college relationships, college hook ups.  She has definitely had a lot more hook ups than I have. She only has one more sexual partner than I have. She‚Äôs done the whole sneaking out at night to go see her boyfriend, looking up at the movies, trying different sexual experiences (car sex, shower sex, etc.) 

What makes me insecure is that I haven‚Äôt had a lot of these experiences growing up. My security isn‚Äôt so much that she has been with other people because I have also been with other people it‚Äôs more so that she had a lot of these experiences growing up since high school college whereas I only had like a few experiences later in life.

I don‚Äôt live in LA or NY but I live nearby in a more suburban area, yet the general consensus is the same, men in these more urban areas are less likely to settle down. While men in more rural areas have more of a family culture and settle down.

little about me I‚Äôve been solo traveling for a while now, been great so far in terms of socializing, meeting friends, girls, etc.

I‚Äôve had quite a few ons in this trip which is great because there‚Äôs no commitment and you‚Äôll never think about them anymore and it‚Äôs just about having fun.

Although I met this one girl from a different country than me on my last night in a city, my type, great smile(my weakness), likable social typa person. night was great but cut short because she drank a lot.. she wanted me to stay another night in the city and was sincerely happy when I said I extended for one more night.
her friend also let me know that the girl was into me so I was even more excited to try to make things happen.
We went out the night after, everything was great, we did it, cuddled and chatted about how nice the night was. 
After that I went to another city but ofc I wanted to see her again(she also said that I should come, that she misses me) because I assumed there‚Äôs a little bit of potential out of it.
when I changed my routes to see her, and even when I got to the city she was at, she was a little bit colder, sometimes took 16-22 hours to respond.
 one day she went out but she said I could come if I want to but I said nah that‚Äôs not an invitation. 
The day after she told me she wanted to see me that night and will never forgive herself if she doesn‚Äôt see me here.
the other day we did meet, had a picnic with wine, she complimented me all the time, we laughed, we had some open talks, went to a ferris wheel and listened to her earphones music together, made out, made stupid funny selfies and pictures, just like in the movies. we chatted about meeting the day after,
but the day after she disappeared for like the whole day and would not respond, then in the night she wanted to stay home and not go out. It was her last night, so I asked if I see her before she leaves, she said ye tomorrow midday before she takes the train. I said great let‚Äôs see each other an hour before and
she never responded again.

I was never played as great as this time, since I got all these compliments from her multiple times about my personality, my looking, my humor, my style, my smell, figured out she‚Äôs very into from her friend, and what? tryna avoid me in a way and not reach out to meet as much as I tried or even meet for a goodbye.

"Has there been a rise in Incels and femcels? A buddy of mine just showed me a text from a woman he rejected and it was fucking insane. She wrote a whole ass novel on how much of a piece of shit my friend was. They literally had 1 date and it was terrible. My friend said that she showed up late and smelled like weed. He stated in his profile that he didn't want to be with someone that smoked weed, so he thought it was rude for her to show up smelling like weed. The woman was texting him that he was going to die alone and that he was a LVM because he only made 70K a year and drove a 2021 Toyota. She also made fun of his height, even though he's literally 6 feet tall lmaoo. 

My sister showed me texts from a guy that found her dating profile. She has never even met the guy irl and the guy was already calling her names and trying to make her feel bad. Like the dude sent her 10 texts and was calling her names and telling her that she was a LVW

"how to feel confident in yourself after a breakup? okay so me (F23) and my ex (M) broke up about 3 months ago, i‚Äôve only dated him and one other person a year ago. it takes a really long time for me to feel comfortable enough to date someone and both of my relationships ended by them. my first ex ghosted me &amp; my most recent ex broke up with me 3 months ago. he told me he just wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and wasn‚Äôt over his last ex of 3 years and i was understanding about it. we both said we wanted to stay friends but my confidence after this is completely shot. 

why am i always the one to get broken up with? it must be something i‚Äôm doing if it‚Äôs happened multiple times but i feel like i‚Äôm a kind and understanding person. he told me i was his sweetest and kindest girlfriend and that he appreciated that i always listened to him and got along well with his friends. but it just feels like i‚Äôm doing something wrong, every time i get to the 2 month mark with someone, they end things with me. maybe i‚Äôm just not long term relationship material? :/ idk, i‚Äôve been trying to get over this for months, i just feel so unconfident in my personality and appearance. 

i‚Äôm working on losing weight right now but i feel like the main issue is my personality. i told him while we were together that i have a fear of being left and not feeling wanted, maybe it was a mistake to tell him that only a couple months into the relationship? i‚Äôm quite open about how i feel and what i think, not everyone likes that kind of quality. i unadded him on everything about a month ago to try to move on but i still constantly miss him and haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone new bc of how the breakup is effecting me. i just don‚Äôt know how to move on and feel good about myself again, any advice would be appreciated üòÖ",chubbylil,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eumjk/how_to_feel_confident_in_yourself_after_a_breakup/,1690843599.0,1.0

"How does any guy afford hookups in the modern dating scene?? Fired up tinder after a long term relationship went south, so decided to get out there and have some short term fun. I make it clear that i just got out of a relationship, which for some matches is fine. I know the vast majority of women my age (34M) are only looking to date to get married and have kids, and dating after 30 gets infinitely gets more difficult for men, however there are still some fringe cases where single guys somehow manage to get laid without any commitments. 

Seeing how im not filthy rich and lack a six pack, and after filtering out all the single mothers, the matches filtered in slowly. However taking these women out on dates is getting ridiculously pricey. 100-200$ dinner dates with drinks might not seem too expensive at first, but they add up over time. Expensive professional alternatives seem to be making more and more financial sense especially with the caliber of single women over 30, but I don‚Äôt want to go that route. I live in the suburbs so taking any potential date home is an hour long endeavor, which would involve expensive Ubers. 

Do all these hookup stories on Reddit involve people in their late teens or early 20‚Äôs that makes hookups seem so trivially easy? I set my age range from 20-40 but of course no woman under 30 will go out with a guy in their early to mid 30‚Äôs unless they have a financial incentive to do so. 

It‚Äôs been a few months and I‚Äôve wasted upwards of 2-3k$ and tens of hours of my time with absolutely nothing to show for it.

"What's the Psychology Behind Slow Texting? I don't understand slow texters at all. Either I want to talk to someone instantly, or I  don'tvwant to talk to them at all; so when I get a text, I immediately read it and respond, usually within a couple of minutes of it being sent--sometimes only seconds. I'll then carry through the conversation to a natural stopping point. Or, if it's a text I don't want to answer, I'll block that person.

This is my procedure with friends, partners, and even mere acquaintances. I do this even though I'm a fairly busy person with responsibilities, and I don't find it at all difficult to respond promptly to everyone. Texting an eloquent and fitting response is not hard if you have any readiness with language. It takes mere seconds.

Compare this with a young woman I've been seeing. She'll text asking me how my day is on Thursday. I'll respond within a minute or two, and she won't text back (or even read my message) till Sunday afternoon. This is something she does repeatedly. It's fine for her to not want to talk, but why text me at all if you aren't interested in my response? 

Can anyone explain the thinking behind this kind of texting behavior? I can't even begin to wrap my mind around it. ",Snoo-93317,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15evjij/whats_the_psychology_behind_slow_texting/,1690845910.0,1.0

Sometimes, I would unconsciously throw things to him instead of handing them to him (ex. if he wanted a roll of paper towels, I‚Äôd toss them and he‚Äôd shield himself‚Äîyes, I was stupidly inconsiderateü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I felt bad). Randomly hugging him from behind would startle him at times too. I would feel so bad when he would get startled, because I know he has PTSD from his previous relationship, even though I never would hurt him. 

Recently, after 6 months, I‚Äôve been noticing he never flinches anymore. It‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt necessarily point out to him, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed, and I‚Äôve been super happy about it! :) I‚Äôm still kind of learning how to get him to trust me physically (I‚Äôve never dated a guy who has been abused before), so if anyone has any advice, that would be appreciated. I would probably think that the best way to get him to trust me physically is by continuing to treat him gently, which I naturally do anyway!",notacheesygirl,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eaqz8/my_boyfriend_was_abused_by_his_exgirlfriend_for/,1690794093.0,0.89
"IDEK I (26F) have been seeing a man (24M) for a few months. I am the first serious person he‚Äôs pursued since a messy breakup with his ex of 4 years a few years ago. Since then he‚Äôs been with 2 other girls, nothing serious, had sex with them a few times then they went their separate ways then he met me. He assumed it‚Äôd be like that but I stuck around and he really likes me. He used to live local but moved away for work, about 12 hours away. We are both apprehensive about getting into a relationship since ours was messy and hurt. Before he left we were getting really close and I helped him pack and it was really emotional, he said saying goodbye to me was very hard for him. He is depressed where he lives now and I have see an obvious decline in his personality. I visited him this weekend and asked him if he was losing feelings. Convos seem mundane and I feel like a distraction. I asked him this and he responds; ‚ÄúI see my friends going through life and I‚Äôm here. I see people living their lives and I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt do anything, I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on life. You aren‚Äôt a distraction, well kind of, not in the bad way you think. You pull me out of this and keep me grounded. You bring me back home. You are the one thing that keeps me out of the bad headspace. I battle myself with you. You‚Äôre everything I wanted in a partner, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, it‚Äôs me. Idk if I‚Äôm ready for a girlfriend. I try to make my mind go there and it just doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm trying not to hurt your feelings bc I‚Äôve been in the receiving end of this conversation. I‚Äôm just afraid of wasting your time.‚Äù He‚Äôs always been apprehensive about pursuing me I think he‚Äôs scared we are going to date and breakup. He used to be super against cuddling, hand holding, etc., saying it made him anxious but now we do that and he‚Äôs fine. He told me that he stopped making the relationship between us super sexual, bc we used to sext a looooooot when he first got there, he said his last relationship was based on sex and wanted something deeper this time. He keeps saying if we date blah blah blah, like romanticizing the idea, like after we had that talk. I‚Äôm so confused. Idk if he‚Äôs saying he just likes me as a friend, not romantically, or if he needs things to move slower, he told me I move fast which I do. I just don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm crazy about him, we hold hands in public, try to make the most out of seeing each other, good morning/ good night texts, he updates me on everything going on in his life, text 24/7. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I was never looking for a boyfriend I wanted to focus on myself but found him. I think it‚Äôs a lot of fear, he seems very scared from his ex.

"Women are spoilt with choices with men and this is eating me up 
Women have so many choices on dating apps at least and men usually have to obey the lady. New to dating and this is eating me day by day up as it's so difficult to find someone. Many men want sex so women can keep blocking them and calling everyone a creep 
However, is the game same for a long term relationship? Women still have the authority even if a guy wants a relationship? Is this the same when it comes to physical interaction (not dating apps)?

How do you find people who are understanding? I (26m) have recently identified with the help of my therapist that the kind of person I would be looking to date is probably going to need to be someone who is understanding/compassionate. The reason for this is I‚Äôm a often a misunderstood person who is passed off because of my parents success or because of other reasons. What I‚Äôm trying to understand is what are some qualities or some indicators that someone is understanding or compassionate when it comes to dating. One of the ideas I had is that maybe someone‚Äôs job can suggest that they might be a more understanding person but it‚Äôs also entirely possible that is not true as well. I‚Äôm leaning towards thinking that some teachers might be more understanding types. If this is the case what sort of jobs and or hobbies would someone who is understanding do? Also what are some of the qualities that might stand out in someone who is understanding?

"I've been ghosted by the first girl that i have actually loved I recently got ghosted by someone I thought was important to me. We had a fight while she was in Mexico on an internship (just during the summer break, she'll be back in a week), so everything was through text. We go to the same university, and the summer break is almost over, so she'll be back soon. I'm afraid to meet her by coincidence at university because she hasn't responded to my messages, even though I've tried to talk to her and resolve things. I opened up to her about a lot of things, and it was the first time I felt in love with someone.  
  
She was the first girl I ever introduced to my family, and I had never felt this way for someone before. I was aware that I was giving more than I was receiving, but she was open with me too. She told me things that she doesn't share with other people, like her traumas and family problems. I can't help but care about her.  
  
Before she went to Mexico, she talked to me about how she felt like she couldn't be a good partner for anyone. Of course, I was honest and told her that I was willing to make things work with her, and that we would figure it out. She made me happier than I already was.  
  
But at that moment, something changed. I felt like she was looking for an excuse to be distant or to just walk away. She was inconsistent with her behaviour, sometimes praising me and other times finding something wrong with everything I did.  
  
She went to Mexico, and she was really busy and barely even texted, let alone talked. I told her that I thought it would be best for both of us to focus on ourselves while we were apart, and she got mad and told me that I was confusing her and she was tired of the same old thing. (I felt like this was just an excuse.)  
  
She hasn't responded to my texts, but she hasn't blocked me on social media either. She watches my stories, and she even liked a picture I posted on my stories a while ago.  
  
Since that day, she hasn't talked to me. The summer break is almost over, and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid and anxious. The last time I saw her in person, we had an amazing date. Now look at us.

"Girl I was messaging stopped replying Long and short of it: I (22m) matched with a girl (22f) on tinder. She liked me first, and her interests, location and listed personality traits all matched mine. I sent the first message, asked an open ended question about one of her hobbies/pictures, and she responded in kind. We sent 3 or so more messages, and every time I sent one she liked it (the little heart react tinder has).

But then after that (two to three days, 1-2 texts a day) she stopped responding. I chalked it up to her job taking her away for a bit (her listed job was one that involved travel) but it's been 25 days since then and she's not even read any of my texts. I can't tell if I'm being ghosted, and if so why. I felt like we were hitting it off great, and one of my feminine friends saw my texts, she agreed that none of what I sent sounded weird or upsetting. She didn't unmatch me either, since the chat is still active.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm asking for here, this is half venting half wondering what I did/ should do. I sent one message about a week and a half after she stopped responding saying ""I'm not sure why you stopped responding, but assuming you just got busy hit me up again whenever you feel like it, I'd love to talk and get to know you more no matter how long it's been"" and left it at that.

"Taking a break from talking to a guy I really like &amp; really likes me while I figure out what I want I (24F) went on a first date with a guy who's just shy of 10 years older than me 1 week before leaving the city I live in and I told him about me leaving the city we live in for a few months to get some health treatments. 

We had made plans to see each other the day before my flight, but he sent me a text message the afternoon before our plans saying that he really liked me and is attracted to me, but was not ready for something serious, especially at long distance. He said that he still wanted to keep in touch and get to know me. At the time, I was like ""I don't even have the bandwidth for a serious relationship"" and we talked things out and decided to continue chatting.

We have stayed in decent communication (mainly via text &amp; voice notes, plus 2 phone calls) while he was on vacation and I have been recovering from surgery. I've been talking to him for about 2 months. 

Last week, we had some conversations that felt emotionally really intimate and I freaked out and felt like all of a sudden I actually DO want a serious relationship. (The thing is I do--but still so far down the line that I can't even see that happening in the next 6 months for me, I just didn't know it at the time when I was trying to tell him this). 

I sent him a message saying that my feelings had changed and that it turns out I actually did want something serious. Long story short, we decided to part ways amicably because I was not interested in being friends with him. 

However, I've been reflecting on my decision for the past few days, and I think that it's a good idea I stopped talking to him, but mainly because things were moving too quickly for me over text and I was afraid of falling for the idea of this person I was creating in my head (because of the distance, and also because i have more time on my hands to let my imagination run wild), so I cut it out. I find that I really miss him and I still want to see him when I move back to our city in about a month, and I am trying my hardest not to text him again and be like ""lol sike!"" 

I've realized that I actually don't know what dating is and what getting to know someone looks like, because my only serious long term relationship started after a 4 year friendship with a guy, so we became officially pretty quickly. I'm also realizing that I may be more impatient than I ever knew, because when I look at the situation as if one of my friends was telling me about it, I would be like you need to chill tf out you still don't know this guy. I'm hoping that I haven't ruined my chances of getting to know him by getting in my own way afls;djfaskld. 

I have 2 questions: 

1) in this interim time out I've put myself in, how can I really hone in on determining what I want? I find that the extra time I have on my hands is clouding my judgement making, and because I'm essentially in solitary confinement, I am feeling lonelier than usual. I will be resuming physical activity soon and slowly getting my life back together, so I'm hoping that helps. 

2) How should I approach seeing him again when I'm ready? Should I say I've been thinking about him or just ask him for a casual coffee and see how it goes from there?

last night i asked how she felt things were going between us and she mentioned she doesnt want to get into a relationship until the divorce is finalized which is beginning of september. she also mentioned that i'm not allowed to go inside their apartment out of respect for her ex wife.
i guess im just having mixed feelings bc im worried she may be hiding me from her but she insists she isnt. what's also been bothering me is that they separated in April.. only almost 4 months ago and they were together for 4 years. she said she's worked through it and now she wants a partner. should i just get over my own insecurities and trust her? or should i cut it off while its still relatively fresh?

"Is It Creepy To Ask A Girl To Reject Me? Reposting from another subreddit. 

*For context: I'm not good with women I find attractive. Most of the time I assume they're creeped out by me. I also don't know where to stop with girls so I just never start to begin with. It sucks.*

*Also, I exaggerate for humor. It may seem like I'm extremely attached to this girl and utterly heartbroken, but this is not true. I am only utterly heartbroken.*

I (24, M) met a girl (no idea, F) via an out-of-state program.  We didn't talk much, mostly because I'm terrible with women I find attractive, but I got a sense that she liked me back. I won't go into the post-mortem here. It was a new feeling for me. I immediately assumed I must be hallucinating the signs of attraction. I kept going back and forth until the very end, mostly because the signs kept getting more pronounced, but nothing significant came out of it. We talked twice one-on-one and several times in group settings.

**For those of you in a similar situation right now:** I'm still kicking myself for not talking to her during the myriad other chances I had. Go talk to whoever it is you like. Ask them out. Don't be like me.

Anyways, I realized at the very end of the program that she wasn't utterly creeped out by me, so I messaged her on an app (whose name I will redact for fear of ridicule) (it's popular and used for work-related stuff). She seemed to be okay with me. The conversation quickly died off, so I left things and assumed I'd been rejected. That was fine by me. I stuffed myself with tamales and moped in private.

Four days later, I was informed that it was *my* fault.

Apparently, I text like a sentient slice of white bread. It's incredibly difficult to continue conversations because my messages feel AI generated. This was a revelation to me, because I'd assumed that she didn't want to talk to me at all. Turns out that wasn't necessarily true. There's a chance I'd misinterpreted the whole thing again.

So I did what any logical person would do. I prepped a message asking for her number, edited it thrice, asked a beta reader to proof-read it, edited it again, scrapped it, wrote something else, downed a few beers, and sent the new message to her at around midnight.

Checked my DMs the next morning. No response. Rejection. Cue sad songs and staring out of car windows longingly.

To reiterate, I'm not obsessed, just melodramatic. It didn't help that I thought she liked me back. I won't lie: I mulled over a lot of our interactions to see if I'd misinterpreted her behavior. It just didn't make sense to me. Still doesn't. Anyways, cut to a few days later, and I delete the app because it has no use for me anymore.

Which is when something occurred to me. *What if she'd done the same thing?*

It is unlikely, but entirely feasible, that she also deleted it because she had no use for it. Our conversation ended three days prior and I hadn't seen her online since then. The first time I texted her, I had confirmation that she was still on it. It was a 'now or never' moment for me. I wasn't stuck to the app all day to find out but she seemed to be on it frequently.

Not this time. As far as I can tell, I hadn't seen her online in days, before or after my message.

(Again -- I would like to emphasize this -- I haven't been checking every hour. I have a life outside pining for this girl. That also means I don't know for sure if my theory is correct.)

There's also no 'seen' notifications on this app.

Now the uncertainty is killing me. Did she ghost me? Did she even see my eloquent little 'u up'? I don't know. I feel like the safest way to find out would be to text her, something to the effect of 'hey, did you even see this? \[app\] doesn't tell me and I'M DYING TO KNOW', but I think that might be too creepy to do. The lack of an answer is tearing me apart. I'd be ~~relatively~~ okay with a rejection at this point, as long as I knew that's exactly what it was.

I'm lost. I don't want to be the guy that double texts after being ghosted and creeps people out. I'll be more of a laughing stock than I already am. On the other hand, I don't want her to see my message a year after everything went down. I want her to know I like her now, and I want to know her answer now. I don't mind on this 1-in-100 edge case.

So, once again, I need your help. Nothing makes sense. I'm driving myself crazy. Someone please tell me what I should (or should not) be doing in this situation. This is my first time expressing interest in a girl too, at least explicitly, so I'm not equipped to deal with this at all.

"Why do ppl do this/How can I handle this gracefully? Why are some ppl like this? Also how tf do I handle things gracefully.

I attended a martial arts training camp about a month ago. It was a big one with ppl flying in from across the country and international too. Met lots of ppl there including one girl from BC who seemed very friendly. She first asked for my number just to help give rides to her friends who needed transportation to and from the venue. But then started texting random questions (shit you can easily google), added me on my socials, randomly messaged me on them.

She knows I'm in a relationship already with someone else (it's literally on my fb page and my profile pic is if me and my gf). I made no secret of my gf when she added me on my socials. Said to her face ""that's my gf."" But she keeps messaging me on my socials. Shit like ""hey u up?"" Or liking and commenting on my insta stories. I just leave her on read or respond with one or two word answers only if I do reply at all. Could be she's just friendly - I hope that's what it is - but it just feels weird. I don't wanna be rude but also don't want her comin' at me since I love my gf and want to keep the relationship safe. How can I shut her down in a kind way?

Also, if she is trying to flirt, I just wanna know: What are people like this thinking? Do they really think they can successfully steal you? And if they do, do they really think you'll be loyal to them?

"Is it unethical to hook up with a different girl after a single date? My friend's sister came to my house to help clean my room. After, we got ice cream and I paid. She was really generous to offer to clean my room. I think she might have romantic feelings for me. I also do for her. The only issue is that she is my friend's sister, and I don't want to harm our friendship if something were to happen. I probably won't continue anything romantic with her because of this. 


I also have a FWB that hit me up asking to hook up tonight. I might feel a little guilty because my friend's sister was really generous to me and she might like me. She helped me a lot and then I could just be disrespecting it by hooking up with someone else right? Would it be unethical to hook up with my FWB?

"Boyfriend wants me to stop stripping When I met my boyfriend he knew that I was working at a stripclub making very good money about two months into us dating . Now the economy has slowed down and I am not making as much but I‚Äôm sure it will eventually pick up again. I am 34 years old and still making more money than the average person in America . My plan was to quit when I could no longer make money stripping and once I found a stable alternative career. I am starting a small business and it‚Äôs in its infancy so it‚Äôs not 100 percent reliable to fall back on. I have never had an issue finding long term relationships and women working in my job are often married with families. Their husbands understand it‚Äôs just a job and men can look at  them but they can‚Äôt touch them. It is like being an actress . Their husbands don‚Äôt like it but I guess they tolerate it as there is a lot of pros ( the women make good money and able to have savings when most people these days can‚Äôt afford even an emergency fund, they only have to work a few days a week, and can retire early if they make proper investments). 

However now my boyfriend is telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want to get married unless I stop stripping. He has not proposed to me. I think it‚Äôs fair that I tell him that unless I have a proposal I am not going to give up my source of income especially since the guy I‚Äôm dating is not making enough to provide solely on his income alone. He has a good pension but his income is not great. I have bills to pay and have some health issues with medical expenses . I think this is a fair compromise . Either that or I tell him that I‚Äôm going to continue stripping and he can leave the relationship if he wants to, as I was doing this when we met and I actually find it offensive that he thinks he can ask me to change my job now at this time. He says that my job is not good for my mental health . And I totally agree, a lot of the men have to be asked to leave for saying inappropriate things or trying to touch the dancers. However, there are a lot of jobs where people don‚Äôt feel great about what they do for a living and they keep going because they have bills to pay . I am also preparing to make an exit but not until I am financially secure with another job or business . Is what I am asking a fair compromise , or should I just move on ?

"fwb suddenly seems distant and jealous??? 
very long but i (24F) have a really close friend (23M) and i think I might be ruining our friendship? we met years ago (2017) and started off in a bit of a talking stage and definitely had major chemistry/liked each other but lived in different places so nothing came of it. We just kinda evolved into friends and talked pretty much every day for a couple of years, but his ex started coming back in the picture and didn‚Äôt want him to talk to me anymore so we didn‚Äôt speak for about a year or so. 

A couple of years ago we ran into each other and started talking every day again like nothing happened. We‚Äôre almost never in the same place and we‚Äôve always been flirtatious but in mostly a joking way and one thing we‚Äôve always done is talk super openly about other people we were seeing/hooking up with etc. and gave each other advice.

Fast forward to the last month or so and we were finally in the same area and hung out a couple of times one weekend with other friends and (according to everyone around us) were completely inseparable the whole time we were all out. It was kinda surprising that we were only paying attention to each other bc one thing we‚Äôve always joked about is how we get in trouble in relationships bc we flirt with people too much and ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with different people every time we go out. Apparently everyone we were around actually assumed we were dating bc of our body language, and when a I told a few people that we were just friends they were shocked and I thought it was funny and joked about it with him a lot.

We ended up hooking up for the first time since 2017 that weekend and everything still seemed normal, but the next weekend we ended up going on an overnight trip alone to see a concert together and hooked up again a couple of times. It definitely got kinda romantic at points and I had an incredible time but during a lot of the trip I felt a kinda weird tension between us almost like he didn‚Äôt know if he was allowed to be ‚Äúromantic‚Äù with me or touch me etc. I actually brought it up while I was drunk that night and he said he was nervous about making me uncomfortable and then I straight up asked what he felt was going on between us. We both agreed that we obviously have a very serious emotional connection and a mutual attraction but neither of us are interested in a relationship (he‚Äôs emotionally recovering from a breakup and I honestly just enjoy being single). We also don‚Äôt live in the same state so *i* left that convo feeling like everything was normal and that nothing between us had changed.

Fast forward to the last couple of weeks and I think that ‚Ä¶something between us changed. I still talk with him like I always did about other guys n our antics and he‚Äôs seemed kinda shady about it recently? Like joking about being jealous and he‚Äôs never done that before, but I know that he‚Äôs told me over the years that he can be jealous and insecure about girls he likes. It‚Äôs a little annoying bc even though I obviously have feelings for him to an extent, exploring anything other than friendship when we‚Äôre not together is pointless. I also know (or maybe assume) he‚Äôs planning on hooking up with other girls in the future and is super active on dating apps and I genuinely don‚Äôt care. The only boundary I set was that if we‚Äôre together physically we shouldn‚Äôt hook up with other people around each other and he agreed. I also at one point asked if it was weird for him when I talked about other guys (bc I can totally respect that) but he just ignored that and started talking about something else.

I‚Äôve always been incredibly oblivious when it comes to recognizing when guys actually like me and have actually lost a couple of friends over the years after making out with/hooking up w them bc I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal and they ended up being hurt. He‚Äôs one of my favorite people to talk to and spend time with so I really don‚Äôt want to ruin it, but I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overthinking things or if he actually has more feelings for me than I thought.

TL;DR‚Äîa good friend and I hooked up a few times and acknowledge that we‚Äôre attracted to each other but there‚Äôs no possibility of a relationship between us. I thought our friendship would stay the same, but now I‚Äôm worried that I might have misread his feelings and now I think he might actually like me more than I thought and want to know if I might just be overthinking the situation",Intelligent_Hunter37,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15etlvm/fwb_suddenly_seems_distant_and_jealous/,1690841118.0,1.0
"(30M) I've never been in a relationship, which also means I've never had a GF, and I've never been on a proper date. Has the ship sailed for me? I apologize in advance if this goes haywire, I don't know how to write what I want to write in proper fashion or if it's going to come out right. Having said that, here I go... So yeah, the title is the gist of what my love life is like. I blame no one but myself. I would say from the time of middle school up until the time the pandemic really started, no dates/kisses/relationships/sex, also it didn't help that (among other things) my teeth did not look good. And for the most part I was overweight. Before I started working for the first time at age 23, I was a nobody, just at home taking up space and not doing a whole lot of living. So how would I get my fix if you will if I couldn't have a gf or have sex? Porn. I know, smh. Heck, I would say I still struggle with porn and masturbation to this day. There was an improvement in my life around the time the pandemic started, I finished my Invisalign treatment after 1 1/2 years. But I found it ironic that I was ready to show off my new smile and then the mask mandate happened haha. But yeah, getting my teeth fixed was the most important thing that could have happened to me, it needed to happen. From there I think things improved slightly, at least I became a little bit more social, mainly with people from work. And then, the best thing that happened to me last year, I met my best friend (I'll call her Jennifer (not real name of course) at work. We got to know each other little by little, and to this day we are best friends. At some point, there were times (not many) where we were more than just friends, we kissed, cuddled, and of course had sex. Even with us doing that, we are, and will remain, best friends. The reason I bring that up is if it wasn't for her giving me those experiences than I would be here at 30 years old thinking to myself when is this this this and this going to happen. I could never repay her for what she did for me, she didn't have to do that, but she wanted to give me for the first time in my life a taste of what I want in my love life, when it comes to the physical stuff, the dating/relationship stuff is a whole other thing.

"When and how it is acceptable to ask about your partner's previous relationships and sexual history? Probably a controversial topic, let me explain.  
  
I \[27M\] have a religius background, but I have not been religious at all since I was about 16, I would define myself as an atheist at the moment. Although I am no longer religious, my upbringing had a strong influence on my values. I have been only in 3 long time relationships and only had sex with these three girl. I did not participate in hookup culture at all, 0 one night stand, 0 fwb. Sex is something that for me involves a lot of emotions and I need to feel connecion and trust.  
  
As I hold and have lived by these views, I would look for the same in my future partner, but I don't know how and when to ask. Many people get offended if I ask anything about their past at the beginning, but I think it's something that should be discussed early enough so we don't waste each other time and don't hurt eachother.  
  
This is not about numbers. If she had 10 1 year long realationship and had sex with all 10 is perfectly fine for me, but if she had 2 one night stands or fwb it's a turn off for me.  
  
I honestly don't want to judge anyone. It's perfectly fine if someone has different views on this. I know many people will probably disagree with me, but these are my preferences, and I need advice on when and how to bring this up without offending others and to find out if we share the same views.

"IMO being emotionally mature and open is actually a detriment to dating now I'm someone who is now (wasn't always for sure) very comfortable with themselves and I do not mind being open and honest with people. 

I understand the whole oversharing and being too intense at first meet can be a huge problem, but this is not what i'm talking about. 

I mean like weeks into dating, being open about what your expectations are with someone, sharing that you really care about them and being open about your feelings. Again, this is like 5th-10th date i'm talking about.

90% of the time I get completely ghosted after. 

It's really my opinion that if you are emotionally mature and open and honest, you are in the minority of people these days in the dating scene, and doing such makes people who are not extremely uncomfortable, lesser than you, and brings up emotions they don't want to deal with. 

I am probably chasing after the wrong type of person, but its really been my experience lately with most of my attempts at dating.

"We are both [M32] [F32] and entered a relationship recently. She is hesitant to add me as a friend on Instagram. Am I looking too deep into this? 




We've been together for close to four months now. Could this be considered a red flag?

 She says she rarely uses her account yet her post count has been decreasing weekly as if she's deleting photos, which I find odd considering how she claims to rarely ""access her account.""

I realize it's just a silly social media app but the underlying issue for me is if she is trying to hide something from me. I'm someone who values trust and transparency in a relationship.

How can I bring this up with her without it being weird?

"I messed up, I saved my crush's other number secretly and now he's found out, I don't know what to do. Okay so, please don't judge but I've messed up a little bit and I know I sound like a red flag.  
I've been talking to this guy for the last 2 months, we hit it off, we exchanged numbers and we started talking and calling on whatsapp. That's cool. It's normal. So now I started developing a crush on this guy and you know when that happens you start searching them up. So I did just that. His socials are public so I could see every post, every like. Everything. I did a happy dance because now I could get to know him a bit better. We don't have each other on socials, we just have each others numbers so this was exciting.  
Anyway, so now as I'm scrolling through facebook, I see that he's made a post on a group we both had in common a few months ago and he posted his phone number there, a different one. So I did the thing that only intellectuals would do. I saved that number in my phone. I don't know what I was thinking. I just did it thinking if he ever pulled a prank on me from his other number now I'd know. That number was also active on whatsapp.  
Fast forward to today, I posted a status on my stories on whatsapp not knowing what the future held for me..A few hours later, a text comes through, I check my phone absolutely puzzled, turns out its from his number that I saved secretly. It said 'Why is your status showing up on this number of mine?' I saw his message and now I'm numb.   
I'm so scared. I know I did the wrong thing. Even though his post on facebook was public and anyone could contact him from there I still feel like it was an invasion of someones privacy as it was a bit of a personal post that he had made and I broke those rules. Now I'm too scared to admit what I actually did.  
Is there something else I can come up with that would seem legible? I don't want him to know I was stalking him as we hadn't talked since 5 days. He hadn't replied back to my text which is fine but now he's going to think it was all connected! I'm so worried. I don't know what to do. I just checked facebook and he deleted the post where I got his number from so I think he has an idea now. I'm so scared.

"My boyfriend is depressed and I don't know how to help/what to do I (23) started seeing my boyfriend (26) 4 months ago. Things were going great  but I noticed he occasionally has a few days of depressive episodes. I've struggled with mental health in the past and it seems like he would get out of the funk after a while. He came from the UK not long ago and is just settling in, but is currently struggling financially after the big move.
Recently, he's been getting really bad, to the point where I was concerned he was going to harm himself. I know he's had mental health issues in the past and has gone to therapy, which seemed to help, but this move has been super hard on him. 
I want to be there for him because I do love him but I don't know what to do anymore. He's agreed to go to therapy if we can find something free, but I'm concerned this will be a recurring thing and I don't know if I could do this my whole life. I know I'm young, and that I have time to figure out my life/relationships but I truly do care for him and want him to be better. I'm also quite concerned that if I do leave (which I hope I don't have to do) he will just spiral even more.

"Why are so many men embracing toxic dating advice? There was a dating advice website dedicated to men, and one of it's articles had the following advice:

""*When looking for a life partner, my advice to men is date all of them: the bad girls, the cool girls, the commitment-phobic girls, the crazy girls. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad girls sexy do not make them good wives. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks men should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do her share in the home. These women exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier.*""

"Different approaches by men and women on dating sites? (Not generalizing) New to this group so trying to keep the rules in mind.

As a prefix here, I want to be clear I am NOT generalizing, just relating my honest observations. 

I have used eharmony on and off since July 2021. I went to this site as it struck me in being one of the more reputable and 'serious' sites. I am a straight 37 year old man. 

My experience has been very mixed. I had some painful encounters but also met sincere matches, some of whom I mutually agreed to remain friends as we respected one another. This post will not be about all those experiences or all the ins and outs of online dating.

I want to be a bit more specific in one 'trend' I have noticed. 

I think it is fair to say that with online dating, much like physical dating, the man is expected to make the first move. I can honestly say about 95% of the conversations I have had with matches had been initiated by me and speaking to other men, they concur they initiated contact.

Inevitably, this means that male members need to have a certain level of persistence and effort, otherwise they are likely to have no communication at all. I am not talking about persistence with individuals (actually eharmony has a 5 post limit - ie send her a message, smiley face, like her intro etc) but rather the approach that is required to get any attention at all.

To give an idea of this persistence, I might message say, 8 matches I am interested in over a few weeks. Of those 8, I MIGHT get one response. I think only by communicating can you know if you are compatible with someone. 

Even when I do get a response, there is no guarantee of a follow up and I find some members find it easier to lie than be upfront and say they are not interested. 

Now before people get the wrong idea here, I am always polite, never sleazy and sincere in my desire to find the right match. I am average looking but I feel I 'sell' myself on my profile and I am open enough to show there are no obvious red flags. 

I know the problem isn't with my approach because of those matches I have spoke to the communication has largely been respectful and positive. In some cases she ultimately rejected me or I rejected her because we decided we were not compatible enough or there were external factors (different life plans, feelings for an ex etc) My point is I am not writing as some sort of insecure guy who lacks confidence or skill with women. 

I have had good relationships before and plenty of female friends. 

So why is the ratio of messages received/responses given the way it is? 

I used to think some members were basically rude - and to some extent I still believe that is the case. To me, if someone spent time composing a thoughtful message I would show them the basic respect of replying even if I wasn't really attracted to them. I literally came across one match who was asking guys to show they were sincere by writing a long message - then she couldn't be bothered to respond. 

When I have asked women about this, the responses are usually as follows: 

\- they had got hurt and felt foolish by making the first move and then getting rejected. 

\- Due to experience of sexual harassment they mistrusted the intentions of guys on dating sites. 

So let's consider these two points -

\- No one likes to be rejected but men get hurt too yet still have no choice but to continue making the first move

\- To be fair, this probably is something female members experience much more and I can understand if a woman is getting constant sleazy messages, she would become cynical and feel that is all male members are interested in. But this also in my view depends on the specific site. Some simply have a better quality of members than others. And of course there are plenty of men who are sincere in their search and not just looking for sex. 

I have also considered practical factors. Ultimately dating sites are businesses and in order to make a profit they rely on paid memberships. It may well be that a lot of members sign up to these sites then realize they cannot respond to messages. Or in some cases it really is an issue of time commitment - some people go in half-heartedly and/or simply get to busy to follow up. I think this is understandable - however I still think there should be a basic sense of consideration for others and that is something that people don't take accountability for. I am not talking about rejection. Any female or male member has a right to reject someone if they are not interested but there is no excuse to mislead someone or waste their time. 

Anyway, i'll round this up.

Some people may falsely interpret this as a rant about women on dating sites. It really isn't. I am well aware that people are individuals and for every entitled person who doesn't consider others there is another considerate person who does.

I think men and women both face pressures but in different ways. Broadly speaking (again I am not generalizing or saying one size fits all) Men do have to make more effort in that initial contact and experience message after message being ignored or not followed up. 

But women may well experience issues that we men cannot see. Maybe the aforementioned sleaziness is higher than one might think. After all, I can't see directly how other guys are communicating. Maybe pressure to 'not hurt his feelings' by telling him the truth. Personally I would rather have a polite rejection than ignored and I have experienced both. For me a polite rejection just means it is not meant to be with that person whereas being ignored really saps energy and makes you wonder - what is the point of trying? 

I have posted this in the spirit of being candid about my own experience and for something to think about. It is in no way intended to incite a 'battle of the sexes' but rather, hopefully help people to be more considerate in their approach to online dating. Maybe you are a woman and thinking 'but guys do that to!' and I would not argue. Online dating is damn difficult and takes enormous patience but I think people who are sincere and serious can all help to create a better experience.

Do members agree with my take? Maybe you have experienced something different? Maybe women here can follow up on some of the points i've raised for instance. But I do feel that whilst online dating can be trying for anyone, there are basic approaches that differ. In no way do I claim to speak for all men and I am absolutely aware people are individuals, I just think that men and women do think in different ways about some of this. 

Finally, I would appreciate no snarky responses ie 'this guy is just bitter etc' - my intention here is for mature discussion in the spirit I have written this. 

Actually at the time of writing, I am getting particularly close to one lady and whilst practical circumstances may keep us apart (she has a pre-planned work contract abroad and we are still awaiting the outcome of her exam) - so I am writing more in retrospect and to be informative and thought-provoking.

"Cultural Differences in Dating: Need Advice from U.S. Locals Hi everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl from Europe who recently came to the U.S. as an au pair. It's been a really exciting journey so far, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how boys here interact compared to back home.  
In my home country, it seems like boys are quite direct and straightforward when they're interested in someone. However, here in the U.S., I've noticed that their approach can be quite different, sometimes more nuanced or indirect.  
I find it somewhat challenging to interpret their actions and intentions. Are they just being friendly or are they interested in something more? I don't want to misinterpret any signals or make any assumptions that could lead to awkward situations.  
I guess what I'm asking is: could anyone give me some insights or advice on how to navigate these cultural differences? What signs should I look out for that might indicate a boy is interested in more than just friendship? I'd really appreciate any input, especially from those who have grown up here and understand the dating culture better.

"How do I become a real person? So I realized after looking at all these profiles over years and years, and reading all these posts about what to do, what not to do. My issue is that I‚Äôm not a real person. My profile just has selfies and pictures of my cats. Real people actually take pictures when they are out with their friends or accomplish something big or go somewhere cool. 

For that matter, real people go out with their friends, accomplish big things and go cool places. I don‚Äôt really do any of those things. I don‚Äôt enjoy my life. 

In fact, I kind of hate myself. I showed as much when 10 years ago as a teen I sliced up my arm. Of course I‚Äôm better now. I‚Äôve spent so much money on therapy and doing all the right things. I have hobbies; I have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù; I work myself to death in the gym; I take my meds; I am finishing a graduate degree. And yet, nothing I do can ever remove that massive red flag from my body. It can never make me a real person again. And you can‚Äôt be in a relationship with someone who is not real, at least not for very long or if they aren‚Äôt obscenely good looking. I mean I‚Äôm not ugly, but not good looking enough to make up for the red flags.

"28 [M] getting mixed signals from 24 [F] So I met this girl at the bar and we hit it off pretty well, extremely good chemistry and our humor similar. We agree to take things slow, we hug, cuddle, give eachother massages and light touching for about two months. Last week she calls me and says that she asks what I'm into sexually, she tells me she enjoys being a brat and thrown around etc.

I told her I enjoy being more dominating in bed and she says that im just saying that to get her aroused. Well she comes over and we're hanging out and she asks how to turn on my shower, so I take that as my queue and before I know it we're making out and touching eachother. This leads to us having rough sex and I finished in her hair which she was not okay with.

Afterwards we had dinner and I paid, we walked around for a bit and she decides to stay over at a friend's because she said she wants to hang out with her pet. I told her that's fine and decided to walk her there since it's about a mile away in a rough part of town.

She called me the next day and said that what happened last night was not okay and I came on way too strong, I told her I'm sorry but that's what she said she was into. She admitted she did talk a big talk but I was being selfish but she didn't like being degraded and vulnerable like that. She felt she needed to say this instead of things becoming awkward, but that situation can never happen again.

"I want to date again but I still feel hurt from my ex. So I dumped my ex like a year and three months ago. We've been together for 7 years and dated for 2.

Eventually I left her for being too disrespectful and insulting towards me. Essentially she was using me to vent and always had anger attacks that needed therapy.

Of course, she met and bragged about her new guy 2 weeks after the fact. And looking back on it. She reached out to me after an abusive ex dumper a couple of weeks prior. So I was a rebound that became long term and worked for the most part.

It's been a long time since all that mess. I waited with hopes for her to return for eleven months and just stopped waiting for her like a month ago.

Nevertheless, I know I'm not ready to date again just yet. 

The pain I feel is more so the realization of what type of person she really is. And I feel... Dissapointed by who she turned out to be and by how much I loved her.

I did have a rebound like 2 months after we broke up but It was only for like a week and that girl is now my best friend.

I am of the belief that love is not looked for. It's found. Love comes to you. So I won't go on dating apps or anything. Neither would I try to utilize a new relationship to replace my pain. (Like my ex did.) I just don't know if It's ok to date if my wounds are of dissapointment. I know I will continue to lament the bad ending of this chapter until I start the new chapter. But am I ok?

It‚Äôs a 40 minute wait.‚Äù I said ‚Äúoh ok should we go walk?‚Äù (We were in a market place setting) Meanwhile he‚Äôs sulking and obviously annoyed he gets up ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù then I suggest we sit at an empty table so we could comfortably talk and he got even more irritated. We sit down, he tells me ‚Äúthis is annoying why would you pick this place knowing I don‚Äôt like crowds I feel like you did this maliciously and on purpose to take shots at me‚Äù he told me in a previous conversation that he doesn‚Äôt like crowds but in no way did I think to this extent‚Ä¶ I was in shock! I again tried to reassure him that I would never do such a thing, even asking him if he wanted to go somewhere else. He declined ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point I already put my name down‚Äù 

He gets the ‚Äútable is ready‚Äù text so we get seated and while we‚Äôre looking at the menu I mention I might just get something small BUT HE EVEN GOT ANNOYED AT THAT. ‚ÄúWhy would you pick this place knowing you were just going to get an appetizer. It‚Äôs awkward that I‚Äôm going to be eating and you‚Äôre not.‚Äù Uhhh??? at this point getting up and walking out was running through my head. He ordered hot sake shots, took the first one without me lol. Told me to taste his cocktail so I took 2 sips and he said ‚Äúmight as well keep it, since you‚Äôre drinking it all.‚Äù 

Fast forward to the end of the night‚Ä¶. He pays the bill and we walk outside. He offers to walk me to my car &amp; asks me ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd you park at?‚Äù  I tell him I parked behind the theater. He replies ‚Äúlike I know where the hell that‚Äôs at‚Äù 
Not even half way there I stop him and we exchange a few words gave him a side hug and dipped. When I got home I texted ‚Äúthanks for dinner‚Äù he instantly responded ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome. I‚Äôm sorry for taking your time.‚Äù GUYS WTF   I‚Äôve never been treated this way and was in absolute disbelief.

"Advice on recent dating situation - uncertain about interest Hi everyone, I could use some advice on a dating situation that has me feeling a bit confused. I've been seeing this guy for almost a month now, and things seemed to be going well. We've been texting every day and meeting up every weekend. 

Last weekend, we had a fun double date with some friends, and everything seemed great. However, on Sunday, things got a bit weird.

He seemed a bit distant when I arrived on Saturday, but he blamed it on being tired from a late night out. The double date went well, or so I thought, but on Sunday, he suddenly had to meet a friend for a last-minute thing. He mentioned he thought he told me about it the night before, but I don't recall that conversation. After spending the night together, he texted me later in the day, and our texts have become quite cold. 

I'm torn between ignoring his last message to save face as he has suddenly gone cold and risk looking too keen if I bring up my concerns. I feel like he should know why I'm a bit bothered and notice my change in texts.

"Dating while trying to lose weight, clinically depressed, and tired. There's two lines of thought when it comes to dating and being happy. One is that you need to be happy with yourself before dating as it's not the responsibility of the other person to make you happy. This paints your partner as more of a supplement to your already great life. The other comes from Plato who insists we're not whole until we find our soulmate.

&gt;*Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature. Each of us, then, is a ‚Äòmatching half‚Äô of a human whole‚Ä¶and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him.*

With that being said, I'm not happy. I'm overweight, clinically depressed, tired, and unmotivated. Appealing to the opposite sex? Absolutely not, but luckily for me, I don't open with that on dating apps. I wonder, is there truth to Plato's idea of love? I would think so as finding someone to do things with would alleviate the depression and cooking with each other would stop all the takeout. There'd also be someone there to hold you accountable for your actions.

Anyone experience it firsthand? Has your partner made you a better person or were you already a good person beforehand?

P.S. I'm in treatment for my issues.

But she has a coworker male best friend - that in all honesty, he‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs awesome. Based on our few interactions, he‚Äôs a genuine guy. And I‚Äôm jealous of him. 

He can make my partner laugh in ways I‚Äôve never seen. They‚Äôre constantly smiling at each other. Any time he talking, she‚Äôll perk up and listen to his every word.

Because of prior experience with being cheated on, I have insecurities around ‚Äòcompeting‚Äô with other men in partner‚Äôs lives.

She has not given me any reason to doubt her and I know this is a me issue that I need to work on.

I asked her why they never sought each other romantically. She said it‚Äôs because they practically grew up together and sees him as a brother. Totally valid and rational.

However, my ex cheated on me with her ‚Äúbrother‚Äù so it‚Äôs hard for me to let this go mentally and I don‚Äôt want to sabotage our beautiful relationship.

"Mein Freund erz√§hlt Dinge weiter, die nie passiert sind 


Ich wei√ü garnicht wo ich anfangen soll. Ich (18) bin mit meinen Freund (17) schon seit knapp 3 Jahren zusammen. In letzter Zeit ist er sehr komisch und desinteressiert mir gegen√ºber geworden, fr√ºher haben wir uns oft gestritten wenn ich mal einkaufen gehen wollte oder ich 10min zu sp√§t von der Arbeit kam. Selbst wenn ich mal etwas zu lange duschen oder auf zu Toilette wa wurde er sauer. Er hat mir absolut alles erz√§hlt, wa nie herablassend und wollte immer mit mir etwas machen. Er hat mich √ºberall zu seinen Freunden mit mitgenommen und ich habe die ersten 6 Monate der Beziehung niemanden treffen d√ºrfen au√üer ihn. Also es war wirklich extrem. 

Darum geht es aber nicht, ich habe wegen den st√§ndigen Streits und weil ich absolut nix machen darf mit ihm vor ca 4 Monaten Schluss gemacht. Er meinte er √§ndert sich und wir sind wieder zusammen gekommen.

Er hat sich ge√§ndert, innerhalb eines Monats war ich ihm komplett egal. Ich durfte nicht mehr mit zu seinen freunden, generell ist er mit mir nicht raus gegangen. Er hatte immerwieder  andere ausreden parat. Ich musste ihn jedes Mal 3-4 Stunden wort w√∂rtlich anbetteln und weinen dass er sich mit mir trifft, ihn mit Sex, bestelltem essen, Zigaretten oder Drogen locken, oder ihm drohen dass die Beziehung bald vorbei ist wenn das so weiter geht. Jetzt k√∂nnte man sagen, ja er hat einfach keine Lust mehr auf die Beziehung, aber immer wenn er gemerkt hat ich bin dabei Schluss zu machen schreibt er mir Paragrafen wie sehr er mich doch liebt und will dass ich vorbei komme, weint und verspricht mit mir die Tage auf ein Date gehen so wollen. Nur um mir dann am abgemachten Tag kurzfristig zu sagen er hat doch gerade kein Bock, bleibt bei seinen Freunden und dass ich aufh√∂ren soll zu heulen weil ihn das ja nervt. teilweise hat er mir VON SEINER HAUST√úR weg geschickt. 

Mit mir redet er nicht √ºber was ihn in der Beziehung st√∂rt und seine Freunde m√∂gen mich alle nicht weil er denen jedes mal eine komplett falsche Geschichte erz√§hlt, lieber mit denen redet. Ich dachte, er erz√§hlt die Dinge eben aus seiner Sicht.

Die Tage habe ich bei √ºbernachtet und ich wei√ü das ist nicht richtig, aber ich wa an deinem Handy. Ich hatte langsam das Gef√ºhl dass ein anderes m√§dchen der Grund f√ºr sein Verhalten ist, immer wenn ich es angesprochen habe wurde er sauer und hat sein Handy versteckt. Au√üerdem wollte ich schauen was er √ºber mich erz√§hlt und wie er sich f√ºhlt. Ich bin eine Person die nichts b√∂se nimmt, ich wollte wirklich nur mal seine Sicht verstehen. Andere Frauen habe ich nicht gefunden, aber sehr viele Chats mit meinem Namen. Er hat seinen Freunden erz√§hlt ich h√§tte ihn mehrmals Betrogen. Er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich habe ihn oft beleidigt und ich h√§tte ihn geschlagen. Er hat Bilder von blauen Flecken geschickt und meinte ich w√§re das gewesen. Einmal hat er sein Handy im Streit kaputt gemacht, er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich h√§tte es kaputt gemacht weil ich einen Chat mit seiner Schwester gefunden h√§tte und eifers√ºchtig gewesen w√§re. Ich wa davor noch nie an seinem Handy. Er meinte ich w√ºrde ihm verbieten feiern zu gehen, seine Freunde zu sehen und habe raus gefunden dass er sehr oft im Club wa oder nachts im Park feiern. Ich wei√ü nicht warum er das alles heimlich gemacht hat, ich habe ihm noch nie gesagt dass ich etwas dagegen habe und das habe ich auch nicht. Er hat sehr oft geschrieben ich h√§tte Schluss gemacht, w√§re mit Jungs drau√üen und betrunken. Fast allen seinen Freunden hat er am gleichen Tag geschrieben sie sollen mich auf insta blocken oder von der Story blocken. Er hat auch Freundinnen von sich geschrieben dass ich den Kontakt verbiete, welche die ich pers√∂nlich kenne und befreundet bin. Mir ist das so peinlich dass er so etwas behauptet. 

Ich habe auch Audios gefunden in denen er erz√§hlt er hat garkein Bock mehr auf mich und sich freut wenn die Beziehung vorbei ist weil er dann endlich wieder der Playboy sein k√∂nnte der er eigentlich ist und er nicht an die wahre Liebe glaubt. Das w√§re alles nur eine teenage Beziehung und die wahre Liebe kommt ja sp√§ter. 
Falls das seine ehrlich Meinung ist akzeptiere ich das nat√ºrlich, aber mir erz√§hlt und k√§mpft er eben f√ºr etwa komplett anderes und verachtet Leute mit dieser Meinung. 

Diese Dinge schreibt er erst seit dem er so extrem kalt (seit der Trennung) geworden ist, alles davor waren Texte in denen er sagt dass er mich liebt, sich freut mich zu sehen oder in denen er wirklich nach Rat wegen Streits fragt. 

Ich wei√ü nicht was das soll, absolut nichts davon ist wahr. Diese Sachen sind alle komplett ausgedacht. Was soll ich jetzt machen ? Ich kann ihm nicht sagen dass ich an seinem Handy war, er w√ºrde zurecht komplett ausrasten und das vertrauen w√§re kaputt. Bitte nicht blump ,,einfach Schluss machen‚Äú, wir verstehen uns eigentlich sehr gut und haben sehr sch√∂ne Momente zusammen, lachen und haben Spa√ü. Das Waren jetzt ausschlie√ülich die schlechten Dinge.

"It's only toxic if you treat people like shit. If you date someone who is a type of person you say sou won't date becasuse someone told you it was ""toxic"" not to and you are miserable about it adnd you treat that person like shit then that's toxic. If you didn't date those people that YOU know YOU don't want and treat the people that you want great then that's non toxic. 

You might not agree about someone's age preferences, single-mom exclusion, race exclusion, size exclusion, etc., however sexual and romantic attraction is irrational. There is literally no logical foundation in human attraction, which is a good thing. But just declaring it as ""toxic"" ""hate"" or predatory is just irresponsible, after all people's lives have been ruined by people just throwing those terms around.

If I said I don't  wan to date a single mom, and have sex with a woman who has given birth to a baby especially since I don't want my firs tome to be wiht a single mom, it would only be toxic if I DATED a single mom and would refuse sex and treated her like garbage.

If I had gotten a girl pregnant and she said that she wanted to keep the baby despite my reasons and said that I would not have to pay child support and I wasn't on the birth record, and I stayed with her, refused sex and treated her like garbage over it then THAT would be toxic. 

If I dated a girl who was overweight but refused to sleep with her and called her all kinds of names instead of simply not dating her or try to help her become healthy then THAT would be TOXIC.

If I dated a girl from a race or was bi-racial with a race I don't want to date and I called her derogatory names and cheated on her with ""white"" women than that would be toxic. And make me a cheating asshole. 

If I dated a18 year old at 34(age at the time of this writing) or 37 (the other person, I am going to talk about) So what? That does not make one a ""Predator"" or a pervert or whatever. 

There was this woman who was 37 and she was married to a woman who was 18 who did something that she found highly offensive, none of my business what it was but the people in the thread were just bombarding this poor woman with predator accusations based on the age gap alone without even knowing the relationship dynamic. Calling an adult, a predator for dating a younger adult based on age alone is evil full stop. Now if she was trolling around for 18-year-olds to date just because she perceived them as ""easy"" then that would be predatory. That's the definition of a predator. 

I said earlier that since I have never had a girlfriend, I'd like to date someone who is younger and would be objectively more attractive and I threw in the 18-22 range and I got the most insane comments, despite the fact I am not looking for them for any type of easy factor, I have just observed that those ages have the most physically attractive girls. These are legal adults. People vary in maturity at all ages but you would have to actually get to know them in order to see where they are at. 

Apparently it might not make for a ""Lasting relationship"" but why would a 34-year-old who has never dated and does not have a ""career"" or got to sow his oats want to set himself up for a 6-10 or even lifetime relationship the first time around, that's too much too fast and online (Tinder) I expanded my maximum age to 29. 

Those ages 18-29 have the least single moms, the least ""Jaded"" and the least emotional baggage. and most of the girls I have swiped yes to have been white women in the 22-26 years old range. People Panic about age alone without even considering it's the mentality of the people involved that determines whether it is predatory or not. 

If I found a girl who was 18 or even 17 by happenstance and we just liked and respected each other and set up appropriate boundaries and communicated, and decided to wait to do the deed clearly than there's no problem.

Hell to some wanting to have had more than 1 GF before you turn 40 is toxic too, it would only be if i lied to the girl and broke up with her making an excuse instead of being honest that we are not going to be super long term.

Not wanting to be married or have children is also not toxic, regardless of religion.

Never wanting to date your own race is not toxic if you simple are just not physically and emotionally attracted to your race. I simply am just not sexually attracted to black women, I don't harbor any hate and I don't treat them any different than anyone else, and even if I was into all races 99% of the people with the same interests and hobbies and beliefs as me have been white or other anyway and therefore would be on my radar to date.

Plus dating from a closer net type of community is just TOO familiar, and too the same, Its basically like a black version of Shiva baby to me in my community, it's normal to exclusively attracted to opposites, you learn more about the world that way. 

I love girls from Slavic countries with their lilting accents soft round faces and their down to earth despite being drop dead gorgeous demeanor. Apparently, that's toxic too.

Not everyone is a fetishist, predator who needs to sit on a bench, racist, fatphobe, homophobe, transphobe or ageist for who they want to date. You need to stop this shit today.

"I just want to be someone's priority... Hey hey! I've recently been thinking a lot about *why* I want to be in a relationship because I've always felt a sort of desperation behind it. I finally came to the conclusion that it's pretty much solely because I want to be prioritized.

I'm extremely extroverted and thus have a huge network of friends, many who I consider myself very close to. 90% of the time, I feel great and like I don't even need to date because I can always ask one of my friends to do fun date-like activities that I'd do with a bf/gf. Honestly, many of my friends *feel* like a significant other to me (minus like...sex lol) so it's great to have them around. But it's the rare times when I ask one of these close friends to make plans and they turn me down in order to do something with *their* significant other that send me straight to sad land. 

Like, I totally get it and they obviously should prioritize their partner, but it's just like damn...I'll always be #2 to everyone if I'm single. There's no one I can 100% outright rely on to be there for me. That thought makes me sad, then I get anxious, then I start frantically dating.

He said he wanted to take things slow, but he was the one who wanted to spend every night together and bring his kid to meet me a few times, and would even leave his dog at my house. I did tell him about a month into it that we should slow down a bit on the time together or else I would get attached but it was going so well so I took his drive to spend time together as a good sign. 

I was having a rough week last week and told him I wasn‚Äôt doing so well and needed some support and he pulled away and ended it the next day, stating he was ‚Äútoo tired with his job‚Äù and unable to treat me how I deserved.

"late bloomer dating TLDR: late bloomer \[30m\] told a date I wasn't feeling our connection on 4th date. I feel i spoke to soon and wasted an opportunity for intimacy and connection, which has been extremely rare in my life.

Just venting I guess but I'm \[30m\] a late bloomer and only started dating late in my 20's. I had my first proper dating and romantic experience (4 months dating together) earlier this year but ended things because I couldn't see it going long term.

I had my second romantic experience recently (met on bumble). We hooked up on the second date and it was extremely passionate, like playing out all my fantasy's. On the 4th date we spent a full day out together. I planned a really nice date and it went really well but in the back of my mind there was a small bit of doubt. We get back to my house and end up having really deep conversations about dating, love etc, and I blurted out that i wasn't really feeling our connection as much on this date. She was extremely shocked, and we talked it out a while and she revealed that she had strong feelings for me and I was the first guy to make her forget about her ex. But ultimately there was no going back from my words, and eventually she gave me a hug, thanked me for being honest and left. We had planned to have a take away and romantic evening that night.

A week later and i'm (selfishly i know) massively regretting my decision - i keep playing it over and over again in my head. I feel like I should have held back my feelings and take more time to figure out. All my life i've craved companionship, intimacy and connection, and I threw it all away with an off the cuff remark. Don't get me wrong I don't think we were soul mates, but I really shouldn't be turning away opportunities for connection like this. 

It feels like a really odd place to be 30 and only just experiencing relationships.

"I think it's a red flag when a woman doesn't have male friends None of the Flairs matched what I'm trying to say, this is just an opinion.

I know the prevailing theory is often people being jealous and people saying they don't want partners with friends of the opposite sex, but I think it's a little weird when women don't have any male friends. Obviously there are exceptions to everything, and sometimes it may not necessarily just be that she doesnt want to have any male friends, but I think for most people having friends of the opposite sex is healthy and promotes growth and gives you insight from outside of your worldview. 

Personlly, I'd be more turned off by a woman who has no male friends than a woman who has some (not that either would turn me off)

"Problems of dating So I will talk about the dating life of the current generation and problems of it.
As I know from various  studies young men are having less sex with every year. By some statistics I came to the conclusion that it happens because some small percent of guys are getting the attention of all girls and all the other guys are getting nearly nothing. That top guys who get all the girls get overwhelmed by the amount of options they have and instead of getting a nice long term relationships they start just having one night stands with those girls or having some short term relationships with them just for sex. It results in girls saying that ""all guys are the same"" and ""all they want is sex"", but in reality all the other guys who just want a good healthy relationship can't get it and start hating on girls because of it. Also lots of guys get desperate and start ""simping"" for attractive girls or lower their standards to get at least something. That results in girls ego increasing even more and them only paying attention to top attractive guys which leads us to the start of conversation and gives us the full circle.

"No amount of self-work and healing will grant you the love of your life This might be a hot take and not everyone will agree with me, but not amount of self-work, healing and being ""ok"" on your own will bring you the right person for you. 

I'm so sick and tired of hearing all these sob stories like ""I was in an abusive relationship, hopeless thinking I'd never meet someone"" and then after 3 months they meet the love of their lives because ""they worked on themselves and weren't looking"". 

I think also blaming the woman takes away the responsibility of a man - if he's a bad guy: it's your fault because you don't love yourself. 

Not because he's an idiot. Not because he's abusive and needs therapy. Not because he's an overall jerk. It's YOUR fault, because YOU allowed it. 

Now, let's say you find a good guy. You hear how lucky you are and how much you deserve it after all you've been through. It's almost like: good thing you went through all that trauma and abuse so it would lead you to a decent man. 

Instead of: holding men accountable for their actions. 

They'll say when you least expect it, someone shows up. But if you're not expecting it, then how did you allow this person to enter your life in the first person? Surely, a little bit of you was expecting it. I think that's another way of shaming single people who want a relationship, like, ""look at me, if you stopped acting so desperate you'd find your person like I found mine, because I wasn't looking because I'm super indenpendent"". And then you actually look at their relationship and the woman is super submissive or the guy is a door-mat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to stop looking. I've deleted dating apps and I'm currently not talking to anyone. I'm focusing on my goals, I'm spending time with loved ones and I'm taking up hobbies. 

Do you know what's been happening during this time in the romance department? Absolutely-fucking-nothing. You know what that brought me in this time? Two men in already relationships - one of them cheated and I found out later and the other one told me he was in an open relationship AFTER he pursued and kissed me. So yeah, wow. Even when I'm not looking, the trash finds me. 

Now, I'm not the most attractive woman in the world but I'm not bad looking either. I can say with confidence I'm better looking than a lot of other women. I know looks aren't everything, but let's start with that. Apart from that I know I had a lot of qualities. 

Yes I sound bitter, jaded and burnt out. And that's because I am. You can only take so much before you realize all you've been told your entire life is a lie. That going to college won't guarantee a job with good pay, that working on yourself won't guarantee meeting a partner. 

It's purely luck at the of the day. ",Independent_Mix6871,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e4w6n/no_amount_of_selfwork_and_healing_will_grant_you/,1690774039.0,0.81
"Not Sure If I want To Date Anymore Most of the women I have matched with only ask me if I wanna hookup with them. It's gotten annoying and just kinda sad. Like I'm more than just a one night stand. The women who do want a relationship with me end up talking to other dudes or end up ghosting me for whatever reason. It also doesn't help that I've been cheated on and gaslighted multiple times and because of that I've developed some serious trust issues. I've been trying to get past that but it's always hanging around in the back of my head.

As far as the girls I meet in real life they see me as some dude and never really try to have a relationship with me.

To give some background on our relationship, we‚Äôve been talking for a few months now. We were friends prior to talking, had been for about 6 months before we decided to want to be together. I‚Äôve known of her ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù (she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs toxic in her past relationship). Granted part of her toxicity comes her ex who said he had female friends himself and would be flirty with them. He didn‚Äôt make her feel secure in the relationship and had him stop hanging out with girls and then, he flipped it on her and had her not hang out with guys or girls since she‚Äôs bi. 

Now, up to this point in our relationship, we‚Äôve been good. We offer each other a lot of reassurance and she lives about an hour away from me, but with my work schedule and own tiredness, seeing each other is a struggle at times, but I do what I can to make it work. 

Recently she‚Äôs been bothered by the amount of female friends I have. I have respected the boundary she placed on not liking or heart reacting to different girl‚Äôs pictures on social media. I hardly bring up any or mention any girls cause it makes her uncomfortable. Now we are at the point of her being hesitant to be with me because of the amount of female friends I have. Given I don‚Äôt even really talk to any of them, majority of them. If anything it‚Äôs about two or three on any given day. 

I am stuck on what to do now though because I don‚Äôt want to have to drop my friends I do talk to, those I‚Äôve been friends with for years and still talk to.  I want to make this work between us but this has me stumped. She will always remain my priority and I don‚Äôt know how to have her feel/see that.

She said that not matter how hard she tried to see her husband all she saw was a fragment of the man she once married many years ago. Then she proceeded to tell me the reason she has become so cold towards me is because she has been seeking comfort with another man. She said to me when she started feeling this way she had counselling without me knowing and this led to her confiding more and more with her therapist until she grew fond of him. She told me when she was talking to him about our situation it felt like she was having the same feelings and emotions as to when we first starting dating and she couldn‚Äôt help it.

My take on the matter was quite different. Although I only had one short two year relationship

From 15-17 that ended in a friendly manner after we decided we both were going different directions in life but during that relationship I realized that from the point of the relationship being ""officially started"" and about 6-7 months after the relationship ended after I had started to get over her I didn't find other women attractive in the lustful sense I guess. Its like when speaking to a women that was attractive I guess my brain stopped processing other woman's looks for that duration so I never had the ""problem"" they had. this is kind of a contradiction but I could appreciate their beauty but it was the same as looking at a painting or the landscape after a hike are the closest things I could compare it to but their wasn't the ""attraction"" they said they have.

 Even being broke and with the amount of money he has with his unstable jobs he still make sure to always buy gas for his car to travel from his house to mine and it's quite far. Like if it is traffic he'll definitely arrive in an hour. He has big dreams but I can't see him doing much about it. 

He's a kind, patient, and caring boyfriend. He cooks for me, He drives me to and from anywhere I need to be, He always checks up on me, He's consistent except for being a provider. I'm really torn on whether I will stop or continue this relationship. I'm already at the point of my life wherein I wanna explore the world without paying double. Like if he can't afford paying for me I can always do 50/50 but it just sucks to always pay for him. He don't even mind swiping my credit card knowing I'm the only one paying for it.

"Dating advice Hello people , i hope you all having a great day !

I met this cute girl from instagram and she was near me so we had a chat and i decided to ask her out and we went on a date yesterday , she looked shy at first but we had some nice conversations , i was really hearing her out and i was excited to listen to her..

In these last months im in a need to meet a new person and find something serious and i felt something with her yesterday, im so anxious and her way of talking made me calm and relaxed.. Well , the problem is that as a text person she might reply after 12 hours or just read the message and reply after hours again.. This kinda make me feel like she isnt interested at all , the thing is whenever we actually chat she replies with a decent message and doesnt seem like she is lazy replying.. am i just insecure?

(Just to clarify she told me she dont use the phone much but she is actually always online )

and she has problem socializing ",Maleficent-Target205,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15efqji/dating_advice/,1690808838.0,1.0
Asking one of the 36 questions to get to know someone better I‚Äôm speaking to a girl from a dating app (we‚Äôve been texting) and it‚Äôs been a few weeks (we have date scheduled‚Ä¶allegedly) but I feel like I don‚Äôt know much about her so I asked if she‚Äôs close to her family or friends.

"How do I (M21) get over knowing Im not the better than her (F22) EX at sex? Guys i need alot of help for this one.

This new girl im dating is nice, has all the traits im looking for and we are really compatible atleast for now.

Today after 5 days into the relationship, we had sex and she did say it was awsome and compliments like that. 

But, like an idiot i pressed her if it was the best,  which she admitted it wasnt, nor the best sex nor the best first sex she had with one of her exes. 

Now i know i made a huge fucking mistake asking that but i thought i wouldnt get insecure about it. 

That stuff is now in my head and i know its insecurities but we are both really,  and i mean really into each other,  and she said it doesnt matter and she really did her best reassuring me. But it makes me insecure thinking i wasnt her best first sex in the relationship experience and that i wasnt able to get on that level or if i can even topple in the future the best sex she had.

Now i know this is all stupid but we are quite madly in love with eachother, its the honeymoon phase and it (Mutually) this is like a unique one in a kind, or one in a million relationship where we really clicked almost literally everywhere insanely, so i have the desire to be the best or unique i guess. 

Really need some help cause its been going over my head and i dont want to ruin this relationship.

"WTF is it with guys coming off as interested and then putting in 0 effort to actually make something happened I‚Äôve experienced this before in the past but two different guys recently made me need to come here and rant about this. I (25f) have been ‚Äútalking‚Äù (by that I mean I‚Äôve been on one date with each and they flirt w/me on IG lol i just don‚Äôt know what else to call this) that have told me they want to hangout with me again and will always like my pictures, txt me and react to my stories with heart eyes but never actually make solid plans. They will message me saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out soon‚Äù or let me know they‚Äôre in town and want to make plans but then either cancel on me last minute/never follow through with making plans. WHY?! WTF is the point of reaching out to me and make it seem like they‚Äôre interested if they aren‚Äôt actually going to do anything about it. The last straw with one of them was when he texted ME first this weekend asking if I was in town for the weekend. I told him yes and asked if he was too. He said yes and asked how long I was staying. I told him how long and then asked how long he was staying. He goes on to say he‚Äôs planning on leaving Monday so it was probably the worst time for him to try to make plans. Like okay!? Why tf are you reaching out then. Anyway I was planning on just ignoring him but my friend persuaded me into giving him the benefit of the doubt on him just being a dumb guy and said I should just let him know I‚Äôm free today (Sunday) so if he was around we should do something. I figured it was worth one more shot. So I tell him and we plan to get dinner. I wanted to set a time because I usually spend the day with my family on sundays so I wanted to know when I should be free by, he says if it‚Äôs okay for him to text me in the afternoon once he‚Äôll know he‚Äôs free so I say that‚Äôs fine. Guess who got a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to hangout tonight :/‚Äú text! This clown ü§°. Im mostly mad that I gave this guy another shot after he‚Äôs repeatedly either left me on delivered mid convo or has fallen through with plans to meet up. 

Now I‚Äôm hesitant if I should even give guy #2 a shot beyond what I already have. We‚Äôve gone on one date and I thought it went great! He was even trying to ask me when I was going to let him teach me how to skateboard and saying ‚Äúoh we should go x‚Äù and spend the day in this town nearby. After the date I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a few days which I tried not to overthink it (even tho we had been texting almost every day before the date) an a few days later I hear from him. The problem is the convo was so dry and he took hours in between to respond that I didn‚Äôt even see his last text until the next morning and didn‚Äôt respond cause the convo was dead anyway. I was going to give up on trying further because I‚Äôll admit I tend to put up very high walls now when it comes to dating because of bad experiences in the past so now if someone isn‚Äôt meeting my standards or giving me the same energy I‚Äôm giving I move on. I told my therapist about this and she told me that when im in the ‚Äúgray area‚Äù of dating I can‚Äôt expect someone to give me 100% and be head over heels over me. To give them some grace. So anyway he ends up swiping up on one of my stories saying we should hangout soon. I tell him when I‚Äôll be back in town and he says okay to txt him and let him know. So once I‚Äôm back I txt him and we chat for bit and eventually i say ‚Äúbtw I‚Äôm back in town if you‚Äôre around we should hangout!‚Äù He responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely down to hang, I‚Äôm kinda busy the next few days but I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll link before you go back‚Äú. ??? I get him being busy but I would think that he would at least TRY to solidify some plans for sometime while I‚Äôm here? Am I being crazy in thinking this seems like he‚Äôs actually not very interested at all and just dropping this.

"First time in the dating scene and I‚Äôm interested in 3 guys at once including my ex and I‚Äôm a wreck HELP. (VERY LONG) Im 21 (F) and this guy, I‚Äôll call him Jeff is 23 (M). We met at work back in April when I first started at Amazon when I was having a panic attack trying to learn how to operate the fork lift and my trainer had to grab another trainer which was Jeff, because I was doing so bad. Anyways right when we made eye contact I felt so much tension and connection with him immediately that it was ridiculous. I just chalked it out to him just doing this with everybody because to be honest he‚Äôs the most hottest guy at the warehouse. I was also in a 2 year relationship at the time that I was planning to end, but I still held my ground and remained loyal. After Jeff trained me I couldn‚Äôt get over him, I was looking for him EVERYWHERE. and everytime i did find him, he was already looking at me, and even approached me to have a random conversation and walked away hinting that he only walked in the area to speak to me. At this point I became Joe Goldberg from ‚ÄúYou‚Äù and needed to find out his last name in order to find his social media. After hours of looking, I found him and BOOM, he was in a relationship too. I felt like this was gods way of testing me. I followed Jeff, Jeff followed me back, and no further moves were made and I‚Äôm Night Shift and Jeff changed to day shift so I stopped seeing him ever since. eventually I did break up with my boyfriend (not because of Jeff) but because of how toxic we were, I fell out of love and felt like I mourned about the ending of our relationship for a very long time he cheated in the beginning and I never got over it and spent the whole relationship letting it eat me up inside and I became toxic as a whole myself. I‚Äôve been feeling guilty about breaking up with my ex ever since because until this day he is still begging for me back. I know I know a 2 year relationship I should spend time to heal right? Nope, met someone else at Amazon, we‚Äôll call him Stan 23 (M) we connected, I began to really like him and been hooking up for months. Stan was infatuated with me while I was in a relationship and I continusly rejected him and when I became single I decided to see what Stan was about. good guy, but immature. doesn‚Äôt want to take me seriously because hes too insecure about the amount of attention I get at work that he feels if he did pursue me I would break his heart. so for this, he treats me shitty but I couldn‚Äôt help but fall for Stan bc I‚Äôm not shit and always attracted to guys who play hard to get. Stan revealed to me recently that I was the second person he‚Äôs slept with, I could tell he has severe trust issues and been hurt which I can‚Äôt help but understand where he‚Äôs coming from in how he treats me. He sucks at texting me back and communicating and for this, it makes me become clingy and emotional. His reasoning for not texting back is because we always talk at work anyway. Problem with Stan, is we been talking for 3 months and Stan has never asked me out on a real date, he only did once when I was in a relationship and i rejected. when I brought this up to him he says he refuses to ask me out on a date because i rejected him in the beginning and i shouldn‚Äôt expect him to give me the same energy just because i broke up with my boyfriend. he also says he‚Äôs only off on Sundays and uses that day as his rest day but will also be quick to get a day off to hang with friends. he told me once that he doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with me more because he has feelings for me but is scared to proceed further. I‚Äôve always tried to initiate us to hangout (which I‚Äôve never done to a guy) and got rejected all 3 times I asked, and rejected by just being ignored or being told he had plans. He proceeds to accuse me of talking and seeing other guys all while trying to kiss and see me on my breaks still to chat. we talk more than we hook up by the way so I don‚Äôt think us hooking up did damage. Basically this whole thing became a situationship, in which I feared. I really like Stan, but this week I seen Jeff‚Äôs social media and noticed he was single, he began interacting with my post and I slid in his dms starting a conversation about his photography, he ended up giving me his phone number randomly and INSTANTLY asked me on a date to the movies and a restaurant. he was already doing more than Stan. Me and Jeff went on this date yesterday and I know I‚Äôm young but I‚Äôve only been done wrong by boys/men most of the time, I‚Äôve always been the one begging and wondering why I‚Äôm not good enough. Jeff did everything for me that I only dreamt of that I felt like I was in a simulation. The date was great Jeff consistently spoke about how he couldn‚Äôt get over me right when he laid eyes on me, how bad he wanted to talk to me but held himself together since he was in a relationship. He said he never saw a woman and immediately felt like that she was the person he wanted to be with until he seen me, and proceeded to plan a second date with me. Since these two guys literally both work at Amazon I couldn‚Äôt help but decide to be honest with Jeff about Stan it was eating me alive the entire date. Jeff actually appreciated this, said it was a green flag that I felt comfortable telling him and told me that he could tell I felt bad about doing it and said he‚Äôs done things with people at work too and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been 3 months and he hasn‚Äôt taken you out. I had a 10 hour shift today and work in the morning and still made time for you and we just started chatting two days ago, just think about that. And I‚Äôm not telling you this in a ‚Äúi want you way‚Äù I‚Äôm telling you as if me and you were friends that If he wanted to make time for you he would have. You need to know your worth‚Äù I was expecting to get ghosted and called a slur. instead, I was given an eye opener. Jeff stated that he only wants me and has been sending cute lengthy messages since our date and literally wants to see me everyday. This dude is literally everything I wanted in a guy. I honestly thought people like Jeff don‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed by how nice he‚Äôs treating to the point I do feel like it‚Äôs too good to be true and that he‚Äôs love bombing me but to be honest I genuinely don‚Äôt think he is but I‚Äôm stuck between 3 different guys that I‚Äôm trying to convince myself bad things about each of them so I don‚Äôt make a decision I regret. this is super unlike me as I am very much a lover girl and not the type to entertain 3 different guys at once so that might be why I feel a ton of guilt every single day I wake up and breath. My ex is all I‚Äôve ever known honestly which is the main source of my guilt of having to let him go and see him with someone else would ultimately crush me. but what im doing I know would crush him.

"Matched with someone from my high school but we don't remember each other About 2 weeks ago i matched (on bumble) with a guy and the conversation died out pretty quickly. Fast forward a week ago, i was bored and scrolling on instagram, and found his account, i realised we had quite a lot of mutual followers and most of them were from my co-ed cheerleading team, save for a couple of cheerleaders i met outside of my high school.  
I decided to hit him up on bumble on Monday and ask if he was a cheerleader, and he confirmed it. We then realise that we were both from the same high school and same team but he was 2 years my senior, there were pictures on instagram where both of us were in it, just on different ends of the photograph. Had a good laugh because neither of us recognised or remembered each other, but to be fair, it has been 6 years since leaving cheer and i think both of us looked quite different since. I was also quite introverted and quiet, and he said he was pretty lowkey back then as well. We also don't follow each other on instagram.  
We texted a little everyday since but he hasn't responded to me since the weekend (2 days ago). Kind of bummed out because i was hoping we could've met and thought it would be a funny story or at least interesting to see if we would get along or be awkward, given our ""history"".

"My feelings are in limbo over a girl I feel I can't or at least shouldn't date. So I 22M am feeling frustrated, I'm in a situation where a girl (17) started to show some interest towards me and unexpectedly I've started to catch feelings which I did not expect nor had any intention of doing so.

**(Just to make things clear the legal consenting age in my country is 16 however people can and do feel strongly around this topic both irl and on reddit and so I made it on a throw away account, and to be clear nothing has happened between me and this girl anyways).**

I meet this girl through a mutual hobby. A few months ago I started to see this one girl around the gym about one month into us seeing each other around the gym (we do a combat sport) she started to come up to me and ask if I wanted to partner up with her during training. When I first started seeing her I honestly didn't think much of her at all, to me she was just another person that I would see at training. But once we started to partner up and get comfortable with each other I unexpectedly started to see her in a different way and she started to grow on me and I can't help but feel some kind of way towards her. Every time we train together we're always having a laugh and I genuinely enjoy her presence despite her being far more experienced than I am and often times she shows me up and I be looking like a absolute beginner around her its still fun.

I don't really know what to do because I've been single all my life and recently I've gotten my life together and in the past I didn't ever get any attention from woman and only recently I've been getting some attention from some woman but this girl is the first girl within the last 6 months where a girl has been interested in me and I've had some interest in her back, but of course there's a catch and it's her age.

I feel much more confident and sure of myself and as a result I feel I'm in a position where I would be confident and comfortable with actively pursuing asking for a number and setting a date up with someone that I know has some interest in me but I don't feel comfortable with doing such with this girl due to her age and I'm not sure what the reception would be like from those around me. And so here is where I feel frustrated because I have feelings and I see her and interact with her often but I can't do anything I can't pursue her I can't get her socials or ask out because I don't think it's a good idea and so my feelings are in limbo and what screws with me even more is that there's a degree of hope. This hope comes from the fact that I really enjoy the hobby and the training that I do and I'm sure I'm going to see her long into the future (she's really into it too) and so maybe when she's older there's a chance.

But for now I'm just gonna have to be mature and have my feelings for her remain hidden in limbo and just be training friends and not flirt or make any advances towards her, which fucking sucks. I feel worse too because I struggle with dating and I don't get many opportunities and I do have the thought of ""what if I don't find no one"".  


TLDR;   
A girl likes me and I've started to like her back but she's 17 and I'm 22M and now I feel as if I cant do anything with theses feeling and I'm just gonna have to be friends and nothing more but it sucks because I don't get these feelings often and almost is never mutual. And so its like what am I meant to do with theses feelings I see her all the time and I don't think its a good idea to even think of perusing.",__-Anonymous-_,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15edgsl/my_feelings_are_in_limbo_over_a_girl_i_feel_i/,1690802663.0,0.5
"Navigating dry texting after amazing 1st date I (25f) have been texting with guy (29m) from an app for about a few days. Conversation flowed well and almost immediately set up a date for early in the following week. We meet and things went extremely well, he was super complementary and mentioned several times that he could see this becoming something more. All in all, I think our date went incredibly well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, conversation over text has turned dry since our date but I had chalked it up to having touched many topics when we meet face-to-face. We had texted me good morning and goodnight the past few days since our date, but stopped two days ago and left me on read yesterday after asking how I was. He mentioned he got sick after our date earlier this week but had at least responded once a day to me which is the part that has left me confused.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing he told me was that I was the cutest thing he had seen all week ( in reference to a picture I sent him 24 hours before ) and how he was starting to feel better but spent the day in bed on a Saturday. I was told him about how I was at a concert and the act was running late and that I hope he was feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I would just let the guy just dictate how this will play out but that hasn‚Äôt worked very well with me thus far.  I‚Äôve never had a real relationship and I feel like I‚Äôve lacked agency in my dating life thus far. I've gone on other dates with guys but never anything that went past a couple dates. Simply living on ‚ÄúIf he wanted to, he would‚Äù mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don‚Äôt want to come off as desperate but I do really like him and don‚Äôt connect with many men this way very easily. I wouldn't normally be thinking about one guy so obsessively had he not been calling me perfect and telling me that I can delete my dating apps all throughout our date. Even after, he seemed really into me until our texting suddenly got stale.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to send him a silly meme based on our date/similar interest but now I'm overthinking everything based on a previous reaction to when I sent a silly meme to a fading attraction. I feel so juvenile and I don‚Äôt know if my irl friends understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I already know the answer but...any advice? Should I just double text him, send the meme, take the hint, chill out ???

I would ask him to hang out but I'm about to travel out of the country for a week and was hoping we could meet before. :(

"Met a guy I liked and he got a gf :))) Just a little sad.  I dont meet a guy i like often, but I met a really cute and nice guy at a study group about a month ago.  Just casual first meeting, not much convo.  Last week the group had a big party and we had a lot of really great 1 on 1 conversation.  He was always matching my energy. 


 He asked me and another guy if we could all go out to coffee and dinner.  He was always complimenting me, he said I'm like in angel and he even mentioned how interesting the complexity of my natural hair color was.  How it had some red and some gold color and that he thought people would pay top dollar to have my kind of hair.  Teasing me and just being super nice.  I definitely felt like it was flirting, but when the topic came around to dating I asked the both of them if they were dating, and he said he got a girlfriend just last week.

"Legitimately curious. Really looking at it I think the biggest problem with me dating is that I don't want anything. All of the perks and benefits of having a relationship sound great but like I don't actually want anything from another person so what am I supposed to ask for? It always came up on facebook. Mostly women, some men. What do I want in a relationship? Nothing. So there's nothing to really talk about for them because I don't look for validation from hardly anyone. Online dating became a huge frustrating loop of, not being rejected, but being matched and wanting absolutely nothing from another human being. I have had mental problems for a seriously long time and I've been in and out if therapy to mixed results. The things people say about talk therapy is true, it isn't very effective for people that don't trust the things you say. My first clinic refused to look into PTSD as a possibility. I know I have it now. After online dating I became incredibly jaded and just wanted to be left alone. Almost full social isolation. And in reality nobody else did anything to me. I took a part time job and I get much more social interaction than I used to. I'm realizing again that I'm more skilled with people than I credit myself.

I just don't know what I'm supposed to ask if, emotionally, there's nothing I need to ask for. I've heard worse stories of judgemental behaviour for others online I just have no control over my anger so I get swept up in the adrenaline and ride the high. People treat sex like it's the be all end all of everything ever but I couldn't care less about not having the attention. I hate having attention. It doesn't feel good, it feels anxious. It feels incredibly anxious. So anxious that I stop filtering my speech and start speaking like a madman. I've tried the meds, it just doesn't go away. 

I don't know hardly anywhere I can go where people would really like me. When I talk about things like Elden Ring here there are already people I 100% know they like it. I don't hardly want to talk about my hobbies with anyone in the world which means I don't want to interact with anyone either.",Reavere312,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ecq1p/legitimately_curious/,1690800453.0,1.0

"Am I moving on too quickly? Hi I'm f/23 I just got out of a 4¬Ω year relationship for about three month now. I'm someone who's pretty good with processing my emotion, during the relationship we had our ups and down but it was mostly down. Long story short about half a year before our relationship end I felt like I was already 'done' but was holding onto hopes of him changing so I stayed. So when we broke up (I just knew it was coming) of course I cried and I was sad but I wasn't completely distraught, I was fine after a week. Now fast forward to today I've been recently talking to a guy for a month now and he's genuinely I feel like is a great guy. In recent weeks he's been dropping hints to me the signal is CLEAR. I am happy, I really do like him, and I feel like I'm ready but I feel like my last relationship is holding me back? I guess, it felt like I'm moving on too fast and I feel horrible since it was an almost 5 years relationship too.

"Went on a terrible date So I went on a date with this girl yesterday, we were talking for the past two weeks and everything was going great. Right into the date we were talking and I asked her about her internship and how she gets to college like if she drives or anything. She said she got a DUI one year ago and that kind of was a turn off for me but I believing seconds chances. I look up her mugshot and she got arrested for poss of controlled substance and DUI. Back to the date we decide to go bowling to just do a fun activity which was cool and all but it was really hot in there and I wanted to leave after 30 minutes so we decide to go get dinner, after that she asked me if I can drive her home because she forgot her charger and ID and the she texts me go down the street hurry right now so I‚Äôm like what the hell, I look in my mirror and her mom is chasing after her and stops in front of my car and I hit the brakes and she says are you seeing her I said yeah we are just going out to dinner she then read my license plate out loud to me and said she was going to call the cops and that her daughter has a active case but nothing happened with the police or anything. At the dinner date she is barely talking and is just looking at random things as I‚Äôm talking to her and she just starts laughing, turns out the date turned out to be $130 because of a stupid $30 service charge which is whatever. During the date she did not ask me one question about myself at all and seemed like she was in and out of reality on what was happening that she was on a date with someone  I am considering giving it one more shot but I am not sure. We also got yogurt after which was $15 and she did not pay for that At all. I just think the dui is a huge red flag. PS did not even get a kiss or anything during the date which isn‚Äôt a big deal but it would have been nice knowing that I drove 30 miles to pick you up take you out and spend like $160 on a date.

"Was I overdramatic in giving an ultimatum before we even met? Man there really is no guidebook to dating, I don't know what I'm doing at all. 25 F.

I matched with this guy about 3 weeks ago on Tinder, he gave me his snap and number after a couple days and we've been chatting most days since then. Nothing too deep (thought I should leave most of the getting-to-know stuff for the first date), but we have lots of interests in common and talked a lot about video games, DnD, work, and just how are days and weekends have been going, very surface level but he seemed interested enough. Even brought up doing a one-shot DnD campaign with me to show me the ropes as I haven't played much. We had made plans about a week ago to meet up this past Thursday somewhere halfway between us, and he seemed down for it, although maybe slightly apprehensive. 

An hour before I was planning on leaving on Thursday, he messaged saying he had to cancel to go to the Dr for a rash, apologized, and said he'd like to reschedule for the weekend. I made a mistake here in not asking for specifics, and I just said I totally understand, would totally be down for either day this weekend. We chatted maybe once or twice a day since then, I asked how his skin has been healing and he said it's getting better. I considered being more direct about what day and time we could meet but I felt since he was the one who cancelled and is healing, that he would let me know. 

This is where I think I fucked up. He didn't open my message from yesterday all day today (it's now Sunday, the weekend has come and passed, no mention of pushing the date further into the week or anything; he suggested the weekend, never followed up). I don't feel like playing a guessing game or continuing on just surface level chatting with a stranger, so I send him a very kind message just basically saying ""hope you're healing well, wanna let you know I'm leaving it up to you if we meet, I'm still interested but am looking to meet people irl, so if it won't happen or you're not interested I'll be saying farewell. No hard feeling or pressure, just wanted to be straightforward with you."" He opened this a couple hours ago and hasn't responded.

I know this is stupid because we haven't even met and it's just a Tinder match, but I want to know if this was an inappropriate move on my part or if I should have just let it be. It's almost definitely over with this guy, but I wanna know what to do if I encounter this in the future.

"Being a ""slow"" man...and wanting to fix it. I'm writing this after breaking up from a longer relationship and almost two years of being sort of miserably single: I'm not gonna lie. I should not have a problem meeting women. And I don't. I meet lots of women. I'm a tall, above average looking dude who owns a successful business in a creative field (32M). I have good fashion sense, I'm fit and like the outdoors, surfing, skiing, sailing, etc. I play in a band, I have a masters degree, a nice apartment in the centre of my city and have a lot of friends. Me writing this opening might piss some people off but it's relevant to discuss my situation I think. I live a happy life in almost every aspect, business is good, exciting creative projects are happening, but my love life is miserable. So what's the problem?

Women get frustrated with me. Or confused. They think I'm slow. I grew up with a lot of female friends so hanging out talking to girls come natural to me. Maybe too natural. I meet women, either through friends, social events, work or they just come up and strike a conversation at a caf√© or a bar or whatnot. And I respond. I like people so it's almost always a good time. The point of confusion happens after a while... contrary to what my bragging opening paragraph might signal I'm naturally a quite polite and humble person. I feel comfortable around women but I don't naturally code them as sexual partners. They might be a new friend. Or a new business partner. Even when I meet someone that I find attractive and might give me signals of interest my brain is slow when it comes to get into the mindset to make a flirty move and take the conversation from friendly to intimate or flirty/sexual. I typically want to hang out with someone two or three times before I'm there. I've come to understood that women get frustrated (several women I've had relationships say so, *""yeesh, lucky for us I was patient, I didn't know if you even wanted me"" ‚Äì my ex*) because I'm so slow. My experiences this past year is that the women I meet seem to except something else. Something quicker. Faster. Maybe it's my background that might lead them to expect a more aggressive behaviour. I'm not slow in business. I'm successfull in leading big projects with difficult people and I'm not a pushover. But something is different when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. That's another side of me.

I was just crushed because a beautiful girl with similar interests and a great mind that I like a lot ghosted me after our first real date. We've known eachother for 6 months through a working project where she came in and consulted. We had a strong connection and from the moment we met I understood she liked me. She would look deep into my eyes with the prettiest smile and come around and say hi when she didn't have to. It was clear that there was undertones of sexual interest. However, because we worked together and had a great collaboration going I didn't want to f\*ck that up and be unprofessional, so I waited until when the project was over before I asked her out. We had a great time and hung out for a whole day until late night, just winging it, doing various fun summery things around town and talking about life, ending up with a dinner and wine. When the time was late I called it a night, followed her to the subway and got that long hug where I felt that she wanted me to do a move. She did not want to let go. But I wasn't there. I wasn't ready. I asked her out again after a couple of days and I was sad to realize she's been ghosting me since. It frustrates me. It hurts me. I really like her and I feel like i dissapointed her. She's progressive but I know she likes conservative gender roles and I think she might've wanted someone more aggressive. She might've thought that I was someone else. Someone more like I am at work. I mean it might be something completely different, she might be in love with someone else or whatnot, she might've just used me for business reasons and wanted to see if I was down to f\*ck, but this happens over and over again so it's not just one case. I've met so many women after my break-up that I like and my brain picks up might be open to something more but by the time I'm there and am ready to explore it more they've already lost interest or misinterpreted me as not interested back. She's not the only one, there's been many other situations similar like this but she was extra special to me.

I don't have a straight question here but rather wanted to share my frustration and hear what you guys have to say, women and men. I guess there are bigger questions here as well about whats expected from men and women and gender roles in society and flirting. Do you have to be the one who makes the aggressive first move as a guy? I don't think ever a girl has kissed me first. I might point out that I live in a Scandinavian country so flirting is a bit more lowkey here than in some other places. It also might be that I hang out with too many women who have a certain view of successful men and how they ""should"" behave...they might be attracted to power or status and associate other character traits when it comes to flirting than I have. I'm open for critique and to hear that I'm all wrong:) I'm afraid that I will miss out on romance in life if I don't change and pick up on things faster. I want to fall in love with a nice person and have kids. What do you think? I'm considering trying to brake my pattern and force myself to try and be flirty quicker than what I would usually feel is ok when I feel it's wanted from the other person...but I think it will feel really unnatural to me. We'll see. Hit me with your thoughts.",mrcsrnne,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dtydn/being_a_slow_manand_wanting_to_fix_it/,1690745095.0,0.94
"Should i keep waiting? So, we met each other like a week ago already and since the beginning she directly said she liked me, etc

But she barely answered like, she talked to me a few minutes, and then she dissapeared the whole day until the next day near the same hour

Then she never answered back, until i asked her if she still wanted to talk (She answered a few hours later almost night), she like i said still acted extremely interested in what we could become together and said she's been really busy lately and she can't answer but that she promises me she won't let me go and doesn't want to stop talking, she told me that on Tuesday but hasn't answered since then after we talked a bit

So, i don't know lol Maybe i'm just fucking stupid and I'm just making things up to think she doesn't wants to talk (I have anxiety so, maybe that's why lmao)

"Got a date with someone I already talk to a lot Alright so I (m18) matched with this guy (m21) on tinder. We hit it off straight away with getting to know each other, a couple weeks after that we moved onto a different  app and started calling and playing games with each other every day for the past month, other than when he went on holiday for a week which for me was a test to see if he would still put effort into talking to me whilst he was gone, which he did!

"Fiance going to bars- am I controlling? Also venting. I know a couple of languages and English is not my first language. Sorry in advance. 

I'm so sorry for venting but also need advice if im being controlling or what is going on with me. my girl n I had a agreement on no guys(4 her) no women 4 me. and no bars or strip clubs for any of us. Unless couple friends/co workers ect. She's also bipolar and has had a rough road of abuse in every way and being or ending homeless  as well as being a pushover and being taken advantage- I lost her for half a year in the streets of Oakland due to going in Mania...anyways going back to the main story. 

She met online a women and met at a bar which led to meeting another person from 4pm all the way to almost 4am in the morning she disregarded time and boundary we set tohether with excuses and her stories are not well constructed she kept talking to me about being at the girls house and she keeps saying he between the convos and so I said who's he? You keep saying he. Basically, she confessed that she was talking to guys only at the end before she left that woman's house. They were supposedly walking in as she was leaving and they over heard her talking about anime. She got extremely mad at me for asking who's he and how everything happen with he and started screaming at me, saying I ruined her night and she was so happy. Also she said she told them that im a big anime watcher so they know she was with someone but only after i asked questions. threaten me that she can't be with someone like me and that those are her new beasties. Something I learn about this new friend of hers she hangs out is that she goes to bars to pick up younger man and take them home. They even aperently pick up some guys at safeway that they remember from the bar(her new friends) And even today, she still trowing it to my face bringing it up, saying and getting mad at me and yelling at me, belittling me and threatening me with leaving and breaking my stuff or pc- I'm a gamer. 

Little more about me. I'm extremely patient and I try to speak with care and understanding now I do suspect that maybe she's heading towards mania. Last year when this happen she started to be  narsaccist- bunch of gas lighting and I thought it could he because of stress and being drugged by people she trusted.
 The reason why I am talking about this is because 

1. vent. 
2.you guys might have pointers in what direction I might take since there's wiser people out.

I did like one thing- she kept updating me and calling me throughout the day at the bar which I find weird- even call me if she can talk to a guy who was autistic and in a wheelchair.  but the only thing I asked her to do was to let me know when she got to said places fine with a address incase something happens to her. 

She did call me and invited me to come at like 2am when I was asleep and need to get up early at 6am. 

Also we agreed she was going to ask her docs if she can drink with taking meds for her bipolar. Which she never did when I asked her today.

Update for people who don't know the past and / or what's bipolar. There are different kinds, but one of them is hypermedia.

One. Her due to trust issues. But it's not even me either her whole family and the docs/ therapist tell her that she shouldn't be going out late nights or partying. She has a history of hyper mania. If you don't know what that is. Imagine this. She feels like she's God. She can walk in the street in front of cars. Fight people or even beat up her own family. And or one time, she said she was on fire in the middle of the street burning. When it was all on her head. 6 months straight of this. Being in the streets being raped
 Beat up and traumatized all because she wanted to have fun and smoked some weed, which was laced and trusted a dude. A drug that made her go into a mania episode. I wish it would be a week or a month, but no. I had to leave my job to go find her in the streets day and night. She kept getting out of the mental hospital because they thought she was just a druggy I had to fight with court to make her owned by the state, so she gets forced treatment. I'm just referring to why I'm a bit off. BTW, she just told me I'm not allowed to go bars because I could do something out of spite. Wtf????

"Have I been played? I'm a 17F and talking to the 17M i met approximately 4 months ago. He would be very engaging from the beginning, on text, in real life etc. We continued to go out but there would be times his behaviour would be cold or distant. But this would quickly go away and he showed large signs of affection (kissing my forehead, holding my hand, more subtle ways to be affectionate). He even seriously wanted our parents to meet and me to go over to his place etc but I felt uncomfortable. We weren't dating though it was kind of like an affectionate friendship that seemed a bit like a relationship. There were some times he insinuated making what we had ""official"" but I kind of brushed it aside because I wasn't ready for that yet. 

When I last saw him 3 weeks ago he gave me a letter, before i went overseas, where he confessed that he believes that he is in love with me and it were the kind of love where he wouldn't mind spending the rest of his life with me. I also sort of brushed it aside but insinuated that I felt something back but never a clear response.(He simply insinuated he would wait) And since then, he hasn't been texting the same at all, even taking 15 hours to respond when he isn't even busy. And when I fail to respond he doesn't even bother. He completely seems to have lost interest in 3 weeks of me being overseas but it seems he still wore my hairband around his wrist when he goes out.

"He lied on the first date So I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for two weeks now (M32 &amp; F28), and recently I found out that he told a little lie on our first date. I don‚Äôt really remember much from this conversation, but apparently I asked him how long he had been single for and he told me it had been a few months. 

Yesterday we were talking about past relationships and I find out that he actually just became single a week and a half before we met. It was just a short 5 month relationship that wasn‚Äôt super healthy by the sounds of it - so that part doesn‚Äôt bug me at all. What does bug me is the fact that he lied about the timeline so the truth wouldn‚Äôt scare me off. 

I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs kind of an awkward question to be asked on a first date (especially when you‚Äôre as newly single as he is), but I‚Äôm looking for something serious and longterm, so I often ask serious questions. 

He has since explained the situation to me entirely, admitted he lied and apologized a million times. We have had a lot of open communication about it, but it still really bugs me that he lied. I‚Äôm a super honest and open person and desire to find that in a longterm partner as well. Things have been going amazing with this guy otherwise, but I‚Äôm currently taking a few days to process this.

"I am terrible at showing affection or expressing my emotions, and I'm scared I might ruin my relationship. I've only been dating my current girlfriend for a month now, but I'm completely in love with her. I get excited every time I see her, and I love every minute we hang out or go on dates.

On our third date, when I made things official, she told me a little more about her perspective about the relationship. She's been interested in me for a while, since we first met, and every time we make plans, she always tells me that she's fine with anything, as long as we're together.

The problem arose around last week, when we went out for coffee. I had met her parents just before, and I got along very well with her whole family; however, when we got coffee, she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that I always seem emotionally distant. She also told me that she didn't know if I really liked her, and that I never talk about how I feel.

Growing up, I never showed or received much affection from anyone. I had trouble socializing with people, and I never really had the chance to talk about my feelings, so I learned to just keep everything to myself. I have a habit of bottling up my emotions, and not asking for help with anything. If ever anyone does ask me whats wrong, I just say ""I'm fine"" and move on. I've never told anyone I loved them, and I haven't hugged anyone in about 10 years, including family members. 

This has made many people angry with me, and I tend to not really care, until I met my current girlfriend. I want to tell her that I love her, but I don't know how. I want to show her that I care, that I like her, and I want to be open with her about my feelings, but I have no clue what I'm doing, and I don't want to lose her.

How do ppl just casually date and not get their heart broken? I was talking to this guy for a week and I know its gonna sound insane like I have menatl issues but he was special ok the only one I ever connected to on an app like that...and he said the same to me. We talked all day everyday about everything including trauma and family issues which obvisley made us feel close as well normal things. Maybe I wasnt in love but I think i was starting to fall for him. But he ghosted me and it shattered my heart he disnt even say I'm not interested anymore. Tbh he had a fair reason.....I just ended my past situationship 2 days to matching with him and I told him I wanted to get tested for stds first just to make sure before meeting him.....I thought I was being responsible but the thought that I might have something turned him off so much he ghosted me. He was special I dont talk to  others on the app like that the convo is more surfacey. But regardless it seems most or alot of ppl just jump into a new realtionship every few months and idk how ppl can do that without having their heart ripped out. Maybe it's me but I dont feel safe with anyone so I only let a select few even know me for real I guesse so when things end (even by my choice) it hurts so much.

"Anyone feel like dating is too fast paced? I might just be naive, I'm 26M never had anyone (I'm quiet, don't like going out etc) and just got rejected after a couple dates and talking for a bit over a month, hung out a few other times.

I just feel like from reading lots of articles and posts/comments that people don't give anyone the time or effort to get to know one another. Maybe I'm just not a good people reader but I feel 1-2 dates is not enough unless of course there is an immediate reason to not see this person anymore. 

Another thing is the ""spark"". I feel like people are going around only focusing on feeling that immediate connection, looking for instant gratification and focusing on the reasons to not date them. Again, people have every right to do this but I feel dating apps/society/movies have given people unrealistic expectations of partners because they can just simply message the next person on their phone. But saying that, I can understand that people don't want to waste time. But then again, I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.

She told me she felt safe and comfortable and that I was a breath of fresh air for once and said I'm an awesome person etc. We had some things in common but she didn't feel a strong spark so we should just be friends. I respect that but I just don't really understand it. Like, why not try and build a connection and look for reasons to be with this person until the reasons to not date them overwhelm those. Try and make you're own spark and build your own fire, because I feel like that is way more beneficial down the track if things get rough because you can fall back on your core values of what you built together rather than falling back on nothing but infatuation.

That's just my 2c anyway. Maybe I just don't understand females or I just don't have enough emotional trauma to understand people these days and my soul is a LOT older than I am üòÇ I can say I tried dating once now so I'll go back into hermit mode for a while and maybe try again in a few years",Mundane-Astronomer61,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e4a6w/anyone_feel_like_dating_is_too_fast_paced/,1690772142.0,1.0

"Why do Women Expect Commitment in this Day and Age? Been watching videos and shorts about women ranting that men are afraid of commitment. Hmmm.

So, we now live in a world where ghosting has become an accepted norm for people to end relationships. No matter the depth of that relationship. And women are the biggest users of this tactic by far. And women are more likely to break the relationship. And they are more likely to invoke frivolous reasons (because Barbie??).

"(32m) Last 4 women have each ended it with me after at least one date with some variant of ""can't be in a relationship right now"". What am I doing wrong? I've been looking for a long term relationship, but I keep finding myself in this situation where the woman says she's realized she's not looking for that.

Please tell me what I'm missing or doing wrong, what I need to fix because while they have all been very polite and thoughtful in ending it and I'm surprised and grateful they haven't ghosted me because it seems so common online. The theme of them expressing a disinterest in pursuing a serious relationship is making me wonder: **what the hell it is I'm doing wrong so consistently?** (and why is it so obvious to four different women, but not myself).

It's been after after a date with no kissing, after going to bed together on the second date, after going to bed multiple times - all different. So it's not like ""they just used you for sex"". There's no pattern, it's not like there's a behaviour or action that I've done that I can point to that makes it clear - ""ahh it's when I said this obviously egregious thing"". They all had different professions, different ages. Some there were hours of phone calls before the first date, others it was just messaging then date.

Here's the kicker though: I met all of them on Hinge, the dating app that markets itself for something more serious. How's that for irony?

The only possible common denominator left is **me** : but they have all been at pains to soften the blow with the classic ""it's not you it's me"". But 4 times in a row? Come on. Twice is a coincidence. Four times is a failure on my part.

I am honestly clueless as to what personality flaw or behaviour I'm exhibiting that is at the root of this.

In the interest of producing context but at risk of flattering myself, the only possible explanation I can fathom is these women were on dating apps without the intention of actual commitment in the first place? I base this on the fact that one of these women literally said to me in what sounds just too flattering to be true that she was ready to delete Hinge because her career was taking up too much of her time and she didn't want anyone in her life, but then I managed to grab her attention and she (with some goading from her friends) decided to see if she could make it work. But... obviously, she couldn't. If that's true I interpret that to mean I'm quite simply looking in the wrong places, which begs the question of: okay, where are the right places?

The bottom line is I'm trying to look at this as an opportunity to improve and develop further as a person. Of course I have flaws, but I don't know what is the root cause here, and therefore I'm unable to take meaningful steps to fix it - despite being eager to do so.

"Types of ‚ú®men‚ú® So we‚Äôve all heard of Schr√∂dingers cat right? That experiment? I think all of us studied about it when we were in school, no? 

But here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not JUST a cat. Confused? Let me give you an example using the world of ‚ú®dating‚ú®.

Now for those who are straight, Bi, gay or anything but a lesbian, Cis-het men is usually a category one comes across.
But in this category, there are various sub categories (kinda like the various voice modules in my head that are narrating what I‚Äôm writing, but that‚Äôs not really the point). Here are the sub categories:-

1. Fucboi - naam hi kaafi hai. Sab ko use karte  hai like baap ke Diya credit card. Who cares if the damage done is higher than the damn credit card bill? At least I have given myself some self care and confidence Na üëÄ. They will use anything and everything to get you hooked to them. And like a fresher who has just scored their first job at corporate they‚Äôre supremely adjustable depending on what they think will help them land their target. I say target because at this point we‚Äôre nothing more than a bulls eye for them. You hit the bulls eye, someone calls you daddy and then your inner Ariana Grande comes out screaming thank you next.
2. Case study : these are the men whom we talk about on group chats, with our best friends, when we catch up over drinks and then psychoanalyse the fuck out of them because daaru k baad toh bc hum hi Freud ka prot√©g√© hain. Now here‚Äôs the thing. These men could be the bestest creatures we‚Äôve ever known OR they‚Äôre the red flags üö© who inspire the commandments of the sisterhood. Does he only text you after or at exactly 2:00 am saying wyd or I miss you or u up? Behen he‚Äôs a laal jhanda. At that point other than his hormones and PP are the only things up. He‚Äôs going to go back to ignoring your existence and gaslighting you because if his loins are on fire then everything around him, including you, needs to be on fire. Does he send you a text apologising for the lack of responses because it‚Äôs been an overwhelming day and he wants to make it up to you by coming over with your favourite take away and watch your favourite movie? RUN STRAIGHT INTO HIS ARMS AND STAY THERE. &gt;insert pedro pascal‚Äôs voice&lt; he‚Äôs got you babygirl.
3.  Oedipus or Mumma ka sher: door se Bohut hard. MC Sher ko bhi kha jayenge. Bhagwan Kaun? Apun hi Bhagwan hai. BUT MUMMA KI PHONE AAYI TOH PHATA HUA BALLOON KA TARAH SAB HAWA GAAND SE NIKAL JATA HAI. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs not married to his mother. You think his Desire to be squeezved between your boobs is because he‚Äôs attracted to you but NO it‚Äôs actually because it reminds him of the times he‚Äôs been breastfed by his mummaaaaaa.
4. Men written by women: these are the boys/men who genuinely understand the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù. They don‚Äôt boast about the fact that they LET you pick the restaurant. They don‚Äôt tell their friends that they LET you wear the clothes you wear. They‚Äôre the men who help you with your with the pleats of your saree, enthusiastically take part in skin care routines with you, aren‚Äôt afraid of being vulnerable around you. They‚Äôre the kind who normalise being called a feminists, they use their privilege to call out locker room talk, they don‚Äôt tolerate that shit. They remember your favourite coffee order or pastry or kfc order and the likes. And boiiiiiiii can I tell you is that a turn on. Like respectfully Sir, you have permission to rearrange my biological being with junior. Thank you very very much. No, honestly it would be my HONOUR TO BE REARRANGED LIKE THAT.

And FINALLY the best for last.

5. ‚ú®Schr√∂dingers Chutiya‚ú® : they‚Äôre dangerous. Not the you need to get a restraining order dangerous. But the ‚Äúmake you fall for me and now you‚Äôre unconsciously rearranging your life around me but imma still not date you‚Äù dangerous. If there were a traffic signal, you‚Äôd see all the damn lights on. They love living in plausible deniability. It‚Äôs always 5 steps forward and then ten steps back. One minute you‚Äôre all consumed with their love and üå∂Ô∏è spicyüå∂Ô∏è talk, the next minute y‚Äôall are still talking but the love ain‚Äôt the same they get weird if you bring it up. And the thing is no matter how many times you tell yourself no more, they know EXACTLY how to wiggle their way back in. They don‚Äôt come to get their dick sucked or stroked. They‚Äôre here just for the way you fawning over them makes them feel. Who needs to buy a gaslighter or match box to put your stove on when these fuckers exist? And whenever you ask then for clarity, they‚Äôre always lost and can surprisingly never remember what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it that way babe‚Äù oh really?

"Advice needed Just looking for some guidance

Hi! 

I (25f) have been seeing a guy (28m) for about 3-4 months now. Neither of us were looking for anything series. We agreed friends with benefits. Welll‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve grown super close and things are going great. We do date things and have a really good time. 

He is in a sticky situation because he still lives with his ex(their lease ends this month). He stays over my house probably 6/7 days a week. I‚Äôm worried that he‚Äôs just staying with me right now because he‚Äôs in this situation. I‚Äôve mentioned how I‚Äôve developed some feelings for him and he admits he does like me and cares about me but he‚Äôs just always been in a relationship and they‚Äôve all ended terribly. 

He just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship right this second.‚Äù Which my ex also put me through hell so I understand and I can‚Äôt imagine still living with them. 

Idk I just don‚Äôt want to waste time. I see posts like ‚Äúif he wants to he will‚Äù but after being through some traumatic shit I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy. 

The other night he was drunk (which I know üôÑ) and he called me and talked to me for 2hrs about how he wants me to be his girlfriend and how he wants me to meet his family but he just doesn‚Äôt know if he can handle another split from everything again.

She‚Äôs pretty new only been work there a few weeks and I thought she was pretty cute things is she‚Äôs kinda young 18 to be exact snd I‚Äôm 24. I personally don‚Äôt see that to be a big deal and truth be told not sure if that‚Äôs the main source of the issue but that‚Äôs my best guess as to why things are the way they are en.

I know sounds crazy but it got Intesne i never connected like that and he said that same....i felt like he was a mirror version of me. We talked about everything deep and dark and fun things to plans for the future and he keep saying he wanted to marry me I was perfect. I guesse I didnt kmow him so well but I would say our connection was equalvlant to one month of dating just to put things in perspective. Which is still know is not crazy serious but I think I started to fall for him not in love but started.

I've got over it alot but bits of me still miss him I need to fully let it go I need advice plz. 

So its kinda a crazy siatiatuon I just ended my previous situationship 2 days prior after being sexual assaulted and abused......i said I'd never have unprotected sex unless married but he did it while i was not sober. I was then dealing with fear of pregnancy and stds idk why i went back to tinder to distract my mind I guesse but we connected so intensely after a week I had to tell him it wasnt the right time I have to get tested for anything after being assaulted by this person I've only known a month so not that well.

"How to get over a past f-up? \*Throwaway account

I recently reached 30 (male, btw), and up until now I have never been in a serious relationship. There were a few casual dates here and there, but nothing too serious. I also was really focused on my studies (10 years to get an undergrad, but that's a story for another time), and dating always has been an afterthought for me. Also, no ""this is the one"" moment for any of the women I've met.

On top of all that, I had a big f-up that no one knows about; I got scammed into masturbating in front of a camera in front of a girl I met online, then whoever was behind the camera began to blackmail me. Thankfully I mamaged to bring everything under control within a few hours, without no one really seeing my dick pick.

I feel so ashamed, humiliated, and angry over what has happened. It has also definitely made me less trustful of others. As in, I can't trust anyone to open myself up, as well as not trusting myself to being honest to what has happened to anyone unfortunate enough to date me.

So as the title says, how do I get over a past f-up, and learn to trust myself and others? There's this girl (29f) that I've met at volunteering and I find her to be an amazing person, and I am crushing on her pretty hard. I of course try not to be too obvious or look like a creep about it.

I feel I can get the courage to ask her out (remember, no serious relationship before so I am sloppy at this), but my past fuck-up seems to be holding me back",MiddlePop,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e590a/how_to_get_over_a_past_fup/,1690775205.0,1.0
"Obsessives thoughts and intense negative feelings after one date, am I okay? Hello, I (28M) am writing this because of a dating situation I just went through and would like some advice/feedback in order to alleviate the feelings of worthlessness I often experience after I am rejected.

A few months ago I moved across the county to a city where I know nobody. It's a great career move for me but I need to start my social life from scratch. I've talked to some people in my apartment complex and made some friends. One of them invited me to a kickball league and I met a girl on the team. She DM'd me via GroupMe a few days ago, clearing indicating interest. I asked her out the next time we had a kickball game and we set up a date for the following day.

The date was great, I had a great time and I am confident she did too. We ended up having sex at my place, which in hindsight is where I think I made a mistake. Due to insecurities in the past I do not have a lot of sexual experience. I had a girlfriend for about 6 months in college, where we had sex frequently. I also did some casual dating about a year ago and only had sex once during that time. Outside of those two situations I haven't been having sex. Since I am relatively inexperienced I think I may have fell short of her expectations.

I tried to set up a mini golf date for this evening, and she gave me a maybe, recently followed by ""I don't think I've got it in me tonight"" and no attempt to reschedule which I read to mean she has no interest in going on another date. Her best friend is on the team so I may ask her if I should just assume we'll be friends from her on out, but I am for sure getting the vibe that she doesn't want to see me again. 

Ever since our first date (Tuesday) I have been thinking about her nonstop, obsessing over whether or not she wants to see me again. When she finally gave me the bad news I felt like I didn't want to live anymore. I am just crushed. A big part of the reason I am so inexperienced in dating and sex is because of the intense feelings this sort of rejection would induce in the past. 

I know it's perfectly normal to be upset in this situation, but I would really, really like to stop the obsessive, intrusive thoughts. I don't think its normal. It's only been one date and I can hardly focus at work. I go to bed and wake up thinking about her. She's on my mind when I am working out, watching TV, and playing video games with my friends. I feel like a desperate loser for putting this much attention and emotional energy into a person that I barely know. We get along and had one good date and we had sex once. That's it.

I have a great career, I am fit, and I am successfully developing a social life in a cool city where I don't know anyone. On paper, these things seem like a great successes and I should be proud of myself. On the inside I continue to feel desperate and unlovable. I can't seem to help but allow women to dictate my self-worth and command my attention. I tell myself that I shouldn't let somebody I hardly know control my self esteem, but my brain continues to obsess and I don't know how to make it stop.

Is this a common experience or am I mentally ill? Does anyone have any advice for me? Am I a complete moron for sleeping with her on the first date? I probably should have focused on developing an emotional connection first given that it's unlikely I'll be able to blow her mind in the bedroom without more experience. Is it always a bad idea to have sex on date #1 if you think you want a deeper connection?

Any advice is appreciated. I am happy to provide more information if it would help. Thanks for reading.

"Trying to see where things go again for the 4th time in almost 2 years (20M,21F) Before I get into the meat And potatoes of this connection, let me give some context. For one, he is in the military, the army, to be exact. We started talkin briefly after I had to put my dog down. When we met, he was separating from his now ex-wife. There is a child involved. 

We met during the week of December 2021, going into New Year's 2022. We were both young 19-year-olds. I had my apartment and car at the time, and he was a young careless private. We did meet on Tinder, of all places, and instantly clicked over text. Not too long after, we FaceTimed, and oddly enough, I thought we would stay friends cause we clicked so well. Soon enough, I drove 40 minutes to the base to meet him for the first time. I was anticipating just hanging out and wasn‚Äôt nervous at all. Then his 5‚Äô11 buff built self came in.  We locked eyes, and my entire body was stunned. He felt familiar. There was a spark, for sure.
I let him be my passenger prince and play music. We pulled up to my place and ate the pizza, he put on one piece, and we were lying watching the movie. One thing led to another, and we were two young 19-year-olds fuckin like bunnies. From there, a very intense, lust-fueled, and passionate relationship blossomed. The conversations were in-depth, diverse, and intriguing. The sex was great. Overall was a great addition to my life and company. I‚Äôd like to have around for a while. Keep in mind while this was all happening, he was divorcing his wife. He also wasn‚Äôt able to see his at the time one-year-old daughter. I would ask here and there how he felt about it, but he never liked talking about it too much. I didn‚Äôt want to prick and pry, so I left it alone. By the end of the month, his divorce was about to be finalized. Based on how we discussed things, I thought we were building something for it to be official in 5-6 months. Boy, was my little mind wrong lmao. He slowly started to pull away. I began chasing.
By my birthday, I ended up cussing him out over text and blocking him cause he couldn‚Äôt reach out and say anything. I was crazy and called him from a burner number, and he instantly answered. I know that is mature of me‚Ä¶ I left it alone. I was heartbroken because I felt like he had ghosted me on my birthday. I was fine for a few months, and then I reached out again in April of ‚Äò22. He apologized for doing what he did and said he didn‚Äôt do the arguing, so he just pulled away. Plus, his divorce was a lot on him.  I was understanding. I was going to let him come over again, but he ended up flaking again. I ofc got mad and blocked him because he buttered me up, got NSFW vids, and dipped. I stopped fw with him for damn near the rest of the year, but after him creeping into my mind again, I reached out in December of ‚Äò22. By this time, my car was long totaled (not my fault), and I moved back in with my family as I couldn't afford to live alone. This time his depression was apparent. He said he felt numb daily, but I made him feel something. He was sorry for everything he did to me, but he wasn‚Äôt in the space to give me what I wanted, but in the future, he did. He said he missed me and that I didn‚Äôt deserve all that he did to me. We had sex in his car that night, and then he was off to Korea. While he was in Korea, I tried to be friends with him, but we simply had dry conversations, besides when I told him a guy had violated me. Now this has all culminated to the present day. I hit him up last night. We had such different energy this time around.
We discussed the past, and I apologized for every time I spazzed out. He didn‚Äôt deserve it. Every time he stopped talking was because he was overwhelmed, depressed, working, or I cussed him out. He picked me up, hugged and kissed me, and opened my door. Then we drove off. We caught each other up about what‚Äôs been happening since we last spoke; I listened to his stories in Korea; I told him how I went to the club with a girl who ended up trying to fight me and how I‚Äôm taking summer classes. We laughed and overall had a great time. This was the first time we hung out without having sex. I asked him straight up if he wanted to go with the flow. He said yes, and we agreed to take baby steps. He dropped me off, kissed me a bunch while hugging me, and drove off. Should I take this chance? I saw our growth, but I don‚Äôt want the same story ending. I‚Äôm 4 months celibate, and been really focusing on myself. I‚Äôm open to having him in my life again cause we can go to the gym together, get money together, and see if we can build something. At the same time he has a avoidant attachment style while I have anxious attachment style. I wanted to add his child lives in a different state with her mother and her boyfriend. He and her were in a bitter custody battle, and he did lose. He was homelessness a couple of weeks, and has only semi-recently stabilized himself. He tries to see his baby as much as possible, but because he can literally be deployed at random it‚Äôs hard to coordinate anything in person, so he FaceTimes and calls her.",throwawaybby02120825,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e51u8/trying_to_see_where_things_go_again_for_the_4th/,1690774550.0,1.0

"Should I tell my new GF that one of my friends is my ex? I dated a girl when we were pretty young  13-14 for about a year. In it the relationship was a lot things, very few of them good. But in the end it ended in a rather amicable fashion.

We cut ties for a while, probably 2 years or so maybe less before we ended up speaking again over Discord.

That was back in 2020 and now in 2023 we're rather close friends, I ended up joining her friend group who, for the most part are unaware we dated. She found a boyfriend for herself dometime during our cut connectio  who I'm also friends with (and is aware of our past) through the group. And honestly calling it ""her"" friend group feels weird I'm just a member of the group now they're my friend group too. At the news I had found someone she was really excited to meet them because, well I'm advancing in my life and that's something we both celebrate for one another.

Anyway all this to say we're pretty close. But there's absolutely 0 spark remaining between our different partners. We both want whats best for eachother, support eachothers goals and dreams, share memes and laughs and jokes and reminicse about our childhood, entirely ignoring the fact we dated throughout it. It is merely a mutual, close, friendship.

Which is where my new girlfriend comes in. In a friendship where our past is still obscure to a lot of our friends because its ancient, dead and buried history, is it worth all the drama to even call her my ex over, childhood friend when introducing her? 

I want what's best for my new gfs emotional wellbeing and this is, unfortunately something I'm not always good at reading. The idea of betrayal if someone offhandedly mentioned we dated does make me worry about lying, especially because its not exactly a white lie, but I hear its a big red flag to be friends with your ex but I'm kinda in too deep to stop it now. Not without causing a big rift across my friends. Plus I don't want to stop being friends!

I had a feeling that we don't have the same long term goals or plans but kinda got pressured into asking her out ( I did/do like her). The date went well but it confirmed my fears.

Since the date, F and I still flirt regularly but nothing has happened. She has drunk text me a bit.

Last week she drunk sent me a selfie with her best friend P and I said you guys look hot

P messaged the next day and we started chatting. It was harmless to me because I thought she had a boyfriend and I'm literally flirting with her best friend. However the messages got really flirty and she eventually said when are you taking me out on a date? 

I even said something like I guess we will have to keep this quiet and she said why? 

I dont really see much happening with F and want to kinda see P but feel awful and also dont want to hurt F.

Do I just play along for now? do I speak to P and ask if shes told F or do I just pull out altogether?

"Why do every girl ghost me as soon as I try to talk to them 21m college student‚Ä¶.I work at a movie theater that gets a lot of foot traffic and a lot of pretty women, I am a very confident man and been told that I am handsome enough to model on several occasions by strangers. If you told me to go talk to anybody about anything men or female I could do it and not make it awkward. I don‚Äôt talk to every girl I be very picky.Ok so now that‚Äôs out the way I seen the very pretty girl walking to her theater with her friend. They were in a rush but I still told her that she was very pretty, name, and told them that it‚Äôs rare that I do this. I asked for her instagram to stay in contact she seemed hesitant so I made it super clear to not make it awkward saying that I don‚Äôt mind if you say no i won‚Äôt take offense at all. But she said yes so she put it in my phone I followed, she followed the next day but when I send her messages she won‚Äôt respond at all yet she would watch my story and such.

"[30M] When life is a hall of mirrors... The last few years have been difficult for me as my disease has progressed to the beginning of the end stage. It's come with a long list of realizations, compromises, and acceptances. I've always had to overcome adversity my whole life, but I always could adapt, rebound, and succeed. This time the damage and loss is permanent, there's no going back, and going forward means losing the rest of what's left of myself and who I am piece by piece, day by day, and I've already lost too much. It's warped and destroyed my life and completely turned my world inside-out. What's more, it has overtly changed the way people react to and treat me. Especially when it comes to making friends, and double especially dating. And by that I mean they just avoid me, altogether. It's made this period of my life extremely difficult and solitary.

I've spent the last several years completely alone. No friends, no romance, minimal interaction with the outside world. Not by choice, and not for lack of trying. And the truth is it's killing me faster, especially when people lead me on instead of just having the guts to say ""no"". Which would hurt a hell of a lot less than blown expectations. But when you're looking down the barrel of life, with Death patiently waiting for you in the cylinder, it really makes you realize what's important. I have so much left I need to do, and I don't want to finish this life alone.

I don't want sympathy. I just want someone to treat me like a normal person again. I want the same chances you'd give anyone else. I want to be looked at like a human being when I'm in public instead of with sympathy or repulsion. I'm a person, too, regardless of any medical issues I may have. I know I deserve the same shots at friendship and/or love as everyone else and, though I don't say it, it literally sickens me that I have to practically beg people just to interact with me for 30 damn seconds. I can't imagine what it'd take me to get a phone number.

Blemishes aside, I am an amazing and loving person who has lived a beautiful and full yet tragic almost 31 years. There is so much more to me than the conclusions people draw with one glance. It breaks my heart that people can't see past the tragedy and take a chance on me for everything else I am inside rather than everything I am at face value.

Hopefully there's still someone out there that can see past the rust and grime, with the patience to get to know me for the person I am. If that's you then send me a message. I would genuinely love to talk to you, especially if you're in the PHX area. 

Thanks for the read. Best wishes.",domiluci,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ds963/30m_when_life_is_a_hall_of_mirrors/,1690740826.0,1.0

"My fifth date‚Äî‚Äîabout my dating experience on a herpes dating site Navigating the dating scene as someone living with herpes can be complex, but a herpes dating site has made things considerably simpler. This is the account of my fifth encounter on this platform, a one-night stand with a woman, shared in a mild and straightforward manner.

This woman, let‚Äôs call her Jane for the ease of this narrative, had an online presence that resonated with me. Harboring a common ground owing to our shared experiences, we started conversing and developed a reasonable rapport. Eventually, we agreed on meeting in person at a nearby bakery.

Our real-life interaction was no different from our online conversations: comfortable and engaging. Jane was equally charismatic in person, and our conversations flowed naturally. We spent the day discussing our interests, sharing anecdotes, and gradually feeling more comfortable with each other.

As it grew late, Jane invited me over to her place. Maintaining mutual respect and understanding for our situation, we mutually decided to extend the boundaries of our relationship. We both knew the precautions and boundaries required due to our condition. Consent was a crucial part of our interaction, and we did not disregard it at any point.

Our one-night stand was gentle and respectful, nothing more than an extension of our connection. We both respected each other‚Äôs spaces and understood our circumstances, making our intimate interaction less daunting and more approachable.

With the break of dawn, we parted our ways, cherishing the pleasant memories of connection and understanding we had made.",N111ko_for_dating,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e2q1d/my_fifth_dateabout_my_dating_experience_on_a/,1690767469.0,0.5

"How should I approach this situation? So one of my batchmates from college just moved in near my house and we matched on Bumble. We never really talked while in college but I did have a crunsh on her at the time. But right now she didn't make the move in 24hrs and the match expired. Talk about timing being everything.

But as we were in the same college her profile on instagram was easy to find. Should i make the first move instead ?

Adding to the intrigue, there's a lurking suspicion about her profile's authenticity. Catfish tales are all too common in the online dating scene. I was thinking maybe I could use something I saw in this video , you know send her a DM saying ""we should take it of Bumble.""

I am afraid of the possible gossips in the back If I make a move considering we have a lot of common acquaintances ,but strangely, no common friend to pave the wayWhat if she's just as hesitant as I am?

But amidst all the excitement, there's a tiny catch - I'm not exactly a master conversationalist. It's nerve-wracking to think that after all this buildup, I might fumble on the conversation itself. But if I'm taking the plunge, I need a brilliant icebreaker to set the stage for a chat.

"8 Red Flags to notice and consider when dating someone seriously. This is based on a recent experience I had (31 y old male) while dating an older woman. These are 8 things to watch out for because they could prevent long term longevity.

1) Controlling 

Seeks to rule with a presiding authority over how your time is spent, and who you are allowed to associate with. Devalues your social circle in attempt to create codependency based isolation. Wants to shape your life into a submissive role that supports their own world, and their own goals while marginalizing your personal ones. Wants your behavior to be reflective of what they say is or isn‚Äôt acceptable, any violation of which could result in consequential punishment. 


2) Manipulative 

Utilizes coercive tactics to enforce their desired end results, including punishment/reward mechanisms. Instead of compassion and respect being given freely out of love, any attention or admiration must strictly be earned through adherence to the rules they set. Time of your own is largely nonexistent. You have to always be available when they need you for something or when they feel ‚Äòlonely‚Äô.


3) Overly Critical and judgmental 

The past is never the past, and instead of seeing the best in your potential, they will frequently bring up your previous mistakes to devalue you, criticize you, or make you have feelings of shame and regret. You apologize more than once for problems that you are wanting to move on from. They can‚Äôt let go of their resentment towards you. You may even be extremely accepting of things they did wrong while they are the complete opposite towards you.


4) Avoids admitting fault or accepting blame 

They avoid accountability 90% of the time. Sometimes they deflect from their actions by blaming you. Also known as blame shifting. You stop bringing up things you disagree with because you know it will likely never be resolved. You are never allowed to win an argument and they rarely if ever apologize for any of their own behaviors.


5) Lack of empathy 

When you are experiencing a difficult time in your life, they have no empathy for you. They accuse you of playing the victim. Instead of expressing care and concern, they tell you that you are weak or they make comments to disregard your thoughts and feelings. They don‚Äôt want to understand what you‚Äôre going through. You‚Äôre supposed to be happy and joyful in all circumstances. Their version of ‚Äúcheering you up‚Äù is typically unsupportive and mediocre.


6) Lack of intimacy 

They don‚Äôt show you affection often, and will stop you from initiating most physical interactions. You have to earn their affection and only on days when they aren‚Äôt too tired will they kiss you, or touch you. Leaving you feeling undesirable, or that this person doesn‚Äôt actually like you as a person. If there is an imbalance in this dynamic, it will lead to other problems in the relationship.


7) Temperamental 

Easily loses their temper at the slightest turn of events. Reactive to outside pressure with intensity that may result in being yelled at, or punished and berated. If they don‚Äôt get their way, someone has got to pay. Vengeful and cunning. 

8) Lazy, unmotivated 

They only have the energy to perform tasks that serve them and very little if any time to entertain your own ideas of a good time or how a day should be spent. They prefer to be lazy when it comes to things that you want to do. Your schedule revolves around their plans. You get used to not having any free time.


If you have any additional ones, let me know below. If you‚Äôre successfully or not in a relationship that has any of these dynamics I‚Äôd be curious to hear about your experiences.",zwolfe13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e125k/8_red_flags_to_notice_and_consider_when_dating/,1690762741.0,0.5

"Situationship or Healthy Development ? There's this weird space I haven't seen many talk about. 

When youve been love bombed by every man in your life because you've picked unhealthy partners- healthy, slow relationship development feels unsure and makes me anxious.

I've been seeing a man for about 2 months. We typically meet up once a week. We are having incredible sex at this point and exclusive without a title.

We both discussed upfront that we are slow to attach and had limited free time but he said he would put in the effort to see where this goes and I agreed to the same. 

The problem is that when we are together- typically on his days off we have an incredible time. It really feels great. I've noticed things slowly developing into something more. But, the in between we barely talk. If I text him he does NOW respond quickly (he didn't a few weeks ago) and  our conversations have sustenance. He works nights and so usually when he's awake, I'm asleep and that also complicates things. He said I can text him whenever I want but that he doesn't like the dynamics of texting and would rather get to know someone in person. He is also not active on social media. 

How do you know what is actually a situationship vs a healthy developing relationship? I understand that we complicated things with sex. I promised myself after my divorce if I felt sexually attracted to someone I would act on it. 

Unfortunately now I'm here, wondering what the heck we are. 

Any advice? Is this where I make a decision or discuss it? We HAVE discussed these things in a casual way.

"How long before trying again after a short relationship ends? My (29F) boyfriend (29M) of a few months broke up with me last week. It felt very much out of the blue. Basically he came back from a family trip saying that he didn't feel a spark anymore and that we were good but not ""great.""

I cried for a few days and now I'm just really frustrated by the abruptness and lack of communication. I feel like I don't miss him anymore just the idea of what we could have had.

I kinda just want to jump right back into dating apps to see what is out there. As a woman who really wants to have marriage and kids in my future, I feel like I do not have time on my side. But I'm also nervous to jump right back into apps because I am afraid to meet someone amazing and then realize I'm actually not ready and screw it up.

What if I get her pregnant?

Everyone else has great sex straight away so you need to perform as well. And if you can‚Äôt then she will leave for someone who can

What if I get really attached to her by having great sex and she leaves?

What if she clearly isn‚Äôt enjoying herself? (I do like to get her off in other ways though so I do those things)

What if putting a condom on kills the mood?

I don‚Äôt feel completely comfortable and trusting in her when it comes to sex because I don‚Äôt know her well enough yet

"Online Dating as a Hyperfixation I've had many, many issues with not sounding desparate while dating online. Or at least, that's how people characterize it. And I've never understood that sentiment. Yes, I want my person. I want to stop looking. I don't *want* to project confidence at someone, I want to feel *safe* with them (I've posted about this before). I want someone to inhabit a home with me, by choice, for the rest of my life. This is my ideal state. I thought that's what most people wanted. Why be coy?

I've always characterized this need as an imperative. But this is a terrible way of explaining things, so I've been thinking of other ways to express how I feel. And last night I found the word for it: hyperfixation.

To anyone unfamiliar with the term, do you know what a mosquito bite feels like? It itches incessantly. You *need* to scratch it. And it's a little fun to do, at first, because you get that endorphin rush of quelling the itch. But then it gets bothersome. The bite gets bigger, and sore, and they often come in waves. And even when it's over, just when you're ready to do something else? You go outside, or a mosquito gets in your house, and it bites you again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have several hyperfixations, almost all of which are stupid. Some are active, while others are passive. I actively hyperfixate on things like, for example, Sonic the Hedgehog (and now you understand why I'm still a virgin). The Sonic franchise is *big*. Lots of games, cartoons, comics, etc., many of which are not in continuity with one another. And I get it in my head to gather art, or design pixel art, to visually express a headcanon. And in theory this is fine. Except that the headcanon never really works. Too many pieces don't fit together. Redundancies exist between continuities. Some characters would, hypothetically, be off-limits in a story due to copyright reasons, and for reasons I could never explain to a rational human being it impacts which characters I use. So I spend hours to days on the Sonic Wiki gathering more and more data, all of which amounts to nothing when I get swept up in my next hyperfixation. It stimulates my mind, but it also burns me out.

A passive hyperfixation often gets paired with an active hyperfixation. Like, for example, rewatching old episodes of Atop the Fourth Wall. These days I hardly pay attention to the episodes, instead letting them play as background radiation. It feels like something between white noise and having company in the room with me.

Here's where this loops back around to online dating: I love stimulating conversation. It's my favorite part of any relationship. And I think that talking, as well as *planning* a relationship, is a form of hyperfixation for me. Because my instinct is to be the architect in any courtship. I feel like I need to be, since otherwise nothing will happen. And I get attached too quickly, without understanding what I want versus what the other person wants. Because I can't understand. I could *never* understand what anyone wants. All I do is fixate on a person, create a narrative in my head, and twist myself to fit that narrative. Or I burn out, and the whole thing falls apart. Actually it falls apart either way, since the approach I take online doesn't translate well *at all* to the real world. Turns out I like to talk, and most women I talk to want to be touched and told how pretty they are all the time. Which is fine, but isn't how I operate. Because that's not how my fixation works.

I think my end-goal is also a hyperfixation. I want someone to live with me. My perfect evening is for us to sit in the living room, maybe quietly, maybe while watching TV or reading, each doing our own thing. And that sounds cold, but to me it isn't. Because we resonate with one another. We are each other's white noise. Yeah, we'd still say pretty words, kiss, have sex, whatever, but those are bonuses. The goal is to just *be* together.

So when I hear people say I come off desperate, it's because I try to solve romantic needs the same way I solve my other needs. I get in over my head, overwork myself, obsess over minor details, and it *never turns off*. Unless I burn out, or the other person gets fed up. And I keep searching for the person who I can weave into my tapestry, because it's the only way I know how to function. I can't decouple this hyperfixation from the rest.

If at least one person reads this and understands, I'll feel as if I've achieved something. ",Wooden-Trip-8053,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dotvo/online_dating_as_a_hyperfixation/,1690732177.0,0.75
"Lack of Physical Attraction Pretty much what it says on the tin. I've been hanging out with this girl for roughly a month. We started talking earlier in the summer and dropped off for a while when I was taking care of some personal stuff. We've been on about 3ish dates now. Coffee date, movie date, and a concert, granted the concert was more that one of her friends fell out and she invited me to join her and the rest of her friends. I've enjoyed each date, and I've had a great time. We both laugh and seem to enjoy ourselves throughout. I do feel like I talk a bit too much, but even when I try and get her to talk a bit more it seems very difficult to get her to actually talk about herself. I'll be honest physically she's not my typical type, but she seems like a really genuine and kind person, and I guess I'm in a position of not wanting to cut things off before they have a chance, but I also don't want to string her along.

"How to put myself out there? Just as the title states. I'm 32 y/o male looking for some advice on how I can put myself out there and date women. I'm from a small town 2 hours north of Memphis, TN and 3 hours west from Nashville,TN. There not much to do out in the boonies and the dating pool is abysmal. Driving to Memphis and Nashville every weekend just isn't viable. I've been on these apps for 3 months and only had 1 match and 4 dates. I don't go to bars because I don't drink. I have my own house, have a 80k a year job, and do pretty well for my age.

I initiate conversation and when I  casually say hello,  they move away from me like I have the plague.

What makes it even worse, I really don't have any friends. I only got 5 friends. 3 of them live out of state, one is my housemate(but he's on the computer all day and night on theweekends), and the other one has his family to look after.

"Do people tell you why they're not interested? Do you ever get feedback from people you're seeing that hasn't developed into a relationship about why they don't want more? 

Not sure what it is I should work on lol. 

Every one has seemed more concerned with making sure they're polite and friendly and that they make me feel attractive and respected, but there's never an attempt at friendship (like hanging out or texting asking about my day or major life moments). And especially never an attempt at anything more. 

I once tried being direct with someone who shifted the relationship to just friends who hang out platonically, but we basically fought because he wouldn't say anything more than I have always thought of us as friends. But like I wanted to know what does that mean to him - do I invite him to parties, will he ignore me once his new girl finds out, will I be invited to the wedding lol

"Confused with my relationship with my friend?? So when I was 21 (F)  I had a massive crush on my guy friend and I asked him out. He rejected me saying that he was in university and wanted to focus on his studies.

I didn't take that personal and we stayed friends but I kept my distance, as I still had feelings for him. 

Fast forward to 5 years which is now. He finished university and immediately asked if we can have coffee to catch up as I hadn't seen him for a long time. During the coffee catch up,  the impression I got was that he was flirting with me, he was acting all nervous and blushing hard.

The problem is , I no longer find him sexually attractive like he isn't my type anymore.  Yes I had a crush 5 years ago but I guess I got used to seeing him as a ""friend"" . He is really sweet , and I'm not sure if im being unreasonable especially because my parents really like him too. 

Is my lack of attraction to him because he friendzoned me 5 years ago? Or is it something else?

"Guy and i are way too attached Tldr: Here's my dilemma. Guy and I are very close friends. We treat each other as confidantes and he said he trust me more than 100%. We live in different cities but the thing is I often go to his city because of a problem that I have..which lately is getting better because over time I'm healing although not totally healed.

Everytime I go to his city and is about to leave, he keeps asking when I'll come back or I'll be leaving for good and then proceeds to question his life and where he will retire. Once I said I'll be traveling to another country and he's like are you leaving me. 

When i left and told him i was in the airport, he got very emotional and told me he will miss me and he's praying for my safety. 

Then, finally he visited my city due to a common friend's event. He then asked me what my plans are and where would I really be whether I'll be in his city or in my city for good and he said I'm considering living in your city and I don't want that we might go in opposite directions. 

On top of this, we are extremely emotionally attached so my issue here is I'm not entirely sure of going to his city but he asked me again when I'll come back to his city, I did say I have plans of going few weeks from now. He proceeded to plan going somewhere with me. When we are apart, we totally miss the company. When we're together, we're the happiest.

It's just that it feels like we are so committed haha but I'm a bit pressured whether this is really going to be my plan because traveling is putting a dent to my finances. He also told me though that he is dating people. I'm not hurt but I just feel that there are strong emotions involved here both in my part and on his part and we don't act like these with people we are friends with.

So I'm totally stressed out with the level of committment this entails (having to see each other seems to be a need. He also told me he needs me because with me his guards are down)

I've had feelings for her off and on over the years and I know that she has as well. Probably less than me, but I'm also my own worst critic. Lately we've been talking much more than usual and it's been about things like what we want in life, what we find attractive in a partner, our goals for work/family/where we want to live, etc. I've always known we're similar (duh, that's why we're friends), but it's been eye-opening to have some of those more vulnerable conversations and realize how aligned we really are.  
  
For context, this is a distance situation. I see her several times per year since we have the same home-town. We could pretty easily increase that number, but we're about 5 hours away from each other. We'll both be home to see mutual friends next weekend and I'm taking her on a date. We've been out one-on-one many times before, but this is the first time it's been super intentionally called a date. We're going to a cinema club (mutual hobby) to see something lighthearted and will probably grab drinks afterward.  
  
I'm not nervous about what we'll talk about or if we'll have a good time; I know all of that will work out. What scares me is escalating beyond our friendship. I know I should tell her she looks beautiful, break the touch barrier, find a moment for a kiss, etc. I want those things too - she is beautiful and I'm excited for the chance to be intimate. I can't help but feel like I'm playing with fire though.  
  
Any advice on making those jumps from friends to more? Ladies who have dated or otherwise been intimate with someone they knew for many years prior, what did they start to do differently that changed your perspective on the relationship? Are there any boundaries you would place that are different from a first date with someone you've just met?

"Horrible skin I‚Äôm a 24M who has been single for almost 7 years now. When I was 20 I got this skin condition called seborrheic dermatitis. This resulted in big red spots on my face. The severity of it varies every single day but unfortunately it will never go away. In addition to this I‚Äôm really pale and get red very easily. 
The combination of the two results in my face being red almost every day.
This makes me very insecure because my face just looks ugly. 

With a clear skin I would probably rate myself a 6 but with this condition and everything I‚Äôm a 2.

I‚Äôve tried dating apps and meeting woman irl but I always end up backing down because I feel like they would rather date a man whose face isn‚Äôt red and I was too ashamed to ask them. 

My question basically is: is it a turn off that my face is red half the time and would anyone date someone who has this?

"So how much of a dealbreaker are older self harm scars from the past? So I have some scars that are pretty obvious on clothed parts of my body. My upper arm near my shoulder and on both thighs. So you can't see them normally, but someone I'd be intimate with would definitely notice them.

They're from 2021, during a period of extreme depression stemming from childhood trauma. But in the 2 years since, that has improved dramatically. Now I pass as a normal, well-adjusted person with some quirks. You wouldn't think I'd be at a point that low in my past. I still have minor depression, with the rare major depressive episode. But those are continually improving.

However, I feel like anyone who sees my scars will immediately be repulsed, and won't give me the benefit of the doubt that I'm better, and have greatly improved. They'll see it as a sign of a major personality flaw or psychiatric disorder that will always be with me.

This coupled with how I have no sexual and romantic experience makes me think I'm undateable (yeah, that's a real word...). How many people are going to put up with these seemingly significant red flags of mine? Probably a very small percentage.

"I always start to panic when things are starting to become more serious or feelings get involved I am (28F), never had a solid relationship besides a very confusing situationship for 1,5 years give or take and a 2,5 month thing in which we were exclusive (i eventually found out he was on tinder, so maybe not). I was very late to the dating game, so sometimes I feel like I am a newbie to this. Besides that I have had a hard time expressing feelings and letting people come close to me both physically and emotionally. However, I have been in therapy for about 8 years and I have changed so much. I am very happy with where I am now, but when it comes to dating a lot of my insecurities which i have worked hard on still kind of creep back in. 

I just met a guy during a holiday which i felt a connection with and he asked me out after. I mean I want to trust my gut that he likes me because he gives of those vibes. But in the past a lot of times I thought guys liked me and eventually just dropped me (hence the situationship). This makes me even more careful then before and i am sooo scared to like someone and get hurt again. But at the same time I just want to be able to open up my heart and let someone in. 

I started freaking out again, thinking I might have read his signals wrong and he doesn't see me that way at all. While when I am with him I feel like he likes me. But now being home and having time to think, I am freaking out again... I just wish I could just stay calm and see what happens. But part of me doesn't even want to try again and get heartbroken all over... 

I do think we have a good vibe, but now that we might become something more than just friends. It feels like I don't know how to act anymore. I feel like I have a hard time being myself and I am stressing out about doing something wrong... 

How do you just stay yourself and not let your head get in the way. I just want to experience whatever this is. Not overthink it to the point that I am so filled with fear that I freeze up or freak out. I talk to my therapist, I do mindfulness, I try to calm myself down in all the ways I have used over the past. But my mind still keeps racing too much in my opinion. It sucks!

"Am I too much of a red flag now? I've (M49) never had much luck with women. As a teenager and in my twenties, I was overweight, shy and distinctly average-looking amongst my peers and I kind of had the confidence to date sapped from me.
 In my thirties, I lost a little weight, socialized more (went to Uni) gained a sense of confidence but again, outside of a few drunken hook-ups, I was again that guy that seemingly wasn't anyone's particular cup of tea.
In my forties, my career has progressed well, I've got a good group of friends and enjoy life. I made a concerted effort to date in my early forties through various OLD platforms but nothing happened. During this, admittedly, I wasn't in the best shape but my now ageing average looks and my inability to make a connection and dating inexperience, was again hamstringing me.
Now I'm approaching my 50th next year and although I'm pretty much at peace with probably never having a family, it would be still nice to find someone to share my life with. I'm doubling down my efforts to improve my weight and fitness, but I feel my non-existent relationship past has made me a walking red flag with women. It would be interesting to hear from women around my age (and anyone else) whether my fears are well-founded and I should quit while I'm ahead or whether there's any hope for me. TIA

"39M Dating Profile Advice I am a 39-year old man looking to potentially start dating after my partner died 11 years ago. I am a tall (6'3""), fat (currently 300 lbs; am down 30 lbs and continuing to lose), bipolar (medicated), introverted, highly functioning autistic single father of a 16-year old trans girl. That is an enormous amount of baggage packed into one sentence, but I am also highly educated (masters degree), generally successful (6-figure salary, own my own home), and have been told I am friendly and caring, though I tend to overthink things.

With all of that being said, since I had met my partner at work many years ago by happenstance, I don't exactly know how to go about it. I figure Online Dating is a good place to start, which brings me to my real question:

If I am interested in dating, open to serious or casual relationships depending on the connection, how much baggage should I put in a profile? Height and weight are kind of no-brainers, as is my child (she is my first priority, but at 16 she doesn't really need a new mom) of course, but I am kind of torn on the rest. My bipolar disorder is under control with medication and I am very open when talking to people to let them know (when it might matter, coworkers, bosses, etc.) but there is the very real stigma surrounding it, and I don't want to blindside anyone. My autism could probably go without mentioning since I learned about it recently, but now that I know I also feel it would be wrong to not tell someone that might be interested in getting serious with me (maybe this would be a thing to leave out of a profile but bring up after a few dates?).

I guess I am looking for advice on balancing sufficient, honest disclosure vs. oversharing. ",Particular-Crab335,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dvvg1/39m_dating_profile_advice/,1690749706.0,1.0

"Having trouble maintaining my relationship Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year now. We loved each other but recently we‚Äôre having some problems at a tiring rate.

Things started to get difficult after I moved back with my mom after an unexpected chance of living together with my girlfriend for about 2 months, and my girl friend didn‚Äôt cope with my absence very well. She told me that she felt very down and cried a lot because she missed me. I comforted her that I missed her too and now it‚Äôs just a phase before we can officially live together.
After the first week she came up with the idea of getting a dog, I think that getting a dog might make her feel less lonely so I agree with her and we did went to get the dog together.

The first week after getting the dog, things does not seem to turn out well. She told me that this is a mistake and she couldn‚Äôt take care of the dog like she thought she can. I said to her that it‚Äôs normal for people to have cold feet after taking in a pet and I myself did feel the same way when I got my dog. And that she should take a try for the first month and if things does not get better we will find another foster home for the dog. Another week went by and everything seem to be brighter. She started getting used to taking care of the dog and she does not feel too down like when I moved out.

But then, the dog had scab. The scab has been before we took her in. My girl friend had spent a lot of money treating the dog condition. Now to think I was so stupid not telling her to contact the people that sold the dog to us, because we did contact them and they said they will cover the expense for us but we‚Äôve already paid for another facility. Currently the treatment does seem to work but too slow. Back when things got better, we had plan on taking some time for ourselves, but with the treatment got longer than expected, i‚Äôve told her she and I should wait in case of the larger expense. We had a fight, she said to me that she felt helpless that she cannot afford to do anything on her own without thinking to much like before she got the dog. I said that it‚Äôs normal that it does take a lot of money when someone first take care of a pet, not too mention that it is sick. She replied that she did understand but she just couldn‚Äôt wrap her head around the fact that now she cannot treat herself like before. Eventually she partly accepted the situation.

For my part, now with this continuous chain of poor choice, unlucky events and my many attempts to cheer her up just for things to drag her down even further depressed, I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do next because it broke my heart to see her like this and I don‚Äôt seem to help her feel better at all. And it also affected my life as I‚Äôm writing this at 3 in the morning because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my relationship. I would be really appreciated if you guys could help me with some advice.

There was this one time where she said she wanted to skip dinner. I said it's alright but on the 3rd time she said sorry I said ""promise it's okay. Who am I to complain (laughing emoji).

All these bad things happened in 1 day. Maybe she got turned off by taking candid picture of her or I wasn't confident in my answers or she didn't like how I think. Or maybe it was my outfit she didn't like. All I know is all this thing I am saying happened in the last date. I should have been more mindful.

The boy Jack originally described was completely different, replaced by a ramshackle cabin. I started to feel flustered, but I went in resolutely. I found the room disorganized, with wine bottles everywhere and broken furniture. A dirty man appeared in front of me, he was not the gentle and caring Jack I expected.  
  
He smiled and said in broken language, ""Are you here to drive me away?"" I was uneasy, but still trying to understand the story in front of this man.  
  
He begins to tell about his past, a time when he was a wealthy businessman whose fortune gradually disappeared due to a series of unfortunate events. To a certain extent, he pinned his hopes on online fraud and was forced by life, but he also regretted what he had done. I immediately understood that this man was the Jack I knew. Although he was far from the image I expected, I still felt pity for him in my heart.  
  
Jack and I had a long chat that rainy afternoon. He honestly apologized to me, admitting that his false actions were motivated by feelings of desperation and deprivation. I can feel the deep remorse and self-blame in his heart.  
  
Even though Jack was more broken than he was before, I knew we had formed a special bond. I decided to forgive him and reach out to him when he needed help. I want him to find himself again, to rerealize his lost value from within.  
  
I worked with Jack through a long rebuilding phase, as he underwent career training, sought counseling, and worked to move beyond his past. We develop a whole new level of trust and understanding, sometimes even deeper than before.  
  
Virtual worlds are not always real, but real emotion can be found in these illusions too. Sometimes, people act falsely not only out of selfishness, but also out of inner emptiness and desperation. We should learn to be tolerant and understanding, so as to support others sincerely.  
  
It is not impossible for virtual love to become real, it just needs more tests and persistence. Of course, it does happen that you only meet after chatting online for half a year and find out that the other party is a liar, so it is also very important to be vigilant in online dating.

"We just had our 3rd date and I still feel confused as to whether she even likes me-- what do I do? I (F25) have been dating a woman (F25) for 3 weeks. We've been out with each other once each week. Our actual dates are pretty fun and I like her. The problem is that I'm not sure if she feels the same way at all. 

The main reasons are as follows: 

1. Her texting response times are glacial. Always within the day, but many hours later. If it were up to me, we'd be chatting a lot more, and that's even with the fact that I normally hate texting. I want to talk to her, and get to know her. Part of me wonders: am I just getting too attached too quickly, maybe these response times are normal? 

2.  I've been driving everything. I've planned and paid for all of our dates, which I'm delighted to do-- but combined with the first point, it overall feels like she wouldn't even notice if I just dropped off the face of the planet. She showed a bit of initiative by asking if I wanted to go to a museum with her this weekend, but she had a change of plans and we didn't go. 

3. She's been a bit more physically distant than I would like-- like we haven't even kissed yet and I haven't bothered asking because I feel like she wouldn't be comfortable with it. I feel like you should only ask to kiss if you're really feeling that mutual ""energy"" in the air-- but I'm just not getting that from her. She said she wants to go slow, and I totally understand and even prefer it. ""Going slow"" is a green flag to me. But in light of the above two points, it just feels like I'm getting strung along a bit. To be clear, I would never pressure her or even ask her to do anything physical. I'm waiting on her and I'd be happy to wait as long as she likes. I'm just listing this as a point because I feel that I'm overall getting no positive indication from her that she's into me. 

It just confuses me that she still seems to enjoy our dates (and agrees to more), even though she seems to show minimal interest in me outside of them. It's made me dislike her, honestly. So as a result, I've come to the conclusion that I should cease planning any further dates and stop trying to text her. (Although, being the drunk idiot that I was on our last date on Friday, I invited her to take my second ticket to an expensive upcoming concert ü§¶). My thinking is that if she basically doesn't take any initiative whatsoever within the next week, I'll take that as a rejection and move on. She could:

1. Initiate a text conversation with me.

2. Ask me out on a date.

3. y'know üëâüëà 

And if she does any of the above, it might not really mean that it'll work out, but I'll at least not call it quits completely by next Sunday. But I don't know if this is the right course of action or what.

"[Loneliness] Being unmarried or single for whole life Hey Folks, I will be turning 30 next year. Currently single and not planning to fall in love / get married. 

I have been into 3 long relationships - spanning more than 3 years each of them. 

For most of the life aspects it is normal, I don't feel any issue being single. I have a pretty busy schedule - job, workout, sleep, hobbies once in a while. I don't find issue in making myself busy. I enjoy myself.

The only thing that causes an itch in my heart is the feeling of loneliness. I feel there are lots of things you can not share with friends or close family members. There is a sense of completeness you get from another human only, someone you know who is always there, someone you can call and chat for any long, someone who you can spend as much time as possible. Someone you know is for you and will stay yours for years and years.

"How do you know if someone is dating you for superficial reasons I broke up with my boyfriend because of some red flags at the time . I misinterpreted some things that he said , actually I don‚Äôt really know now and am having second thoughts. He seems to say things sometimes without thinking first . In my experience people usually tell you who they are if you listen enough however . One time he said ‚Äúmaybe women shouldn‚Äôt work because of their periods‚Äù and another time he said that ‚Äúsome people think that women shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to vote‚Äù. After talking to him about these things that he said and how they came off as extreme and misogynistic statements in 2023, he explained that he thinks that we still aren‚Äôt able to talk about how periods affect women and that women should be able to take time off work if their periods really affect them enough. He also clarified and said that there are some people who think that women should not have been given the right to vote because women are considered underprivileged still in our society they can be easily manipulated by political candidates even if the candidate isn‚Äôt a good candidate and isn‚Äôt going to help our country in general they will say they will help women‚Äôs rights and women will buy into it. He said that isn‚Äôt his belief that women shouldn‚Äôt have been given the right but that he understands where people who say this are coming from and doesn‚Äôt know what the answer is for women or minorities who are easily manipulated by these political candidates. So all of that makes sense and is a discussion that makes sense but the original statement he makes comes off as extreme right? 

I have given this guy the benefit of the doubt because I think we all can say extreme things and not exactly mean it. He told me I have said extreme things about men too or other topics and he doesn‚Äôt hold it against me. He cited that I at one point made a statement and said that I had said that a lot of men are sexual perforators . I think we were watching chris Hanson lol. I responded that might come off as extreme and can see how people would be put off by my statement but that statistics show that a lot of sexual assaults are under reported and even the statistics that are reported are high with 1 in 4 women being sexually assaulted in her life . In my own experience using dating apps and dating in general I have been sexually harassed or groped approximately 20 times in my life so I was also making this statement based on my experience. I don‚Äôt think that this statement comes off as hating all men or anything like that. I also don‚Äôt think it is comparable to his statements as I feel like in this time most men are a little more careful about saying such extreme statements since the difference is that women can fear men and men don‚Äôt experience that with women . I feel like he‚Äôs trying to flip the script to avoid accountability ?

Most recently after trying to be understanding of my boyfriends statements and getting back together he told me that he felt he needed to reach out to me again and get back together with me because I am the most beautiful woman he‚Äôs ever dated. I was really offended at this particular statement because all of my life I have experienced men lying about themselves, misrepresenting themselves , and lying about their intentions in order to date me because they think I‚Äôm attractive . I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want to be considered attractive but it is also a double edged sword in dating just like I‚Äôm sure rich guys have that double edged sword too. I said how this really offended me and my boyfriend apologized and said he says stupid things sometimes and how he obviously likes other things about me and then cited him stating these other things this way which can sound harsh . He does constantly compliment me on other things like my cooking skills, how we have amazing conversations, how he‚Äôs never met anyone like me that thinks the way I do and how we can talk about all kinds of topics , how I am really sweet, how I am health focused, and how smart I am . 

But this statement bothered me I guess because of my experiences of men lying and even making me think they really like me only to find out they like me primarily because they find me attractive and that is their main priority . I have so much more to offer than how I look and want someone who can appreciate those other things as much because someday I‚Äôm going to get old and wrinkly just like all of us , and there‚Äôs got to be more to a relationship than that . I would like to see it as a compliment I took the wrong way but idk. How do I know if my boyfriend just says dumb stupid shit sometimes ? How do I know that he really likes me for me primarily and not shallow stuff ? How do I know if he is trying to backtrack and cover up statements  he makes ?",Odd_Match2206,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15drq5a/how_do_you_know_if_someone_is_dating_you_for/,1690739498.0,1.0

"NBSB at 22 Hello everyone, I am F(22) about to graduate from Uni and start living my life as an adult soon. I won't say it's embarrassing but I don't have any experience in dating and never had been intimate with a guy because I focused solely on school. I didn't fancy putting a lot of effort to what I look like before and just lived off life as a student who works hard. However, these past three years I started paying attention to what I look like and invested greatly on myself. I'd say I love how it made me feel really because I think it made me confident and happy looking at myself in the mirror. It also made me feminine, which is another delight all in itself. I discovered I like being girly girly... wearing dresses, necklaces, and fancying make up too. I started getting a lot of compliments and admirers out of nowhere. I've never received them before in all honesty and it makes me warm hearing them. I'm not exactly lonely because I think I'm pretty established emotionally (being single all these years) but I wanted to enter the dating scene and try being with other people's company aside from myself now that I'm pretty fine with who I am. Now, I'm kind of traditional and don't want hook ups or any of the sort. I just want someone who's up for the long term and who wants to build a possible future with me. So this goes that I don't want someone who'll just play around. Now the real issue arises, am I likely to be taken advantage of because of my zero experience in dating?

Feedback on Approach - I feel shame for wanting sex early on. Hello everyone! My dilemma is that I used to date someone and be friendly and then usually wait till the 3rd date to push for sex. Then I started to realize that if sex isn‚Äôt communicated early on you could get stuck w women who want to wait till marriage. So now I am pretty straight forward with women and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs being received or if I am being creepy? Is it ok to just want sex? I feel kind of weird being that way. Also my texts are asking them to come over usually after the bar. I usually get ghosted. Need help.

"Am I doomed? So, probably a fairly common query on here but here goes...

Years ago when I think I was at university this girl followed me on Instagram. I didn't follow her back as didn't know her but she's always been active in viewing my stories etc, kinda odd. Out the blue after like 10 years she messaged me and we got chatting, just friendly really. She then mentioned she was moving away for work and asked if I wanted to continue or meet before she went? I politely declined and said it wasn't really what I was after... (She just wanted to have some fun I think)
She then suggests I speak to her friend who she showed my photo to and said she recognised me from a dating app years ago and that she liked how I looked. 

I got speaking to her, seems really nice but is a little guarded ( won't give out socials) due to bad post experiences so we are chatting on Skype messages lmao. 

She is legit, really pretty, smart and interesting. Kind of out of my league I feel. I think she is fairly experienced in dating so probably isn't nervous.

I on the other hand have been single most my life with only a few times really putting myself out there but only when something falls in my lap really, kinda like this situation. Without trying to be cocky, I'd say I'm decent, I'm 6'5, look ok, in ok shape, good professional job and good chat when around people I know, bit of a softie.. All my mates and their wives can't understand why I'm single and try to set me up so they think I'm a catch for their friends enough to recommend... but when it comes to dating I just get kinda nervous, as if I'm going to talk Infront a crowd of 1000 people. So I've made it all this way kinda not doing much and just avoiding feeling uncomfortable. But I'm fully aware this is holding me back in life and I want to change it.

I really like this girl but just feel that when we meet my nerves will get the better of me and it will overshadow who I am and what she's grown to like and she'll end up bolting. We are planning to meet soon.

"Should I confess to my long-distance friend of three years that I have feelings for him or just let it go? I really don't know what to do and I really need your honest advice. This is my first time writing here, never in my life I thought I would do this, but here I am. I've been reading stuff for a while and I enjoyed it. I am having second thoughts about confessing to my friend so I thought maybe I should ask for some advice. Backstory, we met online and we became good friends, you know we talked every week sometimes we call. Then I got into a relationship and surprisingly, we're still friends. My ex and I broke and it destroyed me so much and he was there. He's one of my support systems who helped me a lot during those times. I got back up again and now I'm happy with my life, still on that healing journey but I am better now. I denied to myself that I was having feelings for him for a lot of times because I thought maybe I just carried away because he's always there for me through ups and downs and maybe because he's giving me attention. As time passed by, my feelings were going deeper and now I'm sure. The thing is, he's in Europe and I am in Asia, we haven't met yet, but I know what I am feeling is real. I want to keep this friendship for this lifetime, that's how much I am grateful for our friendship. But now, I am afraid I might ruin it because of my feelings. üòî I don't know if I should keep it to myself forever because I feel like that's me lying to myself. 

He told me about his new co-worker and he told me he finds her pretty and nice. He said he doesn't like her nor have a crush on her. He's just curious about her and wants to know more. He wants to talk with her and see where it goes. It breaks my heart but I can't say anything. So, would it be selfish of me to confess to him now? I just want to confess so I won't hurt myself anymore because of regrets. I know there will be a possibility of him dating her, so maybe before that happens I will just try to confess so that I'll have peace of mind too. But, I am scared. I want to keep this friendship forever, but I am afraid that my feelings will ruin it. 

What should I do? I am desperately asking for help now. I am sorry, I hope you guys will have a nice day and thank you too!

It has only been a few hours since I posted but I thought I‚Äôd like to clarify a few things.

When I initially found out, I didn‚Äôt have the whole story, so I let him convince me that he had just made a one time mistake and took him back. 

A few weeks later when I caught him lying about being with another girl, I broke up with him again. After I had blocked him on literally every platform, including the dating apps when his profile would pop up, I thought he‚Äôd finally leave me alone. 

THEN I started talking to a guy on hinge and agreed to go on a date at a newer restaurant in town for dinner.

"New relationship, can I trust him or is he cheating on me? I've been dating a guy for about four months and we've fallen hard for each other. We spend a lot of time together and there is absolutely nothing that makes me question his feelings for me, besides this one thing. We're very intens and passionate together. We spoke about what we were and we agreed on having a monogamous relationship. I also met some of his friends recently. He's a very vain and extraverted man who needs a lot of validation from other people and I  myself have some issues with trusting men. Bad combo in that area I guess.

I never had doubts about his intentions, until I found out recently he was still active on a dating app. He didn't tell me, I found out. We talked about it as grown ups, because I didn't want to throw everything away that was good. Asked why he felt the need to use it and he needed the validation. He was curious. He deleted the app, no further issues about it. 

Only now I realize that my trust has gone to bare minimum. He's on a holiday with friends in the middle of nowhere. They go hiking. And well I had this bad gut feeling he was going to install the dating app again. Now I noticed he has way more followers on Instagram, only from 1 day abroad. He on the other hand doesn't follow back. I know it's not healthy to check these kind of things, but my gut feeling never failed me in the past. And well, he gave me a reason to distrust.

"I‚Äôm assuming I should give up? Hey guys. 
Since around 6 weeks ago, me and this girl I met on tinder really hit things off. We seemed to work really well with one another, like as if we knew each other for years beforehand. Nonetheless, the past week or two have been different. She started by seeming more blunt, and defensive over things - such as when I give her advice or something which she doesn‚Äôt want. I was fine with this. But since then, she has stated she wanted to take things slow due to her past relationships being difficult and even abusive, so she needed time to prepare and get herself ready for me. This too, I was fine with.

But. That was only the beginning. Since then, she became more and more blunt, slower and worse replies etc. and the second I question it, she gets super defensive and annoyed, and thus becomes overall worse with me. So, to cut a long story short, I‚Äôm now at a point where she isn‚Äôt able to meet for a month due to how ‚Äúbusy‚Äù she is, and she hasn‚Äôt even replies to any of my messages today.

"Who is more wrong in the my relationship or are we both morally grey and weirdly functional So my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 6 months, but she doesn‚Äôt seem interested in the relationship really, to the point where she keeps getting my name confused with ones that sound like it. She‚Äôs also been cheating on me, but I am not upset because I am just dating her to pacify my parents since she is very charming and they didn‚Äôt approve of my previous gf and were the reason we broke up, though we are also still seeing each other and technically cheating. I believe the only reason my gf is dating me is because her sister set us up on a blind date and she didn‚Äôt know that I was her sister's childhood bestfriend. When my gf got told that information, she kind of looked scared, I think because she also only went on the date to pacify her sister but couldn‚Äôt back out of dating me since my friend (her sister) is very overprotective of me and would‚Äôve gone crazy on her. I know this because I overheard her talking to her friends saying how she doesn‚Äôt count what she‚Äôs doing as cheating because she feels backed into a corner and never wanted a relationship in the first place since she doesn‚Äôt do commitment or feelings.

"No second dates Hi I am 34 F , recently divorced, I have been going on these first dates with many men in past few months but I never get a single text afterwards from these men and they just disappear from my life. If I text them asking how they are doing etc , they do give me reply a polite reply back and thats it . It never goes anywhere after that. 

I am starting to wonder that What I am doing wrong on these first dates that I am not getting a single second date. After analyzing everything ,i think they might be turned off by my reluctance to take things physically forward so quickly. I am Indian and all these guys are Indian too so they know already I would not be moving to physical stuff so quickly. 

Another thing might be that they were shorter than they claimed to be in their profiles. I am 5‚Äô8 and in their profiles they mentioned they were 5‚Äô10 and above but in reality they were even shorter than me. I honestly had no problem even though they were lying but they were visibly uncomfortable about my height saying they didn‚Äôt expect me to be this tall. Claiming I am lying about my height , that its 5‚Äô10 or 5‚Äô11 at least.

"Need advice to approach a girl at workplace Hey all, I'm fairly new here, but I hope I'll get good advice here.  
  
I'm a 25 yr old guy working at a MNC in India. So I've never really been much into dating and stuff, but since a couple of months or more maybe, there's this girl at my workplace that I seem to be infatuated with. We work in different departments and don't have any mutual friends, the only place I see her is in cafeteria and that too with her gang of friends. I have observed that we both make a lot of eye contact and then suddenly look away, and I somehow feel she maybe interested as well, although might be wrong. About me, I look decent, have good height and personality (at least that's what I think), and am confident enough to be able to talk to girls and guys alike. I'm a bit of in between the old-school and modern gen kind of authentic yet adaptive guy. I think she is my kind as well at least based on what I observe and seems mature like me as well, who's not looking for anything casual but something meaningful.  
  
Now I am confused if and when should I approach her because she is always with her gang of friends so I don't get a chance to approach 1-1 even if I'm confident to approach. Also I'm not sure if I'm in hurry and I should give it more time and whether or not she might like it given she seems a bit of shy person as compared to me. Also given it's not college and we're in office, I can't ruin my (or her) career just because I couldn't hold my horses.  
I'd appreciate if men and women in this forum could help me out on when and how should I get a chance to talk 1-1 with her and how fast/slow should I take the conversations. I'm fine if she rejects my proposals and won't care to bother her or spam her again if she rejects me, but want to give a shot anyway, since I've never had such strong feelings for a girl before.  
  
PS: I want to date her with an intention of marriage. I understand that not all dating or relationships end up in marriage and I'm fine if later we figure out it won't work for some reason (like my first college date from few years ago), but the intention is not just short-term but for long lasting meaningful relationship that would lead us to spending lives together.

Other than that, I like going to parks, coffee shops, and bookstores. I‚Äôm also going to start at the gym soon. So maybe that‚Äôll help too. 

I was also recommended by another Reddit user to try dating an introvert given my past and personality.

So I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice for how to approach men, start a conversation, flirt, and where I could possibly find success.

"i don't know how to start again Its been 7 months since my first break up and I'm really struggling. My first love felt like it would never end and i didn't phrase it like it but i essentially told my then partner that they'd probably be my first and last, which looking back on is immature i know but i now feel like ive trapped myself in this promise that i feel too guilty to break. I also told myself i'd wait for a reaallly long time before i started dating again because during the height of the heartbreak i just found so many things wrong in a relationship i used to find so amazing, so i decided i was too immature and should take a good long break. But, there's a new person who is so sweet and lovely and they make me wanna try again, i love spending time with them and i genuinely think I'm falling in love again. Again, this may be such an immature take but I've never understood why other people date again after such heartbreak and pain, why should I give me heart away again after the uncertainty of losing another person?  I love really hard and earnestly and being vunerable with someone just to lose them again honestly scares me. I honestly just think I'm torn between trying this whole ordeal again with someone who I'm really falling hard in love with, yet breaking all of the rules and promises i subconsciously hold myself accountable for or moving on and missing out on this person.

"No means No, Put on a condom means Put on a condom No means no, Put on a Condom Means Put on a Condom

Dated a dude for like 3 weeks. He was honestly so sweet and respectful so I was so caught off guard the last time we met.

We already started having sex just a couple days before, and I was clear I wanted to use condoms, which he said he was so happy about because he definitely wanted to use them too.

But after our first night having sex, I told him I've never had unprotected sex and I think it fucking blew a screw loose in his mind. Because the next time we were going to have sex he was about to enter me -- I tell him to please put a condom on. He says he will, he just wants to tease me a little more. Then he's about to try again, I tell him immediately again to put a condom on. He then just gets down on me and proceeds to try to start fucking me and coaxing me into it asking me to please let him because it will feel so good. I say no, speaking up for the 3rd time, and he finally gets off of me and puts a condom on. He was really staying turned on after moaning about  the fact that even though we wouldn't now how he could basically fantasize about us having unprotected sex in the future. I was confused by the end of the night and after he left it finally hit me what the fuck just happened.

I broke it off and just wanted to discuss what made him do that and let him know that was not okay, don't do that to anyone else. But just for the fact that he already knew I wasn't going to be with him anymore he didn't even give me the chance to express how his actions made me feel. It feels like someone just breaking my boundaries and then telling me I have to respect theirs by just shutting up so they don't have to deal with the pain they caused. His response as far as why he did it was to ask if it was such a big deal to lose the condom if we're both clean and I have an IUD. It's not that he couldn't have asked me, it's that you shouldn't ask me right as you're trying to force yourself on me, especially after me asking you to put a condom on twice,  AND already having discussed using condoms beforehand.

How can he talk like women's/reproductive rights are an area of interest to him and then do that shit to me. I've never had unprotected sex before, can you please let me choose when I have that experience instead of trying to steal that choice away from me?

Reported him on bumble and to the police.
I hope he never fucking does this shit again.

So disappointing that someone can come off like such a gem and then just disrespect your fucking heart and soul like that, just treating me like a fucking cavity to claim. Honesty, respect, empathy, is that so hard to give? I gave him more compassion even offering to just talk it over with him than that fucker even deserves with the way he responded to me. I will just never understand how people can be so callous and incongruent.",Upset_Bison8739,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dbkq4/no_means_no_put_on_a_condom_means_put_on_a_condom/,1690689494.0,0.78

"Is it unreasonable to expect your partner not to curse at you during an argument? 24F and 31M I've (24F) had a rocky online relationship with a man (31M) for a little over a month. Although it's been just a little over a month, it has felt super rocky with high highs and very low lows.  
  
  
  
I broke up with him today after he said ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you"" to me during an argument over something stupid. I also blocked him. He found another method to contact me and has stated that this was a misunderstanding and that I'm willing to throw away our relationship over one simple mistake.  
  
  
  
My thought is, can something like this really be labeled as a misunderstanding or a little slip up, as he seems to think it is? I've been in emotionally manipulative and abusive relationships before, and it feels like he's sorta belittling how dehumanizing it is to have your partner yell obscenities at you during an argument. It feels like he's minimizing the gravity of his actions as well as my feelings.  
  
  
  
Should I accept that this is just a slip up? Or is his behavior a red flag for things to worsen from here?  
  
  
  
I will say that the reason things have been so rocky is that he has been pressuring me for sex and emotionally whiplashing me over my need for patience. He himself has been emotionally volatile, lashing out at me and breaking up with me only to ask for me back after he calms down. He seems to think that all of his actions can be attributed to misunderstandings and slip ups, but I kinda don't think so. He seems to think I'm unreasonable for expecting to be treated better, that this is just normal for relationships.  
  
  
  
Am I being unreasonable? Is it normal to yell obscenities at a partner during an argument?  
  
  
  
TL;DR: Ex bf contacted me after I blocked him because he yelled at me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you"" during an argument. He says I'm being unreasonable and this was just a misunderstanding and a slip up, and it seems like I'm just throwing our relationship away over a mistake.

"How do I get through this? PLEASE HELP: Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M21) broke up. We were together for 4 months and I don‚Äôt think I have the strength to get through this. He‚Äôs Muslim and I reverted to Islam in March and then met him. I know this is haram, but please give me advice because I really need it. He asked me about my past and I told him half of it out of shame, I altered numbers but told him enough to know what I did and the sins I had committed. I lied because I was ashamed and hated my past, but I felt guilty and so I told him everything. I revealed everything over time, I could never find the courage to say it all at once. He kept digging at my past asking for every detail and whenever I remembered any I told him. He made it very clear how important it was to him and the more I revealed the more he shamed me for my past. Over the past few months he has blamed me for the failing of our relationship and treated me differently. I took accountability and have tried earning his trust back and out of guilt I‚Äôve eventually told him everything and he said he couldn‚Äôt forgive me. He has called me a horrible names, a liar, evil person, and made out as though I am the only one who has committed this lie. Two weeks ago I remembered something else from my past (I genuinely had forgotten and told him instantly because he has consistently asked me for the smallest of details regarding my past). He said he couldn‚Äôt forgive me, no matter how much I begged and pleaded. During our relationship he has wanted to leave me a number of times because of my past/lies. He told me a week later whilst we are on holiday that he had lied about how many people he had slept with (something which I hadn‚Äôt lied about I told him the truth about mine) and the amount really hurt me. He said he lied out of shame and guilt and then wanted to get back with me. I felt really hurt and as though he has enjoyed making me suffer for the past few months regarding my past. I feel he had been so unfair to me because he had treated me the way he has when all along he lied too and much worse. I was shocked, he felt no guilt at all no matter how many times I asked. In his defence he also asked me many times and I chose to reveal my past slowly bit by bit because I couldn‚Äôt take the judgment and shame it brought me. He forgave me everytime but I feel it was out of guilt because he was hiding so much more. I understand what I did was wrong, I thought I could conceal my past sins and only tell him enough to have a broad idea. I am hurt at how he used my past against me and I wouldn‚Äôt have done the same to him if I knew his past. I am hurt that he made me feel as though I am the only liar. I understand his reasons completely. Moving on, he begged for another chance (during the rest of our holiday) and I forgave him about a week later on the second day of returning. During that week I struggled to forgive him. He realised that how he treated me for the past 4 months for my lies despite lying himself, was narcissistic. The things that occurred and the way I was made to feel. It was narcissism and we both agreed on that. I felt he would always treat me with such unfairness. I understand why he lied, he felt ashamed and I love this man and so I dropped it. I‚Äôve been really ill whilst the majority of this happened, I‚Äôve had tonsillitis and otitis externa (ear infection) and on the day I got it (second last day of our holiday) he left me alone most the day. This was when I hadn‚Äôt given him the chance in his defence, we were broken up. He got me food when I asked and made me a cold flannel for my head, but left me alone 90% of the day and went out and had fun doing water activities. That same night he headed out at 11pm and I wanted to wait up for him. We were in a different country and I was worried for his safety. This same night he turned off his location and deleted all our pictures (he said it was because he felt hurt which I understand). I messaged him and he said he was safe and at a barber shop because he needed space (this was at 2am) because seeing me made him hurt as we were no longer together which again I understand. I couldn‚Äôt handle it, I went out to look for him as there were many barber shops nearby but couldn‚Äôt find him (he was at one deeper in town). I was in tears the whole time. I was begging him to reply to me and after an hour of texts he came home. I lost it and asked how he could put me through everything. I‚Äôve felt worried, untrusting of him, ill, and betrayed. I began cursing at him when he said he‚Äôs done nothing wrong (something which we didn‚Äôt do in our relationship). We had a big argument, horrible things were said from us both including me and the next day we headed home. He pleaded for a chance this day and I rejected it, I wanted him and love him but the pain felt too much. A day later I‚Äôve given him this chance and I‚Äôm still ill and he comes to see me to take care of me. As soon as I gave him the chance things were starting to go wrong. I felt a lot of the rules we had during the relationship were made out of control, something he acknowledged and agreed on. I scrapped our rule of getting home by a certain time (10:30pm) and said not to take the mick with it, I‚Äôm just removing it to make it a variable time to get home because things can be unexpected. We have never gone out late with our friends or came back at crazy times. I was happy with coming home by 10:30, but I felt the rule was out of control on his part and I wanted to shake that feeling. The next day he goes out with his friends and comes home at 2:30am. I wasn‚Äôt okay with this and explained to him how I said we weren‚Äôt going to take advantage with it and just once in a blue moon will come home after midnight. I also said I didn‚Äôt expect you to hop on it straight away as we have making up to do. The next day he messages me telling me he‚Äôs going out (it‚Äôs 10:30pm) and didn‚Äôt give me a time as to when he‚Äôd be back. I expressed I wasn‚Äôt okay with this and was starting to worry because I thought he was up to something. He was going with friends I‚Äôve never heard of and they were going to a park to just chill. I wasn‚Äôt okay with it and he went anyways. I broke up with him and blocked him on everything, I felt like my emotional needs would never be taken into consideration and that he didn‚Äôt care about me anymore. The next day I found myself missing him like crazy, I‚Äôve fallen in love with this man and can‚Äôt understand how things went so wrong. We‚Äôre so compatible and have felt like best friends since we‚Äôve met. The whole of yesterday and last night I was messaging him begging for us to work through this. I went to see my friends but left early as I needed to be alone. He expressed how he felt I had given up on him and he doesn‚Äôt want this anymore. I have been completely lost, I‚Äôve felt uncared for and disrespected and completely lost but understand he feels given up on. He blocked me on absolutely everything but left me on Twitter and so I messaged him carrying on. He rang me, told me he misses me and I carried on pleading. He said he needs until Wednesday (3 days away) till decide. What do I do? I can‚Äôt imagine life without him and I‚Äôm really struggling to deal with everything. Please give me advice.

"Hurt and confused This is decently long, but like the title says I'm really not doing too well and I really need some support. To anyone who read this. Thank you.

I haven't dated in around a year, by choice. I really liked who I became while being alone but recently I met someone. She's everything that I could ever imagine and more. And we've been dating for a short time but in the beginning she showed a lot of interest in me and wanting to be together as much as possible. And it was very nice, to be wanted just for who I was. We went slow all the way. Hugs to hand holding to kisses, to cuddling together till we fell asleep. I was falling in love fast. She really is special. Once we were talking about past relationships. She mentioned how someone asked her for a chance once he found out she was available, she said she wouldn't give him a chance and we kinda laughed. I asked her half joking if I had a chance. She said yes. Which made me very happy. 

Today we went to see a movie. While sitting I had a piece of candy on my lips that I wanted to share like those cheesy scenes in romances where you end up kissing. It was a playful thing but was I saw in her face was disgust. In that moment I just knew it was coming. 

We got back to her room and after some small talk she says there was something we needed to talk about.
She proceeds to tell me that while she likes to hang out and thinks I'm a cool guy, she's not ready to be anything serious. She tells me how she had been recently hurt and she doesn't know if she'll be ready for another serious relationship for a long time. It could be a year from now a week from now, she said. 
I told her I understood. 
She tells me that she hopes she wasn't leading me on and that she wants things to stay the same as in, cuddles and kisses. But nothing more serious than that. That she doesn't want to be in love and have to be thinking what that other person could be doing when they're apart. 
I told her that I understood, thanked her for her honesty. I said to her that I still wanted to be with her but I know understood where the line is.
We hugged and I left. 

I'm really really hurt. And I don't know how to deal with this.

"I'm (F27) not having sex while dating, so many men tell me they're interested or like me, even guy friends, but after a month they're like ""I'm not interested"".

They think I'm joking or that they're going to change my mind, and then when they realize I'm firm on my words after 1-2 months they're like ""I'm not interested"" or ""i was never into you I guess"".

"As a man how can you build confidence dating when dating is damaging your confidence So im M21 and i would say i 5-6 years ago i was somewhat confident, could start conversations with people would have a laugh be a bit cheeky and connect with people better overall

But whilst trying to find someone i found my confidence was crushed because after several rejections and no successes and added pressure from friends (im the only one in my friend group whos never been with a girl before) i felt incompetent in that area and that reduced my confidence and it had a snowballing effect on me, like now at a lower level of confidence its harder and then when you hear women say ‚Äúconfidence is key‚Äù is debilitating because i feel like how am i supposed to walk away unscathed from being rejected all the time. 

Its like imagine getting handed test scores for a math test only to find out you did far worse than everyone else , are you telling me youd not be less confident to answer a math question if asked in front of the class knowing you performed miles worse than your peers?

And for me its the same with dating as everything else in life you assess your performance and make judgments based on your capabilily. 

It got to a point where i feel so unsure of myself. Ive become very awkward and i only really speak when spoken to nowadays because i feel like im getting in peoples way or im being an inconvenience to them.  And i recognise thats not a good  place to be because you need to be able to communicate but its like nothing comes to mind anymore it feels like everything i say is pointless and just a waste of time.  Im just a spectator in life now its literally a movie i just look at what foes in around but i no longer engage with the world. It like i gradually shut away certain aspects of me and now its like i forgot who i used to be after silencing my self for long.

Now, after no contact for 6 months, I‚Äôve been on several dates with really great guys who are kind, sweet and normal but I just never feel the spark.

"How do I (M23) figure out the level of love my gf (F21) has for me TLDR : My girlfriend says I love her more than she loves me. But she doesn't show signs of distancing, she is always caring. Always wants to be with me and whenever i say i love her. She responds back with "" I love you more""

I've been with my girl for over a year. It's been great and I love her very much. She knows and appreciate my love for her.

Recently during a discussion. She talked about her previous relationship. And she said she received advise and also from what she feels herself. That the next man she is with . Has to love her more than she loves him. I asked her. "" So.. i'm assuming that you feel that I love you more than you love me?""

She said ""yes"".

That being said. She is very loving towards me. Whenever we don't talk for more than a few hours. She will text me. Professing her love. 
She tends to do this if i fall asleep. And i would wake up with lots of text from her saying how much she loves me and she gets worried I would leave her.
Which of course i proceed to comfort her.


She is very loving and caring. And shows love and do professes it. But I can't help but feel confuse with her stance.

"She chose him‚Ä¶ Stay friends? Or move on Or cut ties‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been numb since a few days ago.

For the past year I‚Äôve been romantically, physically and emotionally involved with a young woman in an open relationship.

In the beginning, she was taken. When we first met and started getting closer she ‚Äúmade an agreement‚Äù to open the relationship to be with me.

At first, it felt like we were dating. Then gradually over time, she became less and less available. I got the gist. She figured things out with her man and is done with me.

Last week, we met after not seeing each other for a while. We got dinner, i took her to a surprise show she always wanted to go to, and took her home. When we got there i tried to kiss her and she said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù

she began to almost cry and said that she likes me but she‚Äôs with her man. And that i make her the happiest she‚Äôs ever been. And that I shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äòwait‚Äô for her. She‚Äôs moving back to her hometown 4 hours away in a few weeks anyway.

* I complain a lot and confine with friends when people leave my life because of major attachment issues
* I don't workout
* I don't really trust people after constant fuck up's in relationships
* I don't speak my mind because I fear that everything i say will be too much and set everything up in flames
* I think i complain a lot
* I live in the past (I.E, When me and so and so stopped talking, if i was riding my bike and i pass their street i get off my bike and wonder where shit went wrong.)

"The guy I‚Äôm seeing is going on a reality tv dating show I have been seeing someone for a short amount of time. We both agreed that we wanted to take things slow, but I‚Äôve been sure to clearly communicate that I am dating with intention and that I am physically and mentally prepared for a serious relationship. 

We text every day and our dates have been
so fun and we have both expressed how deeply we‚Äôve connected. 

He‚Äôs tall, dark, handsome, extremely smart and successful in so many ways (currently obtaining huge national awards, magazine covers, etc). He‚Äôs an incredible person I have the utmost respect for him.

I found out he is soon to participate in a reality tv show in which a woman will pick a suitor. 

I don‚Äôt like to make assumptions, but I wish he had been more forthcoming on why he wanted to go slow, as the show must be an enormous, primary influence on that. He must be ready to be in a relationship if he is joining a show like this and it doesn‚Äôt match what he told me. 

As disappointed as I am, it is clear I should not
pursue this anymore and I will no longer try to romantically connect with him, but I‚Äôd like to keep him in my life as a friend. 

I am conflicted on whether to express my
feelings about the show or not. Do I tell him now that I just want to be friends? Do I continue to date him and wait until it‚Äôs closer to the show beginning? I don‚Äôt want to do anything that would jeopardize the chance of a friendship. 

I‚Äôd like to keep trying but I don‚Äôt think I am willing to compete with a rich actress/model on a tv show.

"How do I (m28) get intimate with my date (f24) and do you think she wants more than friendship? Hi,  I (m28) have always had problems getting intimate with a woman and  kissing her. I am 28 and have only had one relationship. My ex made it  even harder for me because she had some childhood trauma (and also cried  after sex because of it).

I get on dates reasonably well, can generate sympathy and am not extremely shy. But I can't make the next step.

Now,  finally, there is another woman (f24) I like. That never really  happened since my ex. I find her attractive, we share some interests and  she is chilled out. I met her through Bumble. We have met 4 times so  far and nothing has happened yet.

The  first time we met we went to several bars. The second date we had ice  cream. Now things are getting a little weird. Afterwards we talked about  kinks and ""money slaves"". She found it interesting and funny. I then  got her a ""cash and go"" meeting through another app. A guy met with her  and paid her 50 euros. We both found the experience exciting and she  tells me a lot about it.

Then we  had a 4th meeting at my house. We ate pizza and sat next to each other  on my couch for 3 hours. I often touched her thigh, tried to build up  closeness, but did not have the impression as if she wanted to kiss  me.After the meeting she also contacted me again. I slowly think I'm  slipping into the friend zone, but really want more.

The  chats are very basic. So real enthusiasm does not want to arise from  both sides. But I am also not the chat type. She has really given no  indication at all that she wants to be kissed and I am finding it hard  to take the initiative. She has mentioned once that she is also looking  for friends through Bumble. She also wants to go out partying with me  sometime.

Do you think she sees the whole thing only friendly?

Now comes the doozy. There's these other girls I work with, younger girls I believe, some underage (yikes), that have changed the way the act around me. They've been friendlier and talking to me more. A large part of me just wants to dismiss it as them warming up to me and enjoying working with me, but there's still a slice of my mind that's paranoid that I'm gonna accidentally break someone's heart, whether it be me letting them down or the heat of the moment making me do something to ruin my current relationship.

How do I go about this? Can I just explain it to them? I feel like that might come off as arrogant.  ""Hey, are you flirting with me? I have a girlfriend, so I'm not interested.""

Do I try to distance myself? I do enjoy their company, and it doesn't really strain our work relationship, it just pops up in my mind from time to time, the way they act.

"Times have changed, and id like to get some general advice to start dating again. After my (24m) last relationship Ive spent about 4 years working on myself, learning to be comfortable who i am, and trying to get rid of/learn to live with the baggage ive gathered. I wouldnt say im completely successful, but im atleast willing to try again. Growth and healing is fine, but its cost plenty of time and ive noticed an issue because of it. 

The issue is how much my own generation has seemingly gone full turncoat on each other and would rather treat dating as a means to an end. I know ive been under a rock for 4 years, but in that short time its almost become celebrated to treat your partner all kinds of wrong all while youre expected to take it not just by them, but society as a whole. It doesnt help that the criteria for what a ""good man"" is changes on the whim of whatever titktok these folks are cramming down their gullet that day. The expectations placed on people nowadays are seemingly WAY different and its like its impossible to approach anyone without seeming like some kind of creep or horndog. 

Ive tried a handful of times, offline and online, to at the least just talk with someone only to get ghosted, insulted, lied to, or led on completely. I definetly want to try again, as itd be foolish to assume that ALL women treat men like this. its just rough to be seen as some kind of predator or mark rather than as a man who just wants to cuddle and talk about his nerdy object collection.

"Some advice on core values in long term relationships Hi all, I‚Äôve been in a healthy and fulfilling relationship for the last 3.5yrs. My boyfriend (for this post we‚Äôll call him John) and I met right before the pandemic on Tinder of all places.

For this post, I wanted to touch on one aspect of our relationship that I think helped us a lot: complimentary core values. Hopefully by putting my thoughts to text, I can help you as well.

Basically, **don‚Äôt think about politics**‚Äì think about what *leads* to politics. Do you hold equality as key and so push for communism? Do you believe that a relationship with a deity is paramount, and so hold religious teachings above the wants and needs of any given individual?

My boyfriend and I both hold freedom for the individual as a core value. His reasoning led him to libertarianism while it led me to liberalism. These are different politics and we‚Äôve had a lot of debates on the merits of each and our conclusions on different issues. Because we were both starting from a core value of freedom for the individual, though, we are able to have a more stable relationship.

If I was a very devout Muslim who held my relationship with Allah above all (core value) and wanted to impose Sharia Law (politics) while John retained his individualist values and libertarian politics‚Äì this would lead to a lot of arguing. If neither of us changed our core values, it would put massive strain on our relationship.

Core values are where relationships make or break. If your values conflict, you will eventually have problems. Opinions and preferences (I think chocolate is gross, he loves it) really don‚Äôt matter to the stability of the relationship so long as they‚Äôre respected as opinions and preferences.

How do you understand your partner‚Äôs core values? Simple‚Äì ask! When John and I were getting to know each other on a deeper level, we watched those Jubilee Middle Ground videos to start conversations. We‚Äôd take IDR Labs tests for the same reason.

Yes, a lot of these conversations got heated. We‚Äôd yell, ‚ÄúHow can you believe that?! Insane!!‚Äù but always end the conversations with, ‚ÄúLove you, by the way!‚Äù so we knew there were no hard feelings.

The only reason we were able to have these conversations is because we knew ourselves. We knew who we were, who we wanted to be, and WHY. You have to put in the work to understand your value system before you start dating. If you or your partner don‚Äôt, hash it out over a few months, just be respectful about it.",RadioSphinx,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d7d0f/some_advice_on_core_values_in_long_term/,1690676628.0,1.0

I interpreted that as a complete rejection and I didn't ask again because I didn't want her to feel pressured or harassed. One semester later she chooses to sit next to me again during another class. We talk more, and on the last day of class she gives me her number without my asking because she wants to keep in touch with me.

"Help!!!! What do I do. I‚Äôm a 47 divorced female.  I have been texting and FaceTiming with a man I met on tinder since 2018. at the time we both understood that we were not interested in a relationship. I gave him my number and would text interactive romantic, passionate fantasies every once in a while, they got progressively more intimate through out the years.  last year I met someone different and started going on dates. I recieved an IM from my friend from tinder and told him I had met someone and thought that I could probably get into a relationship with this new person.  that is when he opened up and said that he wanted to be my FB. even though, through out all these years we had messaged about meeting our schedules never opened up.  throughout the years our desires got deeper for each other we did finally meet and had a very passionate romantic day my desires were met but had room for more.  after that we went back to the same sporadic romantic passionate communication we had prior. then he stopped for months,  I was hardly the woman that would make the first text out of respect for his young  children,  in case they had his phone.  one  night I worked the nerve and messaged him.  he replied and informed me he had moved out of state. we chatted that night and have been sporadically chatting and FaceTiming every once in a while again. I find this man very attractive, our way of interacting with these fantasies and our one passionate get together made me feel that maybe we could be more than this whatever we have. the last time we interacted,  he mentioned he was dating and thought he was ready for a relationship.  I told him I was dating but was very disappointed in the men that I was going out with.  he gave me advice for my next date,  I followed his advice, it did not work to say the least.  when I reached out to tell him his advice did not go so welll.  he replied with an emoji that implied that he was happy the date did not workout  I am confused on what this man wants.  he implies he wants me to go out with others and yet seems to get more active when I‚Äôm moving on towards my goal of a relationship.  he says he is ready for a relationship and dating but yet gives me mixed messages.  I‚Äôm thinking strongly of moving on from him and finding what I want.

"Will my living situation repel women if I put myself out there? I am a 27M and I would like some preferably female input regarding my lifestyle and living situation in regards to how (un)attractive it makes me in the dating market. 

I have little dating experience outside of a couple hook ups and 1 month ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù in high school. Since then many things have happened that led to to mostly giving up on ever finding a partner to start a family with. For as long as I can remember I have wished to experience the joys of fatherhood but I also told myself long ago that if I ever had children, I would need to still be young and healthy enough with enough energy to be an active participant in my child‚Äôs life. Meaning that I gave myself a time limit. If by 30 years of age I wasn‚Äôt a Father or soon to be one, I would give up on that dream. 

Which brings us to why I‚Äôm here today. I‚Äôm becoming increasingly aware of how my impending 3rd decade of life is quickly approaching, and that I must act just as quickly if I am ever to achieve the future I want. However, I also don‚Äôt want to waste my time, money and effort if it turns out that there‚Äôs no way a woman would date a man in my situation. 

I am 6ft and weigh 240lbs, average to below average looks, I work 5 days, 50 hours a week making deliveries in my car for a legitimate cannabis company. I own my own car, a 2022 Honda Civic and I make almost 60K a year. However I am currently co-renting a 2-story 5 Bed 3 Bath house with my parents as well as my (25) younger brother and his wife with 2 dogs as well. Moving out is not an option as I am an active contributor in the household beyond simply paying rent. I spend my free time buying and reading manga (I have 3 bookshelves and counting full of volumes I‚Äôve purchased) watching anime and playing video games. My greatest talent is my singing voice, I am professionally trained having gone to an arts high school, had several lead roles in theatre productions. I hate to sound like I‚Äôm bragging but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most proud of so I thought I should at least mention it. I only have 2 close friends and only 1 of them I see regularly where we hang out at his place where we smoke weed, watch anime and play video games (I know, my life isn‚Äôt very exciting) My work hours are from 1pm-11pm and I usually have 2 weekdays off so I don‚Äôt ever really have the opportunity to go out and enjoy the nightlife like most people do. I also don‚Äôt like to drink that much so I usually have a drink once every few months on special occasions. This is all I can think of about myself off the top of my head, I can answer questions about myself if this isn‚Äôt enough to go off of. 

So yeah, that‚Äôs the short of it. I‚Äôm under no delusion that my situation is in any way ideal for a woman looking to date a man. I am aware of how boring and uninteresting I come off to most people. I would just like some general opinions, do I have a modicum of a chance, or should I accept the fact that it‚Äôll be nearly impossible to find a woman looking to start a family that is also willing to settle for someone like me and give up on having children? 

TL;DR 
Is someone who rents a house with their parents and sibling and his wife, spends their free time collecting manga and playing video games too undesirable to date regardless of having a full time job and a slightly above average income?",InsecureDriver,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dey4s/will_my_living_situation_repel_women_if_i_put/,1690700719.0,0.67

I originally told him that based on some advice from my friends-but I've realized (late of course) that my opinion is the most important and that I actually do want to have some sort of physical relationship with this guy.

I turned him down about a week ago and he was very understanding and kind, but it's obvious he's switched to friends only mode. We don't talk as much and I saw that he's already updated his dating profile a bit. Which is ofc, totally normal considering that's what would be expected given what I said.

Is it even possible to remedy this?

"I keep thinking about a guy I had a situationship with &amp; wondering if I should tell him how I feel Our 2-month situationship was 2 years ago and we haven‚Äôt talked since, but we still follow each other on social media even though we both unfollow our exes. In many ways, what we shared was more romantic/beautiful than some of the official relationships I‚Äôve had. It started nonchalantly on a dating app we were trying out to casually chat with new people as the pandemic dragged on. Literally just to talk, not to hook up. We messaged for the 1st month and weren‚Äôt planning on meeting until we realized how much we like each other. He told me he got excited whenever I messaged him.

Then I initiated our 1st videochat which happened to be on Valentine‚Äôs Day and was really fun. A month later, we met in person twice and it was like a dream. We biked, cooked, watched tv, cuddled/kissed and led to 3rd base. He comforted me when I lost a loved one which meant a lot to me. We had happy hours and played word games. What I didn‚Äôt like though is that he is very sexual and wanted to watch porn together or have phone sex with toys during our chats, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised he wanted to have sex in person but I declined and he took it well. We were happy to just spend time together and finally meet after a build-up.

The sad yet also romantic part is that he was about to move away and any relationship for us would be starting long distance. He said he would‚Äôve asked me on a real date if that wasn‚Äôt the case. I had to step away earlier than he expected because I was developing feelings for him. He didn‚Äôt know that was the reason; I just told him I thought it‚Äôd be better this way since we couldn‚Äôt start a relationship anyway. Not long after that, he got into a relationship with this new chick and it broke my heart. Even if we weren‚Äôt talking, I didn‚Äôt expect him to move on so soon.

I recently moved to his favorite neighborhood (where we met, not where he moved to) and find myself thinking of him more. I never got over him and I think he‚Äôs single now. But I‚Äôm so afraid that he just said all those sweet things to keep me talking to him until he left. And that he just sees me as a hook-up. And that I would be making a fool of myself telling him how I feel and that it‚Äôs just me having a stupid crush. I also worry that his career is entirely different from mine, and practically speaking I‚Äôm not sure how sustainable it will be. What do you think I should do? Any advice or insight? Does he seem to genuinely like me or was just playing around? Thank you!

"She said that it was just a summer thing but the thing we‚Äôre doing right now seems like boyfriend a girlfriend thing. Should I be straight forward and ask her what does she wants in this ‚Äúthing‚Äù that we have? Because we‚Äôre not having sex (even though at first she said she wanted a hookup) and it‚Äôs just getting way too romantic for it to be a summerfling.

I (M18) met this girl (F18) during a friend hangout. We hit off and generally have a good time. At first I didn‚Äôt want to take thing serious and just want a summer fling. I then found out from a mutual friend that she also want the same thing. I then asked her if she wanted to hangout. We then kissed by the end of the hangout. Fast forward me and the same group hangout again this time with her. This time we both gotten really drunk. We then proceed to have a full on make out session. The furthest I have went was grabbing her chest, nothing more than that but we did made out for 2 hours straight. During the made out she told me that she loved me but I didn‚Äôt take it too serious as we were both drunk and she take those words back right away. 

We then hang out afterwards again but this time the kissed just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. It was a lot more passionate, the type of kissed you would get from a relationship. 

We would then start face-timing each-other frequently and even sleep calls. During one of the call she asked if i‚Äôm looking for something serious i then told her it‚Äôs too early to say. I asked her the same question and she said the same thing I said.

Now after multiple facetiming, we would facetime for hours, I then realize i‚Äôm falling for this girl. I would then ask her the same question she asked me earlier which was ‚Äúare you looking for something serious‚Äù. She would then respond ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs summer‚Äù. Implying that she don‚Äôt want it to be serious. I think that she knows that i‚Äôm starting to have feelings for her because I was a lot more invested into it. 
After all of this she still let me kissed her. 

So how do I tell her that I want more than kissing and making out (having sex) or tell her that I like her and make it serious. Neither is fine with me, I just don‚Äôt know how to approach this situation.

"The Update with me (22M) and the (19W) year old virgin from my initial yesterday post. Before I get into what happened a some hours ago. Firstly before i divulge today's affair. first i want to say quicky how we met late June. For context.

I'm in a local band(lead Guitarist)and after we perform more often than not we get some women who want to hang out with us after performing. 

One of those Girls(24f)that I had a a few physical experiences with I see randomly during the day and she introduces me to her friend who is the 19 year old. 


She then starts hitting me up on Instagram. We start talking. Just really jokingly, nothing unusual.

We met a couple of times which leads up to my last post of which we spent time in my apartment.

But back to today!

We spoke today at my apartment. And she was very, very fiery to say the least. 
When I saw the look her face. I knew it was going to be combative and it was going to be excruciating at times. 

For the first 10mins she just spoke quite angrily that I didn't show much in her opinion that I reciprocated her. Unfortunately she kept talking over me and cutting me off. I couldn't get a word in to explain. She loved getting the last word over me so I just let her have her Monologue. She spoke quite belligerent to be honest. It wasn't nice to hear. But I listened. And took on board the criticism leaved at me.

She then asks me directly. Do I even like her?
And I tell her that I am but I want to take things very, very casually. Then of course she fucking cuts me off and this really, really fucks me off. To segment things a say and not listen to Me in my entirely is unfair. I raise my voice and not word for word but I tell in essence to fuck off if she won't give me the opportunity/courtesy of speaking. Thankfully she listens. Finally. 

I explain that I didn't feel comfortable reciprocating her touching me and talking about sex given she was drunk. And she surprisingly said she wasn't exactly drunk which I didn't bothering arguing with her about since she was being templemental so I just essentially said I wasn't being rude or ignoring her. I just didn't think she was being serious when she said she wanted sex. She says it was obvious that it was Ok. 

We then talked about a few things and she asks me is it an 'issue that she's a virgin'?

And looking back. Not saying my spine turned to jelly but I probably should have been more forthright in my response. 

I told her 'not really'. But I'd happily have sex with her. I joke about make up sex being the best sex and she laughs which help elevate the mood. I then joke about being the sexist man alive which again gets a funny response and makes me feel lighter about everything.

I explain to her that I want to take things day by day. I tell we are still a huge way off boyfriend and girlfriend. Which she thankfully understood. She then tells me she's not seeing anyone or even speaking. Which I find encouraging.

She tells me she's happy after talking and that we should take a few days break of talking and 'definitely see each other again'. I tell her I agree. We then embrace and I plant a kiss on her left cheek. I then walk her out and say bye. She then audaciously give me a full on quick kiss on my lips as she leaves the main apartment building. I just laugh. You couldn't write itü§£üôà. Quite cheeky. Even hours later I'm still questioning if that actually happened! 

 And that's that. I feel like someone hit me with a baseball bat mid sleep. But there's a understanding now. And that's crucial.

Obviously I didn't like the shouting and vitriol from her. But she got her point across.",Formal-Crab-181,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15czoiq/the_update_with_me_22m_and_the_19w_year_old/,1690656448.0,0.77

"Would you pay for a set number of matches for a DA? 
The problem with all dating apps are that men heavily outnumbered women. Women has thus become too selective due to a sea of options but lack of quality, and men has become desperate and swipes right too easily.

 A dating app should somehow take into account this inherent gender ratio imbalance to increase match quality, to the benefit of both genders. To that I have some ideas:

- Severely limit the number of matches a person can concurrently have ( 1 or 2) . If they match with someone they are out of the swipe pool. -&gt; should make men much more selective.

- Monetization model should be based on number of matches instead of monthly subscription model. So say you pay 15$ for 5 matches. The match only counts after some minimum number of back and forth conversation. You get refunded if the profile is later reported and flagged as bot.

- The app should be free for women (to attract them using the app, to the benefit of men)

- Due to the change in monetization model the app can make  available all the features normally reserved for premium users of other dating apps (all kinds of filters, see who likes you, statistics, etc,...)

"Go From Talking Every Day To Not At All, Need Advice So I'll preface by saying I've \[30M\] only been seeing ""C"" \[26F\] for a couple of weeks,  but I haven't honestly navigated this type of scenario in god knows how  long so I need a bit of advice (or just re-assurance maybe). C and I went on a date two-ish weeks ago, and honestly I've never had more sparks fly; we ended up talking until the restaurant closed and she was the one to kiss me when we went to say goodbye, pretty good start right? Next day we ended up calling and chatting for a bit on the phone again, getting to know each other more. 

I had bought tickets for Oppenheimer and we were supposed to see them two days after the first date, but it turns out I had bought them for the wrong day, we ended up going out to eat, and afterwards sat in my car cuddling and talking for another three hours. We end up both sharing some traumas (her more so than myself), but overall still a great time. Next three days we repeat the same process, call at night to talk or a date (she came over for the next two and we just chilled), incredibly intimate experience but not much sexual (due to aforementioned traumas, we had a little bit of fun). This girl has literally said ""I wish I could stay here forever"" while laying on my chest, and I took that as a pretty good sign; I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive as a result - obviously it hadn't been very long but considering how things were progressing it didn't feel too out of place. I will say that I told her (and anyone I date) that I'm a bit more traditional and only date one person at a time, I get if they don't want to do that as well obviously though and am cool with that. Anyways after asking, she said she wasn't ready for that and we left it as is and left shortly after.  


Since then it's been close to radio silence, maybe one or two texts back and forth a day - we weren't texting a lot but it was more than that. She has been busy with seeing out of state friends for the past 3-4 days, but it's jarring to me that we went from being that close to near radio silence. Am I reading too much into it or do we take it as a sign that she lost interest due to asking to be exclusive too soon?

"The call lasted for an hour and it made me unmatch and cancel our date, was I too harsh? TLDR: As the title states. 

I (F21) recently scheduled a date with a man (M21) to meet at a local coffee shop for our first date. It would‚Äôve been my first date ever. But I cancelled it after I called him. 
My date was open about being autistic, i didnt mind as my very close cousin is also autistic. He explained in the phone call that he was high functioning and ‚Äúknew how to read social cues unlike a lot of others‚Äù. I assumed he was making a lil joke and giggled but he then got offended by my laughing. I apologized and to make things less awkward, I started asking him questions about his hobbies and interests. He then went on a rant that almost lasted for an hour about Star Wars. I kept trying to say something during it all but he kept spitting out random facts about Star Wars so I couldn‚Äôt. He would interrupt me and then after listening to random Star Wars facts, he finally let me speak and I didn‚Äôt wanna give up hope and started talking about one of my interests. I would occasionally ask questions for him to let him have a turn to speak but I got nothing but silence on the other end. I asked if he was there and he finally spoke and said that he was, the whole thing felt really awkward and I excused myself by saying I needed to take a shower and hung up. I then unmatched us.


Was I too harsh? I know people with autism get excited about their special interests but my cousin is also high functioning and is aware of taking turns talking in a conversation.

"how many dates until this is a bad sign How many dates until it‚Äôs a red flag that there‚Äôs still not been a kiss

So i‚Äôm fairly young here i‚Äôm talking to this girl and she‚Äôs admitted to me she likes me and i like her back we‚Äôve been talking for about a month we met first on our college taster day and i walked her home and i tried to kiss her as i always kiss the first time i meet so it‚Äôs obvious to them i still like them romantically after meeting in person however she moved away, she said she was really sorry and sent a lot of messages saying she was just nervous because she really likes me so i just brushed it off as she has only kissed one other boy compared to my seven girls so i wasn‚Äôt too worried although it did feel bad. so we went out again today and it was like a proper date we went to a nice restaurant and the movies however not once did we touch at all or kiss so i‚Äôm abit worried now as i‚Äôd think by the second time we‚Äôd at least touch each other especially at the movies, the worst thing is whenever i touch her in a non romantic way like i had to guide her body in a crowd so i used my hand and she kind of froze and i‚Äôm worried if she‚Äôs just disgusted by me touching her or something

when we spoke about the first kiss rejection she said next time would be different and after the nerves of the first meeting went she‚Äôd start the kiss since she rejected me first time but in the movies she seemed really closed off like she didn‚Äôt want to be touched, i kept looking to see if i could put my arm around her but the way she was sat made it impossible and like she didn‚Äôt want to anyway. i‚Äôve never had this before and it‚Äôs starting to effect the way i am with her, i understand sometimes people wait to kiss but the no touch really amplifies this for me

"been going out for almost 3 months, not sure what he wants I have been seeing the same guy since early May. In May he told me that he likes me a lot and we have been going out on dates nearly every week in the month of May and half of June. However, mid June, we went three weeks without hanging out. He was spending every weekend with his friends. I initiated the next date. We then went out again the following week, and last friday. we were supposed to hang out this Monday, however, he got called into work so he said if we can reschedule however he hasn‚Äôt rescheduled anything for this week. He was out with his friends yesterday and I think he‚Äôs going to be out with them again today too. 

We‚Äôve been spending a lot of time together, and I thoroughly enjoy spending time with him and now I‚Äôm kind of wanting some sort of exclusiveness with him. I want to have this conversation with him however, I also feel like it‚Äôs pointless because we‚Äôve been going out for almost 3 months and he hasn‚Äôt brought anything up about being exclusive or in a relationship. I feel like if he wanted something more serious, he would‚Äôve brought it up right now.

I noticed that I haven‚Äôt been receiving the exact same level of effort as the beginning. In the beginning we would hang out a lot like more than once a week. However, now we hang out maybe once a week (which im perfectly fine with) howe, it seems like he has a lot of time for his friends on the weekends. sometimes I think he‚Äôs not as interested anymore but then he tells me things how he‚Äôs going to help me move into my apartment next month and cook me dinners which seems pretty intimate to me. he also continues to keep conversation with me daily and when we hang out in person he‚Äôs very kind and sweet.  I want to have the conversation. However a part of me also knows that it could either go good or bad and if it goes bad I might not see him again out of awkwardness. I feel like if he wanted me to be his girlfriend he would‚Äôve said something by now.

The problem is that we're talking now, but he still hasn't asked me out on a date. I don't want anything serious; actually, I just want to have some fun and silly adventures, lol. I would have thought that if he wasn't interested, he would just stop sending me texts or replying to my stories. But he's always there (always). Now it's practically August, and still nothing. He flirts with me, wants to have sex, etc., etc. We do have fun chatting sometimes. But nothing happens outside of it, even though I've already suggested it to him, and he gave me an excuse. However, he suggested that one day he should come to my house. But for us to go on a date, he doesn't have the time, lol. I've already called him out on this, and he said that's fair, we should go out on a date. But... nothing. Yet he still talks to me every day.

  
While I was writing this down, I was thinking, Damn, how stupid am I... but seriously. He is so hot. He is attractive. He has a huge d\* lol. I don't want a boyfriend; I just want some fun. But he is a walking red flag.

"Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place? I‚Äôm confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don‚Äôt do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I‚Äôve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I‚Äôm confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Good enough for sex but not s relationship. So I have recently started dating. Went on a few dates with some women that didn't work out. Then I went on my last date with a woman twice and before I could set up a third she said she wasn't interested. I left it at that and moved on. A couple weeks ago by and I get a text that she misses me and still wants to talk but only as friends. I say ok even though I find it to be a bad idea (I find her very attractive and lovely) We hang at my place next to just watch tv and of course end up making out and doing some things. After she leaves she assures me that she doesn't want a relationship and we shouldn't have done that. She then comes back the next night for seven hours and it happens again only this time she cuddles with me and rubs my hand and lays on me afterwards. She even falls asleep on me. Again after she leaves and she says we are just friends and she just likes the attention. I asked her today why she won't see me as more and to be honest but she lies. After more discussion she admits she's not attracted to me like thst. I don't get that because then why does she want to sleep with me. I feel not good enough. It's really messed me up because I actually do enjoy her company and want more than sex. Im not sure if I should cut this off and stop communicating or just stay for now until she finds a bf and enjoy it.  I feel like I'm being used for the first time in my life and its a horrible feeling. I have never in my life been in a situation like this. I basically just need to vent my frustrations and talk about this out loud. Not exactly looking for an answer on what to do. I don't even know anymore.,LittleShowOff11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d0qsl/good_enough_for_sex_but_not_s_relationship/,1690659187.0,0.72
"Am I basically supposed to wait until I'm 26 before I can date? \[Tl;dr: I'm constantly bombarded with the message that unless I make money I'm not worth dating, but I can't start working until I finish studying in late 2025. Am I supposed to wait until then to get a relationship?\]

I (23M) have never been in a relationship. I've recently started doing the work to take more care of myself and to be more socially open. Nevertheless, I'm feeling pretty discouraged, because I feel there just aren't so many opportunities to make connections (I live in a Mediterranean country, where chatting up random people is not socially acceptable the way it is in America). I tried returning to archery as a hobby, hoping it would get me more connections, but everybody is either under 18 or above 30.

But what's been bugging me recently is how I constantly get messages from society and even individual people that basically I am not worth dating until I can make money. (Yeah, you'll now be thinking ""no shit Sherlock, nobody wants to be with a broke ass guy mooching off his parents!"", but bear with me). I graduated mere days ago. The whole process was an ordeal because Covid crushed my mental health like a hydraulic press does glass, so I took 4 years to complete instead of the canonical 3. I have weighed starting to work, but even after applying for some remote jobs to no avail, I realized, together with my therapist, that I'd rather focus on studying as soon as I start my master's degree in September; I calculated that if I started working, I'd be either studying or working at least 50 hours a week, and I'd have only one hour left per day (including sleep, showering, commuting, sports and so forth) which I see as unsustainable. Even my friends that work have said that they'll have to delay their degree due to this, something I really want to avoid this time. In the while, I'm decidedly NOT mooching off my parents - I almost never spend anything on myself except some McDonald's maybe twice a month. Everything else I take is just gifts for my birthday or degree, which I would get anyways. Also, bear in mind that we don't have a cultural expectation to move out of your parents' house as soon as you turn 18 - many people here move out late in their twenties.

So in short, I think I made a sufficient case that I'm not some slob playing videogames all day in his mother's basement, but I'm actively trying to build my life - just not in a way that makes me make money right now.

Where does dating come into play? Well, because as I said, I constantly get the message from society that men are only worth dating if they make money. In no particular order, I've had:

* Countless Tiktoks of women saying that \*not\* splitting the bill on dates is the ""bare minimum"" and that if you aren't making sufficient money to pay for them you shouldn't be dating in the first place;
* A female friend commenting that I ""can afford not working because I don't have a girlfriend, because girlfriends are an additional expense for men"";
* Girls evaluating men in terms of how many flowers, gifts, dinners and so forth they buy for them;
* A guy who commented that it's worse for men to be broke and, upon me inquiring, tacitly admitted that it's because of relationships;
* In general, even outside of conversation about dating, snarky remarks about me having no job yet

If it were just one instance of this happening, I would dismiss it as a shallow person being shallow, but after so many times I \*have\* to start believing they're onto something.

It does break my heart because all I want is to be loved by someone else, and I honestly don't care about ""scoring a 10"" or something. I think my only standards are: loving me, having something interesting to your personality. Even my looks requirements are pretty loose, I think. Even if I didn't make money I'd find a way to make my girlfriend happier, maybe by giving her emotional support, helping her out when she can't do something, validating her, making art for her, taking part in her interests, you name it.

Nobody has said this to me out loud, but I'd be happier if they just told me I have no chance at having a relationship until I have a job. Considering I'll be able to get a stable job only in late 2025 unless I quit studying, that means I'll only have a girlfriend when I'm turning 26.

\*But\* I'm also nervous about waiting until I'm 26, because at that point, it's also possible that women will just think it's a red flag (""what? No woman has wanted him after a whole decade? There must be something wrong with him!"").

"I've noticed my mood depends on guys behaviours. I've been noticing my mood depends on guys lately.

Before all this, I was doing quite good. I didn't had any guys or contact and was quite doing mentally okay.  
I have history of having really up and down periods. I also got some help from professionals with it. Because I got certain 'autism' that makes me feel 'emotions' very intense. Also gained some PTSS because of some really bad experience with an ex boyfriend that was a narcistisc that completely changed my life.

So my mood can be just up and down. Before this it was doing quite good. I distanced myself with guys, didn't have my old life anymore that depended on FWB, going out, and one night stands. And really went better mentally.

Until you meet someone unexpectedly when the first guy came with interest in me in my life. I made myself the promise I only meet up with guys if there a real potential to it, and say that to them also very clearly. So only serious dates. Nothing less.

So the first guy ive met, and also met up with, was quite fun. He told me after that, he wanted to date for real, and see where it goes. Unfortnaly we didn't live very close to each other (4 hour drive) but the contact was fun at first. But ive noticed his way of staying in contact wasn't the way I wanted it, His way of staying in contact online (whatsapp etc) made me trigger my PTSD somehow.

But what I'm noticing, when everything goes well in between us, my mood was so perfect.  
But when there was a slight change (or thinking there was, good in overthinkgin) my mood was downhill.  Like really downhill.  
Even at some point that I couldn't even do my job at that time when is was at the office. My mood really depends on how he was reacting to me.

I was feeling very down again, like almost at the tip of being depressed. Because my mood depended on him and how he was reacting to me.

I had several nights crying but the next day my mood was perfect again because it was okay again.

At some point I made to decision to stop dating this guy because our way of staying in contact wasn't matching for me. It was really hard for me to do that, but I couldn't handle it anymore.

Still noticed myself checking out his location something, because I was afraid that he was already seeing someone for example or Idunno, I just kinda secretly wanted to stay in contact, even I knew that wasn't a good thing to do.

Then I met suddenly someone else. Ive noticed I kinda forgot about the first guy real easy, so that was a relief kinda.

But now, with the new guy, ive notice I get in to deep with my emotions, that I know that if this gonna be fucked up (that it is kinda getting.. im afraid) im really afraid that I well be downhill again mentally.

I don't know what to do. I'm gonna be starting a new job in sept, and I just don't want such thing a distraction anymore..

It's just so not fun that me emotions can be everywhere depending on such things..

"I got broken up with but believe it was self sabotage from my boyfriend. How can I fix this and support him ? Hello everyone,

  
My boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. We have been dating for about a year and a half. He is the absolute light of my life : I feel loved, cared for, trusted and safe with him.  
Everything was going well. We met during our studies, but had to spend one year long distance (due to said studies), but managed to meet often. We were planning to get a cat and move in together sometime soon. I am absolutely sure he is right for me, and I have always believed I was right for him too.

  
Lately, he has been very busy, and I think he is burnt out. He said often this last few weeks that he feels low, depressed. I tried supporting him as much as I could. It was hard to see him hurt, but I knew it would get better. His visa is close to an end and he struggles finding a good job to renew it. He might have to move back to his birth country for a while, and I believe this adds on to the stress he is feeling.

  
He decided to break up with me almost out of nowhere. I felt so shocked I couldn't think straight and I didn't manage to say the things I wanted to. Now, I can't eat, I struggle to fall asleep but refuse to wake up because I dream of him, I spend my day holding his old tshirt in my hand. Common friends have mentionned their surprise in this turn of event, and agree with my perception of things. It could be self-sabotaging.  
He told me he loved me so dearly, and that he was leaving me so that I could be happy. I think he believes his depression brings me down, and that I cannot be happy with him. Yet, he made me the happiest and healthiest I have ever been.  
He says he struggles with guilt for ""not being good enough"". I think being rejected from jobs have reinforced his self esteem issues. he also says he needs alone time, which I understand and respect. He usually goes to therapy, but hasn't had time lately.

  
We will be calling again tomorrow, to talk about all this. I am planning on writing a text to help me say all I want to say : having written notes will help me stay calm and control my emotions better.  
About why I am posting this : I need help, I am lost. I never thought this would happen and im very unprepared to deal with it.  
Do you have ideas how to support someone with low self esteem ? How to show someone they are enough ? Ideas to improve communication in a relationship ?

  
Thank you so much for helping me, I wish you all the best.

  
TLDR : my boyfriend have self esteem issues, and feels he is not good enough for me. He is now burn out and broke up with me, probably as self sabotage. Now I need help : tomorrow we are calling, and I want to show him I am there for him and to support him, that he is enough and I love him. How can I support him better ? How can I help with his self esteem ? How can I show him he is enough ? Communication tips ?

"Perception of therapy in early stages I (hetero F) was having a chat with two friends (male and female) and therapy came up in the context of dating... me and my female friend agreed that if a man we're dating shares that he's in therapy, our response to that is 'a green flag'; whereas the male friend said that if a girl tells him she's in therapy, his response would be 'a red flag'.

I recently went on a date with someone I met on Hinge, we both agreed that it was a great time and wanted to see each other again, as we were texting I indirectly mentioned that I was in therapy, in response to 'how was your day?'. Since then, he responded my messages at a significantly slower rate - significant enough for me realise that he chose to 'take his time' and the second date never happened.

I'm not bothered by this as I wasn't super interested and generally speaking would not want to date someone who can't accept that I‚Äôm seeing a therapist, I am however wondering if this is a gender thing and applies to the majority of women/men.

"Is she's a gold digger? Hey, everyone! I (23M) had my very first date with this girl (21F). We met on a dating app and decided to meet the day after. BTW, I'm an introvert, and I was nervous and clueless as I didn't know how dates/meets work.

She asked me to meet her at the nearest metro station to her place at 5 pm. I almost reached on time, but there was a 40-50 minute wait until she arrived. We greeted each other, shook hands, and she started walking me towards a club.

We sat at a table, and she ordered some expensive drinks, such as French fries, a veggie dish, a glass of wine for herself, and a vodka shot for me. It was going well, but then she decided to have two more drinks, while I only had one more. She was a little flirty, asking if I could come over to her place after we finish here. She shared stories about how she lied to her mother to meet me, that she doesn't use Instagram because her brother said not to, and how she knows this place, etc... All her answers somewhat felt like a lie.

After some time, we asked for the bill, but she didn't even suggest that we should split it or something. I had to pay the expensive bill by myself. When we decided to leave, she made an excuse that her sister was going to pick her up, so I couldn't visit her place that day. While leaving the complex, we held hands and talked for a minute or two. She told me to WhatsApp her once I reach my place, so I did.

Now it's day two, and she hasn't even seen the message nor replied to it. I was curious and so checked her dating profile a few times last night to see if she's even online or asleep or something, but she was online, probably talking to other guys or finding new free drinks for herself, I don't know.

I didn't message her since she seems to be a gold digger, or am I wrong? Is this how typical dates go? I could use some advice here.",exist-without-name,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d6asu/is_shes_a_gold_digger/,1690673653.0,1.0
"I think this is evil Hello Lady's and gentelman,

I have a question directed especially for the lady's here.

I have been dating since I was a kid,Pretty intrested in the opposite sex,

Now almost all the girl's that I had I have met face to face  (there was a couple internet exception's..)(I dont have a problem to start chatting with a complete stranger face to face).

I am personally against using social media like facebook,tiktok,Instagram (especially) etc.. (I know that you can play with what you define as 'social media',But I dont include under this definition:dating platform's or website/forum's under this )

So I signed up to this dating site a short time ago,Put my personal info,add a couple of photo's and here we go.

Now I dont like it,since I know that there are situation's that there 200 guys on 1 chick and it can take time till she even see that you have sended her a massage...

I am pretty attractive guy (I try to be attractive from the inside too),I would say very handsome looking + working out seriously (Naturally,for almost a decade).

For this question I put my stat's,

My dry stat's: 1.79cm (should be around 5""10.5),and 96 kilos (around 18% fat for now).

Now,I saw this girl on the dating website,and she posted on her front page:""If you are above 1.80 talk to me"".

Now this thing really pissed me off on the personal level(she is 1.75,I dont say nothing about it for now).

I didnt even chatted with her or something (And of course I wont even chat with her,not beacouse of the height thing,But there is a whole list of requirements down there(dont have tatoos,dont have this long hair blah blah blah),And instead that she will write about herself a little more,about her personality,she is writing what she dont want in the man that will date with her..)I think it is easier to get a computer science/physic's degree than figure out what she want).

Anyway,I imagine,If I was into her,And We have met face to face,And I always try to be very nice or you can call it 'gentelman' especially in the beginning,(Also to understand who is this person in front of me etc),If she is a mentally healthy person,She would never had said ohh you are too short for me (I know that in this case it's 1 cm and she wont care about it anyway,But this is not about me).

Like what if a guy is 1.70 and the girl let's say 1.75?or 1.78?

What you wont date a guy only because of his height?

What if someone shorter so he is not ""good enough""?what is this?

I know that this height thing is mostly BS,And either way woman will be attracted to a guy that know how to talk to her,rather than for technical 'physical stat's'/appearance.

And I personally had girls my height (even that I rarely meet girl's this height or taller),we was in great relationship,and even I was asked by one of them (from her side) to go out on date.

So I want to hear your opinion.

Thanks for your time.

"Dealing with a summer romance Hi everyone, I'm feeling a bit down and would like to hear some opinions/advice from other people.

I got the opportunity to do an internship in Berkeley this summer and thought I'd find myself a summer fling. I was on the apps for maybe a month until this guy pops up and messages me. He's bi and exactly my type. We met up and I told him that this would just be a fling with no strings attached. We hit it off right away and got physical. I had never enjoyed sex before until him. The wonderful thing was that he stuck around, cuddled, kissed me and told me he enjoyed my company. I had never experienced it before and it struck something inside me. I think I started falling for him.

We spent time together almost everyday after that. I have a hard time opening up to men and being vulnerable. And when I've allowed someone so far in, it's hard to let them go. I talked with my friends and I was determined that I would just enjoy my time with him because this would be a great first experience overall. Fast forward to now, we just came back from a road trip we did to Monterey to go hiking in Big Sur. It was the happiest I've ever been in a while. We spent time again last night and he reminded me not to get attached and that I was only temporary Spoingus (a pet name he gave me). The word temporary hit a nerve and I felt sad. I asked him how he would feel when I'm gone and he told me that he'll be sad but he'll be fine. 

I was fully fine about the fate of whatever this was until he called me temporary like I was disposable. It just felt a bit demeaning. He's confused me so much. He acts and treats me the way people would in a relationship yet he tells me to feel differently. Why has he behaved like we were a couple this whole time (pet names, kissing, handholding in public, talking about family, etc)? If a fling was all he wanted, he could've just kept it physical. It's my fault for not setting boundaries and attaching more meaning to it.

Can someone help snap me out of this haze? I'm thinking of ending whatever this situationship is now.

I am still a beginner at just a few weeks. Ideally, I'd love to find someone who's not only interested in practicing salsa together but is also open to socializing or dating if things click. I enjoy salsa dancing and so I wouldn't strictly want to just date. 

As far as how to ask these women, what do you recommend I say?

"Talking stage/ dating advice 24F and 25M. He‚Äôs in south Fl and I‚Äôm in central FL I‚Äôm (24F) starting to get back into dating and decided on using hinge. I dating a couple guys in college but some never reached the official bf/gf title stage. Anyways, he‚Äôs (25M) and he lives in Miami and is the owner of a family medicine clinic. He told me that‚Äôs he‚Äôs about to open another location in Aventura and lately he‚Äôs been traveling for conferences across the US. 

Long story short, I paid for Hinge X bc I wanted to see better quality men and I set my settings to find people in Miami (when I live in Orlando lol). I got his IG and then we moved to texting. So far he seems really nice and we vibe. Only thing is the past week I‚Äôve gotten a text like once a day replying and or ‚ù§Ô∏è some of my text responses. Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking but is that a üö©? He might just be busy since he texted me that a couple times but i heard someone else say no man is that busy. Again it‚Äôs been a hot minute since I‚Äôve talked/ dated and my previous encounters were in person so Ik online can be different. My sis said that‚Äôs not a red flag since I technically hear from him once a day in the talking phase.

Do you think the distance in the potential relationship could work? Orlando to Miami is like a 3 1/2- 4 hour drive or 1 hour flight on the weekend. If all this actually works out I can‚Äôt wait to be all over this man. Ngl I‚Äôm struggling to not message something crazy but I don‚Äôt want to put out the wrong vibes yet and get to know him. Ladies not sure if it‚Äôs just me but I feel like once you start to go down that rabbit hole with men it‚Äôs hard to turn back lol. I‚Äôll give it 2-3 months time.

A question for the ladies: When do you think is the best time to bring up sex? I know some friends that do it after a couple dates, others a few months into the bf/gf title, as soon as they are official, etc.",basicstudentgkco,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d4zh4/talking_stage_dating_advice_24f_and_25m_hes_in/,1690670066.0,1.0
"Help me be seen as more I (25f) have come to the realisation that I‚Äôm mostly seen as a sex object, maybe more so than the average women (based on discussions with other women) I have been used for sexual reasons before, and I seem to make even the most wholesome or average men turn into horn dogs even in the beginnings of innocent conversations.

I met this guy just a couple weeks ago and we‚Äôve seen each other a few times and text every day, he is so sweet and romantic, but he just told me so nonchalantly yesterday that he‚Äôs moving a thousand miles away next month.

"I recently left a relationship, met someone new, and I don't feel happy? I never been in a relationship, so when I met her, I thought we were going to get married. I didn't realize that I'd be played with like a toy for 7 years of my life.  
  
For years my gf took advantage of my kindness, my trust, and anything she could find about me. She cheated all these years multiple times over and over and over again. Because I believed I loved her, I'd forgive her thinking she would change. She never changed.  
  
She would cry, say she didn't mean it, say it was a mistake, say she didn't know why she did what she did, and most importantly.. say she wouldn't know what to do with her life without me.. so I would forgive her.  
  
Then she would continue to cheat.  
  
Interestingly, none of these guys wanted to be with her at all. She would always come telling me that they cheated on her and that she is sorry for what she did to me. She knows she is not attractive so she keeps trying with new guys. I know they didn't like her because they always left her for other girls a week later. Most of the time, they would use her and ditch her.  
  
Having a soft spot in my heart for her, seeing her cry and admitting her mistakes, I'd always cave and forgive her. Like clockwork, she'd go back to cheating again, only to be dumped by these guys.  
  
Why did I stay with her? Was it love? Fear of being abandoned? She's all I've know for all these years, even though it was panful.. I don't know. Was it the crying?  
  
After leaving her and to my surprise, I found someone.  
  
Someone amazing, someone smart, someone kind, someone sweet, someone years younger than her. She not only head of heals over me for me, I think I might marry her, and we've only known each other for a month!  
  
I finally feel like I know what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. After 7 years of being cheated on, lied to, emotionally manipulated, having my feelings played with, I finally found someone.  
  
Yet why do I still think about my ex even though she was so horrible to me? Why do I still answer her text and calls? Why can't I block her? Why am I still hopeful in getting back with her?

"Nut sure how to find women I'm on the autistic spectrum and my interactions face to face are always awkward as I seem to have weird mannerisms. 20 years ago (I'm almost 35 now) I managed by meeting girls through forums/chat rooms so that we could develop a certain level of trust over a few months before actually committing to a relationship and seeing each other's faces.

Nowadays, this isn't ideal any more, women are tired of being pestered online and it's more common to rely on apps specifically designed for dates. My problem with this is that I don't really have interesting photos of myself simply because I don't like getting my picture taken and thus got nothing for those kinds of apps. Not only that, my personal style is not something that women nowadays like and thus if the first impression they get is my face, there's a high chance they'll just not be interested.

Now, of course, a solution would be to fix u my looks so that that they match the current fashion trends, but I'm just not that kind of person. I am the kind of person who likes wearing his hair really long, and wear shirts and jeans everywhere, and I feel comfortable being a skelly.

"Breakup and new girl I am 25 years old. Nine of last ten years i was in relafionships. Three of them were pretty long - 2 years, 2 years and last one was 4 years and i was living with this girl in one apartment for 3.5 years. She broke with me 6 months ago. 

I learned a lot from that and i dont blame her. I was good boyfriend but made some mistakes and got too comfortable at some point. I am sure that we will never be together again, even if she would want to. I dont know if I ever be fully over it - we both stepped in adulthood together, learned a lot of things and had kinda special connection I think. Breakup made me kinda different person, but busides that i party a lot since then it was change for good. It made me trully confident and I am for first time in my life able to fully control my emotions and got my true self back. For whole life I was guy that belevied in true romance and I think for now I kinda lost that and I am more realistic. It hurts to accept new reality, but I am fine with that. I think i got my shit together as a man and I am on right life path.


For the past months I flirted with a lot of girls, slept with 4 ones. I am pretty attractive men and never had problems with girls. But lastly I got to conclusion that pursuing with girls that i know I dont want to be with in long term relationship is pointless as I quickly lose interest in them. I got big thing for high inteligence in girl and I care about that even more than looks - some girls that were unatractive for me from start and then i noticed their Intelligence turned to be hot as fuck for me. 

Two months ago i met a girl that is in unhappy relationship, this is her first guy and she is with him for 4 years but from what I noticed she is scared to leave him, she is 22 years old. From the start we both clicked very hard and I rarely view girls as relationship meterial. It never got physical and month ago we decided to take a break from each other. I think she is still in relationship with this guy - she is kinda scared of me beacause i gave her player vibes as there were a lot of women around me when we met. I know this is red flag, but my intuition which rarely lets me down tells me to take that risk.

As I stated before party a lot recently and I know I wont stop untill i will have someone that i will truly want to take care of. Constant partying is not in line with my fitness and life goals, but there is really no way for me to stop it when I am single, i really know that part of myself. I think in next weeks I will decide to contact her again. I dont think if it works it will be rebound relafionship but I am not sure as I stated before my whole life I was jumping from relationship to relationship.

"Men, I'd like to hear your opinion My name is Kira, and this is the story of how my life took an unexpected turn. I've always been a slim girl, and it was something I never paid much attention to until I met Alex. He was charming, and we quickly fell in love, seemingly perfect for each other. Little did I know that my body would become a source of heartache in our relationship.  
At first, Alex never mentioned anything about my weight. We were happy, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. But as time went on, I started to notice him acting distant. He would make subtle comments about my appearance, hinting that I should gain weight. I brushed it off initially, thinking he was just concerned about my health.  
One evening, as we were sitting in a park, the sun setting behind us, Alex finally gathered the courage to talk about what was bothering him. His words struck me like a dagger to the heart.  
""Kira, I've been thinking a lot lately,"" he began hesitantly. ""I care about you, but I can't help feeling like you're just too skinny. It's hard for me to see us having a future together like this.""  
Tears welled up in my eyes, and I tried to hold back the pain that was bubbling inside me. I couldn't believe that my body, something I had no control over, could be a reason for someone to break my heart.  
""You mean you're breaking up with me because I'm too skinny?"" I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion.  
""I just don't think we're compatible in that aspect,"" he replied, his voice gentle but unwavering.  
Feeling a mix of anger and sadness, I stood up, looking at him with a newfound determination. ""You know what, Alex? I refuse to let anyone dictate how I should look or feel about my body. If you can't accept me for who I am, then maybe it's best we go our separate ways.""  
And with that, I walked away, leaving Alex behind with his shallow beliefs. In the days that followed, I struggled to come to terms with the end of our relationship. But gradually, I began to find my strength again.  
I surrounded myself with supportive friends and family who reminded me that I was perfect just the way I was. I focused on my passions, my dreams, and found joy in activities that made me happy. Most importantly, I learned to love myself, flaws and all.  
As time passed, I realized that Alex's rejection had been a blessing in disguise. It had taught me to value myself and to never compromise my self-worth for anyone else's approval. I began to see my body as a symbol of resilience and strength, not a flaw to be fixed.  
And as fate would have it, in the most unexpected moment, I met someone new. A person who embraced me for who I was, who saw beauty in my uniqueness, and cherished me without trying to change me.  
Looking back, I am grateful for the pain I endured because it led me to a greater understanding of myself. I am no longer defined by someone else's standards of beauty. I am Kira, a strong and confident woman, loving myself just the way I am. And that is a love that no one can take away from me.",KiraRai69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15d1ctj/men_id_like_to_hear_your_opinion/,1690660777.0,0.6
"Advice moving forward. Hello,

So I am thinking about deleting Tinder and Hinge. It does not seem to be going anywhere. Unfortunately, the men on these apps (from the 30+ I have gone out with at least) don't have much depth to them, just want sex, are super shy, lie, or have massive egos. I am just saying this about the guys I have gone out with on these apps not men in general. 

I like to talk about intellectual topics (science, history, philosophy etc.), but I can not seem to find guys that are intellectual on these apps despite the fact that many claim to be intellectual.

I still want to date, however I attend a really small university that has a 7 girls to one guy ratio. Most of the guys are taken which is fine and I am happy for them.

I am premed and I try to do premed internships. However, there are very few men in these internships. The majority of which are taken.

"How to deal with certain feelings I'm a 21 M and my problem is I always get feelings for girls who are either already in a relationship or are older than me. And then what happens is I get my heartbroken and just to feel better, i tend to make fun of them which I absolutely hate. And also what hurts is i make fun of the things which I love about them. I don't want to do that. How can I deal with these emotions better? I don't know why I catch feelings that easily for someone.

"Not sure what to do I (M33) have been dating my girlfriend (F25) for a little over 6 months. Background: we‚Äôve met each others family‚Äôs and had all the future plan talks. Just moved in together.

She tends to go out every weekend with her girlfriends which I don‚Äôt mind most of the time. However, last night was odd.

I‚Äôll also preface this by saying we used to share locations with each when going out early on and then we just left it on.  

So she went out with her friend (F24) for some guys bday that they both knew. I had met him one time as well, super cool gay guy. 

We normally communicate with each other throughout the night via text. Around 12am was the last text she responded to, I noticed around that time her location changed to a couple miles down the road. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it until she didn‚Äôt respond to me until like 2:20am. Around that time her location showed her somewhere else in an apartment complex.

She gets home, gets in bed and tries to go to sleep right away no kiss or hug or even look at me. I saw that as odd. I said hey I missed you, come here. And she rolled over. I asked how was the that guys party? You were there pretty long (she doesn‚Äôt tend to stay out at a house party that long). 

She responded saying it was it was a chill vibe but musty but didn‚Äôt say anything about going anywhere else. I asked where her friend was bc normally she‚Äôll sleep over if they go out and her stuff was here. She said she went somewhere with some guys and wanted her to come but she wanted to come home. Another note: my girl was super drunk

All these things don‚Äôt add up to me and then while she‚Äôs sleeping her phone goes off several times. I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to check. Some guy in her contacts named ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù has a few messages showing. I check her phone and it‚Äôs a guy basically texting her wanting to fuck. The message thread goes back to last Sunday, where he says what are you up to queen, I want to take you out on a date to which she replies omfg I can‚Äôt stand you hahah 

Then yesterday night he sends her $100 via apple pay and says he wants to eat her out from behind. She responds saying Dam he ain‚Äôt playing, and this was while we were watching that new who cloned Tyrone movie on Netflix.

He sends her like 7-8 more messages throughout the day to early this am basically telling her he wants to fuck her. She hasn‚Äôt responded. I also noticed she payed some guy Dom 10 bucks via Apple Cash last night. 

Sorry for the long read, but I felt context was necessary. I‚Äôm going on a trip to Europe tomorrow with her and I don‚Äôt know what do. Should I be tripping? And do I confront her? Advice needed

"Shower thought: I'm finally old enough to date the men I actually want This is my secret controversial opinion lol. Getting to my mid-20s has finally allowed me to date late 20s-early 30s guys. My partner now is in that age range and I absolutely love it. I've always been annoyed by the lack of maturity of the younger guys who surrounded me. I've secretly liked older guys the most for many years now but, obviously, I couldn't date them before. And they wouldn't date me, either. But now I have finally found the mature, stable, sexy (silver foxes rule ;) ) partner I've always dreamt of. And he likes me back!! Life is nice.

Edit: wow, seems like my opinion really is controversial haha. Some of you commented that age does not equal maturity and I agree with that. However, there really is a huge difference between a 20 yo and a 30 yo. Surely, we can agree on that? As for why I couldn't date them before - unbalanced power dynamics give me the ick. As a 20 yo, I had no business dating men 10 years my senior. I was a na√Øve a child by comparison and I knew that, so I purposely didn't pursue them.

"Am I just not cut for dating? Be nice please. :( So I'm male. 32. With a learning disability. Looking for a job. Still living with parents because the town I live in is small and we barely have apartments here etc. I'm struggling with looking for someone. I've always been rejected because of my disability. I feel like no woman wants me etc. I've been psychologically emotionally manipulated in High School which gave me severe PTSD because I got bullied and got rejected. 100% true story. Dealing with trauma. Just asked a girl out. Trying to face my fear. She rejected me but she was nice. Think I've handled it well. I also have an over protective mom. Love her to death but she refuses to let me date. I don't know why to be honest. Maybe she thinks me getting rejected again will trigger my PTSD? Any advice guys? My trauma was so bad the girl in question accused me of stalking. Lowered my self esteem so bad I felt like I didn't belong in the school etc. Now I'm having recurring nightmares etc. Let's say she was a narcissist at its finest. Currently going to therapy. EDIT: I always seem to attract TOXIC women. I don't know why??? Even tho I'm a nice guy. It sucks really.

What should I do I need to date someone eventually. I just don't want my mom telling me not to date is all. She keeps saying I have allot of growing up to do on top of that I need a job and need to get my license. Reason I don't have my license is we moved allot. And I have a fear of driving and dying in an accident that I'm trying to get over. I know all the answer for the written test. Just I don't know allot of my friends keep telling me I'm better off being single because I'll have more money and I'll be more happy. But being single is just making me miserable to be honest. I get told I'm a likeable and lovable guy. And I make allot of people laugh and I make girls laugh too. I've been catching girls checking me out lately but I'm too afraid to make a move on them etc I don't like cheesey pick up lines etc. I want to get to know them FIRST and take shit slowly etc. I dont want to rush a relationship if that makes sense.

Struggling with depression because I'm afraid of the same stuff is gonna happen again if I ask a girl out. Etc.

The story is on my profile, however to summarize, my gf has gone through a busy schedule resulting in mental exhaustion and burn out. She told me she cannot handle committment of a marriage though she loves me (thats what she told me in our conversation). I managed to calm her down by assuring her that I will be with her till the end and there is no pressure of marriage, im there regardless. 

For the next 2 weeks our conversations were dry, although I got responses to ""I love you"" and such, things have now gone confusing. She would message first, the conversations are not so dry anymore, they are improving gradually but romance is non existence. Just last time around I would say ""i love you"" and she replied with an ""ilyt"". The next day she would go on message first. Yesterday she didnt reply back with the usual heart emojis, but again messaged first.

"My wierd way of thinking Hi. I'm M26, I haven't been in a relationship yet but I've had sex a few times. When I meet someone I immediately think about having sex with her and how to approach it. For that I feel guilty and I just get down on myself. Especially when I want to make pervy talk about sex theme - I'm always afraid she won't appreciate it and she'll add me to her blacklist.

Sometimes I don't know what to talk about with her.

"UPDATE: I (24F) feel unsure about the relationship I've been in with 31M Hi everyone. My post didn't gain much traction, but I do want to thank those that took the time to comment. I did read everyone's comments, but I didn't respond. Here's the update:

&amp;#x200B;

He decided taking a break was silly, so he decided he wanted to try again, which I agreed to with the boundary that if he emotionally whiplashes me again, I will be leaving. Honestly, though, I didn't feel much of an urge to go spend time with him or be with him. This week I had a psychiatry appointment and a therapy appointment in which I started to talk to my therapist about how I often find myself in unhealthy relationships with men. One of the things that we talked about is knowing my value and setting boundaries and expectations of how I should be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, today he and I decided to try to hang out. Part of me was actually really excited. I missed him. He told me he was missing his girl as well. We started to call, and the topics just felt kinda strange. He was immediately asking me about therapy and what my therapist thinks about how we mesh, or what types of things don't mesh well for us. I felt a little uncomfortable because I feel like what I speak about in therapy is really up to me whether I want to disclose, and despite me saying that the therapy appointment wasn't specifically about him or anything he still pushed for answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to screenshare myself playing a game and I got slightly frustrated and made a couple comments that a particular combination of powers in this game was kinda annoying to deal with. He then asked me if I'm frustrated why am I playing it. I said I'm not that frustrated and I'm having fun. He's made comments in the past about the games I play, that I shouldn't play games that frustrate me, etc. And it's like... Idk I would think he would understand because he himself plays games, but there's times where a game might be slightly annoying but you still enjoy it, right? But anyway, he ended up hanging up on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to discuss what happened with him, that I don't like when he makes comments about the games I play and when I should and shouldn't play them. He then guilt tripped me, saying ""I guess I'm just a piece of shit then"" and ""well excuse me for caring about you"" and finally blew a fuse, telling me to ""fuck off"" and ""fuck you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I finally have had enough of his emotional instability and immaturity. I don't believe I deserve to be spoken to in that way or treated the way he has treated me. Just prior to me sharing my screen, he had told me that nobody he's ever been in a relationship with has ever been as good at ""conflict resolution"" as I have with him. But then he does this. He's just so volatile, and it's either everything is great or everything is awful with him. I have members of my family that have bpd, and I realized the way he acts sorta these two extremes feels kinda similar to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And regarding him pressuring me for sex, I'm really glad I didn't give in. He hasn't really made me feel cared about in quite some time despite it being such a short relationship. I'm not sure what his intentions were with me, but I don't think I'll ever find out. I've now blocked him and I'm ready for a chapter of peace and healing now. I will be working together with my therapist to get to a healthier spot with myself before pursuing another relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess kinda a sad update but probably not one that was unexpected. Thank you to those who took the time to read and respond. I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some helpful tips for my little situation (Dating/social skills)

So I‚Äôve recently started talking to this girl, she‚Äôs 28, I‚Äôm 29. We used to go to the same school years ago but never really spoke to each other till one day she decided to reply to one of my instagram stories.

We got to talking and it seemed pretty good.. at this point we‚Äôre probably more friends than anything else.
We‚Äôve hung out twice now, first time was good, we went for a walk, a week later (last night) we went for another. 

After I dropped her off last night I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit bummed out about myself, this girl is absolutely out of my league, shes beautiful, she is a PhD student, works in a university teaching other students.. when we were together the second time she did most of the talking. I‚Äôm shy and I can‚Äôt really find anything to talk about that we‚Äôd have in common. She‚Äôs a little formal and it comes off intimidating. Would love to be able to carry the conversation but feel like I can‚Äôt be my joking/humoured self.. she might potentially be into me, she texts me first, she mentions hanging out again.. but I think I need to do more otherwise it‚Äôll die pretty quickly 

Ps - i probably felt more comfortable the first time we hung out, it was easier to talk to her but i think it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt talk about her phd as much as she did the second time around (I have absolutely no idea about a PhD and the things she studies)",RlTTENHOUSE,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cpdqx/need_advice_social_skills/,1690628051.0,1.0
"Help! When to break up TL;DR I've been seeing a guy for a few months (only about once or twice a week, though, so it still feels pretty new). However, I'm now pretty convinced it won't work out long term and I need to end things sooner rather than later, but the timing is horrid and I don't know if I should just bite the bullet and deal with the messy fall out or let things drag out for a month and then end it when there won't be as many complications.  
A few months ago, I met a guy at a mutual friends birthday party (she was hoping we'd hit it off, so it was a bit of a set-up). And, it was fun and exciting at first, but then we kissed and I instantly lost all feelings of attraction when he initiated a French kiss. For context, I've never kissed anyone before nor been in a serious relationship (which he knows). So, I don't know if I just don't like French kissing or if it's related to him.  
A few days after the kiss, I managed to stop thinking back on it with negative thoughts and get my feelings to mostly neutral, but I can't get the attraction back. We kept meeting up, although only about once per week (we were both doing a lot of traveling and I wasn't really pushing to meet up more, although I think he would have liked to). I really enjoy spending time with him and we go out and have fun together, but my sexual attraction towards him seems to be stuck at neutral.  
He's been really nice and is very clear that we should go at my pace, and I was planning on going all the way with him at some point (I need to get some medical stuff done, so I can't right now anyways). But, I'm realizing now that might be worse to have sex when I'm not really feeling it and then break up shortly afterwards? I felt like I owed him something for being so patient (no pressure from him), but now I realize it's maybe more likely he'd feel used?  
The other night, we had a heavy make-out session (all but PIV). And, it was nice but honestly not more than that. And, he seems to be getting more interested and wanting to spend all our time together while I'm just as happy on my own. The last few times we've met up, I've tried to be more careful about not giving him a compliment back just because he gave me one and only saying things if I really mean them, which has definitely led to me receiving more compliments than I'm giving, but I don't know if he'll pick up on that as a clue that I'm not feeling things and drifting away or still be completely blindsided.  
The major problem I have now is when to do it. We'll have to see each other at least a couple times in the next few weeks as we're working on a project together. The only way to avoid that would be if I almost completely cut contact with a lot of my friends for a month since he's more integral to the project than I am (they know we're dating, though, so I think they would understand me wanting to give him space, but I still think it would make our friendship suffer). Additionally, my birthday is coming up in a few weeks and we just started talking about plans for it. I would have really loved to invite everyone over (his friends and mine) and have a party. But, I don't want to drag this out and feel like either now before we actually plan anything for my birthday is the best time or after the project and my birthday have passed. I fear no matter what I do, he's going to feel blindsided and heartbroken. And, I genuinely would really want to stay friends (especially since our friends groups overlap), but he seems to have really strong feelings towards me, so I'm worried that won't work out.  
Is there a way I could gradually end things over a month that would be less painful?  
And, should I go with my plan of saying I really like him as a person and friend, but my sexual attraction towards him just isn't there and he deserves someone to love all of him? Or will that just open the door to bargaining?

"My bf (straight 17M) is mad at me (bi 17F) for having a sleepover and sleeping in the same bed as my straight (17F) friend. Recently, I had a road-trip with one of my closest friends (who I have only ever viewed as platonic) and when I asked my bf if he would feel more comfortable with me sleeping on the couch rather than a bed with her, he said it was up to me whatever I do. I have slept on the same bed on similar road-trips in the past with this friend before I met him, so I decided to take the bed with her and told him I was doing so. Everything was fine until the next day she told him that in my sleep I would flail my limbs around unconsciously and at some point my leg ended up on top of her.
He grew extremely angry thinking I did it on purpose with flirty intents and has since been very hypocritical, saying a lot of things that I do with my female friends that he does with male friends are different because of my sexuality. I am extremely sad because of the increasing distance I have to build with all of my friends regardless of gender.

I mean as long as you're not looking for something casual, or that you're not for example in a place just for a few months and are looking for a casual partner just for the time you're there etc. you're automatically dating "" for life "" right ?

If a relationship lasts 1 year - 3 years, it's just because it didn't work out, I'm not sure anyone is looking to date for 3 years and stop.

"I (M21) getting confusing signals from my friend (F21) I have this female friend situation i really need some advice here

For context im in my early twenties so is she. Ive known her for about 2 years now and have been friends since. We met over a mutual friend. And I notice that Im starting to fall in love with her. The problem is‚Ä¶ she really confuses me

When I ask her do do something she says yes when she has time and seems exited to see me shes very touchy and cuddles with me when were on a couch or something. She takes random pictures of me and even had me as her lockscreen on her phone. But shes not a big texter and very rarely asks me out back. 

The way shes physical with me feels like shes trying to make me make a move.  For example we where lying on my bed and shes hugging me and lying on top of me for a little bit but as i do nothing she stops hugging me again, slaps my but jokingly or starts playfights. 

The problem is that she says she doesnt like men and relationships or intimacy that way. She even had a girlfriend before.

Im not making any moves because she told me that but i feel like she also gives different signals. Im also pretty insecure and scared about relationships since ive never been intimate with a girl before. And have been hurt badly before. 

What im i suposed to do im noticing im falling in love and i dont know what to do i cant read the situation properly but i also dont want to loose her as a friend. And i dont want my heart broken again:(

"Relationship problems Me (21F) have been in a relationship with my partner (21M) for almost a year now. We are very different in many ways, he is more extroverted and I am very introverted. I would say overall that our relationship has been pretty good. 

However I can't help but worry that we might be too different, he is of more conservative values and I'm more open minded with how you dress, what you do and stuff... generelly. So sometimes I feel like the things I want to do in life is without his support nor understanding. And lately the things he's saying and doing really upsets me. 

First of all he is white and uses the n-word a lot especially when we are with his family. I don't think he means it in a harmful way towards black people but still I cringe every time he says it, cause I feel like it is wrong for us to use it and especially so casually. I just don't know how to bring it up when we're alone and how to confront about it without calling him racist. 

Another thing is how he has been with other girls when we are out and drinking. He is always touching some other girl (on the back or shoulders) and to me it just seems unnecessary. Like I understand that he is more social and likes to interact with people and be friendly, but the touching really makes me uncomfortable. I would only touch a guy like that if I was flirting and that is what I feel like he is doing.. flirting.. This is something I did mention to him one night when he was being extra flirty with a girl and I just had enough of it cause I felt like it was embarrassing for me as his partner to sit while he was constantly fishing for another girl's attention.

 He has promised to not act like that again and says that since I'm his first partner he doesn't know where the boundaries are at. But I really can't seem to let it go this time, it's like I don't trust him the way I used to do. 

Our sex life is also getting worse, cause lately I just don't have the desire for it. I'm still attracted to him but I just can't relax when we have sex. I'm also lying about getting orgasms cause he always ask about it and wants me to say when I get one, so I'm stressed about trying to orgasm instead of just being natural and just being in the moment... 

I know that we're over the honeymoon fase and sometimes we will disagree on things, but I shouldn't go around being annoyed and frustrated and worry about how he interact around other girls.

"How do I give green light to be approached (according to the western expectations)? I (20F) come from a more conservative country and am used to guys being aggressive and insistent in their approach to dating and girls dressing nice, taking care of their appearance and waiting to be chosen. Therefore I still struggle to adapt to the western dating style. 

I've been told by my friends that guys rarely approach me because I don't signal to them in any way that I want to be approached. Now, first of all, that presents a logical fallacy: if I signal interest to a guy and he takes the bait, doesn't that mean he approaches me because he thinks I am interested in him and therefore am an easy target rather than HIM BEING INTERESTED IN ME? I mean, I would want a guy to approach me bc he thinks I'm beautiful, not because my interest strokes his ego. That's just humiliating for a woman. 

Second of all, how do I do that, like technically. I'm not talking about randos on the street; but, apparently, here, acquaintances, guys from the same college etc. when they engage with you at a party or in any other social gathering they expect YOU to indicate an interest in them before making their intentions clear. Then a) when a guy starts talking to me how tf do I differentiate between a guy who is gauging my interest and a guy who is just making conversation in a friendly way? And b) how can I signal to a guy I am available to be pursued without sounding too eager and making a fool out of myself?

There is a guy that in the past six months, I‚Äôve probably seen approximately 4 to 5 times also at this coffee shop. He also happens to be in one of my favorite bands (fairly big boy band). I‚Äôve always thought he was super cute, but never bothered him at the coffee shop since he was usually just popping in and out and I was there working on my computer. Last weekend I went out to a club with a couple friends, and he was there. He approached me, and we were talking and flirting and really hit it off. My friends wanted to go to a different club so we exchanged numbers and have been texting ever since. He didn‚Äôt recognize me from the coffee shop and I never mentioned having seen him there a bunch cuz it felt creepy?

It‚Äôs a whole turn off and mood ruined for me when they mention exes(ex.. oh you think you can be friends with exes- one guy asked, another one mentioned his ex used to like this one place on our date at a restaurant, another guy spoke about a professor from by league canceling their date last minute and his ex was a professor too ? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ). I thought it‚Äôs  a sign for me to not date now or use dating apps? Or my energy is attracting these types of guys? I just don‚Äôt get it but I end up feeling like shit and not good enough and like those exes are better than me.

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that? I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

"Narc ex (21M) begged me (21M) for another chance but then left me to be friends with benefits with someone else, what? Two weeks ago I left my narc ex because he was a horrible human being, I‚Äôll make a short list  
\- Slept with someone else the same day we broke up (multiple times)  
\- Made out with a 14 year old (he is 20)  
\- He supports school sh\*\*ters and terr\*rism  
\- Mysoginist and red p\*ll  
\- Objectifies people for sex  
\- Anger issues  
\- Wanted to k\*ll his ex girlfriend  
\- Cheated on me once a week (not always physical)  
\- Tired to break up with me once a week (we always talk it out)  
\- Everytime he tries to break up with me, he talks to other 10 people  
\- Slept with pr\*stit\*tes   
\- Emotionally and verbally abused me  
\- Stingy as hell  
\- Will leave you at the side of the road at night if you make him angry  
\- knew I was a virgin and was willing to wait but when e realized he had to get tested before we get intimate he changed his mind (he still did it in the end with a lot of convincing)  
\- Said he was willing to wait for me to be ready but kept pressuring me through break ups  
\- I always planned the dates  
\- Etc  
So basically I break up with him and block him permanently, a week later he manages to contact me begging me for another chance, telling me he was depressed and was willing to put in the work, this had never happened so I believed him, fast forward to two days later, he says he changed his mind because someone else who is ‚Äúsl\*ttier‚Äù than me, wanted to be friends with benefits with him‚Ä¶.   
I‚Äôm the only second person in his life he was/wanted to be in a relationship with and he knows he‚Äôll never find someone like me (that I have special) , but he chose to have sex with someone else instead of waiting for me, I gave him so much unconditional love but he chose to be selfish.  
I try to talk it out because I know he is disordered and impulsive, he manages to have a moment of clarity and agrees to get back with me but then he loses it and starts cussing me out telling me to leave him alone and he isn‚Äôt sure what he wants, I block him.  
How should I see all this? I am not jealous of the new guy because my ex told me himself I am better, he just chose him because of sex, but it still bothers me, how could he choose something so frivolous over genuine connection? And if I had given him my virginity, would he still be with me?",pixelthoughtz,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cr9q5/narc_ex_21m_begged_me_21m_for_another_chance_but/,1690634150.0,1.0

"Ghosting I (25 yr old male) got ghosted and I don't fully understand why.

We met on one of the popular dating apps. After we had a couple facetime sessions that went well, we decided to schedule an in person date at her apartment. We agreed that I would bring wine and my video game system and we would play video games and build a Lego set (probably a big mistake on my part), although she did have work the next day.

After driving down to her apartment to meet her, I immediately began to set up the game system, chatted with her a little, and eventually after a little struggle with set up, we finally started playing. We drank some wine, played some video games, and talked. We were struggling to keep a extend conversation due to the amount of things going on, and I decided to flirt with her a little and I kissed her. This was probably my biggest mistake as it was very quick and awkward. I did it because I wanted to show that I was still romantically interested. Looking back though, it was probably creepy and probably what really killed the vibe, along with the dying conversation.

I then proceeded to stay on her couch a little bit longer while I sobered up to drive home and eventually said my good byes, and left.  She did text me after I got back home to see if I was ok but it's been radio silent ever since.

This isn't the first date I've been ghosted (3rd)  at so I'm starting think the problem is me. What can I do to at least not be a weirdo and maybe get a second date, or even a response.

"Anyone else can‚Äôt stand the dating process? It feels like a waste of time some days. I just want to go back to when I felt safe and satisfied. I hate that beginning/ middle stage when you start to get attached but then they start to get ominous. Maybe because they think they have you already so they start to act differently. Then eventually the ghosts start to come out the closet. And you think to yourself‚Ä¶ ehhh I‚Äôm good. Thanks for your time but I‚Äôm out. But then it‚Äôs awkward because you‚Äôve spent so much time together and with each others friends. You‚Äôre close enough to give an explanation but not close enough to feel obligated to elaborate. 

Idk its that phase when you start to get nervous because you‚Äôre moving into a more serious relationship but now everything they do or don‚Äôt do you hold to a higher standard. You get nervous you‚Äôre about to get hurt emotionally. Past relationship fears start creeping in. You start to not trust them and question more things because you care more now. You see parts he‚Äôs secretive about and instead of being direct and blunt about asking why you decide its better not to know and just cut ties. So you just begin to slowly disappear. 

Then you wish you would have just stayed friends because they‚Äôre super great company and you get along so well.

"What's a dude gotta do to get a GF? I'm honestly at a loss, and no this is not a troll post.

Stats (listing these just to show, on paper, I *shouldn't* be undesirable):

25m

Bench 250 (just to show I'm fit)

Very high net worth (you'd never know by my lifestyle though)

100k salary (you'd never know by my job title)

Most people would agree I'm between a 6 and 8 out of 10 facially... most likely about 7.5 (aka pretty attractive but not a model or anything. Noticeably good-looking, though)

Really charismatic/funny but in a non-standard sort of way... like I'm very witty and intelligent and a bit quirky, kind of ""march to my own drum""

**The Problem:**

My job makes it so that socializing is tough. While I only work 30 hours per week, these hours are from 3am-9am, a.k.a. GL ever socializing with anyone with a traditional schedule because I sleep at 8PM. That, coupled with the fact I live in an area I know zero people, and I've pretty much consigned myself to only using online dating; I do go out on Saturday nights, but I don't really want to meet my future GF/Wife at a club. I'm not an anti-social person, either--in college I had a ton of friends--I just *can't* do that anymore.

Plus, a lot of my strong ""pull"" traits don't come across. Women like a guy financially set; while I am extremely set, my job title makes me seem poor. My living situation doesn't reflect my ""actual worth"" either, and I don't take fancy vacations or drive a luxury vehicle. I'm not interested in changing any of these things--outside of no dating life, my set-up is extremely ideal for what I want out of life. No stress, basically work part-time, pension after 20 years, and my investments will grow to some pretty massive numbers to create generational wealth by time I'm old.

But on online dating, while I do get a lot of matches, these girls just invest zero time in getting to know me. The only ones who do invest time getting to know me are, and I'm not trying to be a dick, but ones who just aren't in my league whatsoever. Like, again, not being a dick, but... I'm fit, attractive, make 6 figures, wealthy, and intelligent--I don't have much in common with a fat girl with tattoos all over her body and no job. There's also girls who just want a quick smash--I've had sex with two girls the last two months, and they weren't ugly, but that also wasn't ""dating"" whatsoever. 

So, how the hell do you actually date? I had a GF in college, but post-college it seems impossible. I don't meet enough women. I feel like the normal advice is something akin to ""level up,"" but really, I feel like I'm at the point of diminishing returns there.

"I (27f) can‚Äôt tell if my partner (33m) is love bombing me or is actually into me 
TLDR; 3 month relationship, not sure if this is moving too fast, jump down to examples for context

I have been talking with therapists and they seem to agree that I have an anxious avoidant attachment style that I‚Äôm actively working on healing and was told it may take at least a year being with someone to actually feel safe in a relationship. One of my therapist and I talked today about insecure vs. secure attachment and I brought up love bombing and how I have had relationships in the past that were heavy love bombing in the beginning and very intense but tumultuous and short lived (ended around the 2 month mark every-time).

I‚Äôm currently in a newer relationship after my last one that was 4 years. We are just coming up on 3 months with a month and a half of dates/talking prior to making this exclusive. My partner (33m) is very sweet. He is kind and attentive, honest, and also honors my ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù and gives space when needed. We send a few texts during the day to just check in but see each other every weekend and our communication and comprehension is amazing. He has also told me he goes by a motto that if he‚Äôs going to spoil himself then he wants to spoil his partner as well. Honestly I have never been treated in a more loving way, even when we have disagreements- I love it but it feels scary to me because history has always started out feeling good before the mask falls down when I finally get settled into the relationship. 

My therapist sent me a link I requested to a website on what exactly love bombing is and I‚Äôm confused on what is appropriate at this point.

Examples:

-prior to us being exclusive when going on dates he did insist on paying for a lot of the dates but didn‚Äôt argue when I said I wanted to pay or split the bill

-conversations did not start out emotional/deep but slowly got deeper as time went on

-prior to exclusivity he got me a t-shirt and handmade glass cup I said I liked when we were out on a date. He had offered to get me more but I told him no, that was too much. He gave no push back.

Since the exclusive talk: 

-he has got me a dress, 2 handmade bracelets, and cleared my smaller wishlist on a cheap clothing site I‚Äôve been using as I‚Äôm losing weight 

-my car got broken into at his apartment complex and he called out of work to spend the day with me to make sure I was okay and got home okay after talking with the police

-my car was also towed from his apartment another time because I parked in the wrong spot due to no available parking in visitors and he insisted he cover the bill for me

-he sent me money to order out food for us to have a dishes free date night and told me whatever was left I could keep. I told him no I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and instead got us dinner with the money then used it to buy him groceries since he works 2 jobs 6am-10pm Monday-Friday and doesn‚Äôt have time or energy to go to the store. He never had food at his place so I stocked him up. He told me to keep the remaining for gas, time, and effort

-we do say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to one another already. The first time it was even brought up- we were drinking and talking about our past selves- he had indirectly said it (said he felt very strongly and gave me a look) and I said I didn‚Äôt want to say it yet because it felt too early but I understood what he was saying, a week later we were getting off the phone and he said it by accident and apologized but we have started saying it more often and open

-we FaceTime to sleep every night for the last month

-my mom and sister came to town and I told him we were going to go see a movie he and I had talked about seeing together but mom hadn‚Äôt purchased the tickets yet and he got them for us as well as got himself one. I had said I thought it was too early to meet parents but it actually went really good for a movie day (he just said hello and chatted here and there before parting ways right after). It impressed my mom and sister for sure. I have not met his yet and told him I do not want to meet them until around 8 months, he agrees this is a good idea 

-he tells me at least once a week how great he thinks I am and how much he admires me and goes into detail every time 

-he doesn‚Äôt try to control me/what I wear except on 2 occasions where I was going out in a short romper and the angle he was sitting at let him see too much leg/butt- he said it was fine after he realized it was longer than what he saw at that angle and the other day when I was wearing a sports bra and shorts while FaceTiming him and I guess too much cleavage was showing and I was going to step out on my balcony to bring my cat in

I feel like he‚Äôs a keeper. It feels good and easy being with him, and I don‚Äôt feel weird about any of it until I start comparing or reading into it which is Normal I guess as I deal with anxiety. But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs all appropriate at this early stage.

"How do I break up with my boyfriend peacefully? I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 years, but I don‚Äôt feel anything for our relationship anymore. 

He‚Äôs becoming a bum to me and even though I‚Äôve tried everything to make our relationship spark again I just can‚Äôt. We started dating before COVID hit and when it did we didn‚Äôt have much to do, so I would accept going to his house often. A few months after we got together he got cancer and fought it for about a year, and because of that we couldn‚Äôt go out or do anything because he could‚Äôve gotten really sick and we just didn‚Äôt want to risk it. 

Well, fast forward to about a year ago he wasn‚Äôt working. His cancer wasn‚Äôt really bad (we caught it before it had a chance to take over) so his healing was quick. This is when I started to think about the future of our relationship. He was not doing anythingggg. He wasn‚Äôt working, wasn‚Äôt going to school (I was finishing up my bachelors at the time) he would be playing on his PlayStation, would go out with his friends late at night, buy expensive parts for his car, but didn‚Äôt have a single dollar whenever we went out, couldn‚Äôt even buy me a coffee or pick some flowers from down the block because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time or money for that‚Äù. 

I hate how he would use his cancer as an excuse and that ‚Äúhe was healing‚Äù I won‚Äôt lie, it did make me feel bad and felt like I was being to harsh, but in reality I was trying everything for us, I would drive, I would buy our food and outings, I would buy him stuff and it got to a point where I thought I should just date myself. 

Anyway, he finally got a part-time job, and signed up for community college. I graduated from college and am looking for a job in my career. I started to think about our future and to be honest I see nothing, but then I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish and maybe he‚Äôll change. 

Should I leave him? If I do, how do I tell him? He‚Äôs very dramatic and cries every time I mention a break or break up between us, which just makes me feel bad and say never mind, but I‚Äôm tired of this. Will he change? Or is this just all an act?

Edit: Sorry if I sounded entitled that is not what I was trying to portray. Yes, cancer is horrible and I understand that what he went through no matter how big or small it was, it was bad for him, his health and his life. We‚Äôve talked about that before. I wrote this in a moment where I was contemplating to break up with him because of exactly what everyone is telling me here I guess I am an asshole for leaving him. I always treated him respectfully, I‚Äôve given him space time and all the above to make him feel cared and loved before, during and after his cancer. But I, on the other hand, don‚Äôt feel the same. Once he was all better I would ask him to accompany me to my events at school, parties, clubbing, family events and he never wanted or wants to. Which is where I think it‚Äôs unfair because how come I was there for it all? How much longer do I have to be the ‚Äúgirl who stayed loyal to him because he was ill‚Äù person?

"How do you think rationally / know when to pump the brakes when a potential relationship is going really well? Hello! I am pleased to be asking such a question! Background: I (25M) have been texting a girl (24F) for about 6 weeks and we started going on dates 3 weeks ago. I met her at a party I hosted through a mutual friend and we hit it off really well, she asked for my number, and we started chatting. I usually am quite analytical and calculated, but this time things feel very different. We both immediately felt a good chemistry, can talk for hours, enjoy each other's company, text / call often, etc. The sex is also incredible and includes lots of laughter and comfortable communication. 

We both have acknowledged that we want to date, and she's even said ""tell me when you're ready, because I want to be with you"". This is really sweet and I would even go as far to say that she could be the one. We have similar life / family goals, similar humors, share similar careers, and just vibe really well together. I have told her that I want us to really flesh out the details of a relationship before being official and she thinks that's wise. 

That being said, I have two questions really:

1. How do you personally determine if someone is really the one / would be a great partner without letting yourself get too excited?
2. What goals would you like to achieve before officially dating? (I.e. convos about the future? Hanging with friends first?) 

Bottom line: I really like this girl, she really likes me and I have really good feelings about the potential here but I don't want to put the cart before the horse and ruin a potentially healthy, satisfying relationship.

"Is it weird that I‚Äôm uncomfortabel with my Bf en Bestfriend texting. So I‚Äôve been dating my Boyfriend for 4 Months now and he is the first guy I actually introduced to my friends. After dating for 2 months I thought it would be fun to invite my bestfriend to go out with us. They instantly clicked and there was no awkwardness whatsoever. My bestfriend is always someone who gets along fast with people, she is a really social and confident girl. Me on the contrary am really socialy anxious and not as confident as her. There been situations where I was interested in a boy but ended up finding out they liked her instead. I always tried my best not to get jealous of her but I‚Äôm still a human and things happen. But I do really love her she is such an amazing person and just like a sister to me. So anways I used her phone once to call my bf because my phone died, after that sometimes if I don‚Äôt answer my phone he would text her instead because we always togheter. But today I saw that they also have eachother on snap and also text there. Not a big deal ofcourse because I know my bestfriend and she would never do something to me but Its kind of weird knowing they are texting because I do know that my bf obviously thinks she is hot. All his friends already talked about how hot she is in front of me. I know that she is in his Private story but that really doesn‚Äôt matter because he only post meme‚Äôs, the thing I really hope is that he is not in her private story because she post alot of thirst traps on in it and really sexy pictures and it would be really weird if my boyfriend sees that. I wanted to ask her if he is in her private story but didn‚Äôt wanted to come across as suspicious towards her. I actually know for a fact if I would text his bestfriend on snap that he would freak out and say that Its really weird and all. I also know that if I would just tell my bestfriend I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the idea of them texting thats she would stop texting him and even delete him but I really don‚Äôt want to come of as this jealous controling girlriend because it‚Äôs not really like they‚Äôre texting in a flirty way its more joking about things and stuff like that.

"Discussed Exclusivity and Nothing Changed?? (M24) (F25) Hi,

I‚Äôm a little lost in my current relationship and would love advice. I‚Äôve been dating a woman for several months and the dates have been wonderful. She has initiated several, and finally we discussed exclusively seeing each other at the end of our last date. She said yes, but her behavior makes me question myself.

She never initiates conversation about how I am. I see her online, but I don‚Äôt seem to be a priority.  She never continues conversations, and if she doesn‚Äôt like a question I ask her she won‚Äôt answer at all. 

I don‚Äôt know if I see the label of boyfriend/girlfriend to mean something different from her? I know I‚Äôve only been seeing this lady for a couple months, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that a woman that is interested in a man romantically would like to see or talk with him more than once a week? Or at the very least check in on him?

Because I heard he is seeing another girl..she is in his team

Don't we have relation with our parents, children,spouse,friends, neighbours , colleagues?
The current generation or generation z as we call them have become so casual about relationships.
It's very important that we realize that superficial does not last long
We should maintain a certain level of respect for all relationship

"How to deal with wanting a relationship, but knowing you want to stay single Might be antithetical to this sub reddiy, but i figure if anywhere has good dating mentality advice it would be here.

24m, I have never been in a relationship. That is something I have wanted for probably a decade and a half you know, but no one is attracted to me, this is a big source of insecurity for me. I'll see a pretty girl in public, then just get so down and hateful of myself, it hurts a lot. I know realistically I could improve myself to a point where people might start liking me physically, socially, emotionally and financially, but I think by the time I am good enough I would be like 29, which is far to late to start dating you know. I know I am still 'young' and can learn, but the threshold I feel I would need is so far past where I am. By the time I am good enough, all of my peers would be very far past me. 

I realized last year also, that I value my independence so much. I have the freedom of disappearing to go camping for a weekend, I can spend the whole weekend just reading if I want to etc. 

 I logically I know I would prefer to stay single, I value my independence, and i know how much risk there can be in dating, but emotionally it still hurts, it hurts to be unwanted. I have a great career, I have hobbies I love so fucking much, I  don't mean to sound arrogant, but I have a lot going for me personally, but even with this the insecurity of feeling ugly and unwanted can kill me at times, halt my progress for days, sometimes weeks at a time.

I know I cannot get rid of the human desire to want to love and feel loved, but I was wondering if anyone had ways to mitigate that, and all of the insecurity and self loath that comes with it. I want to be able to go out without hating myself you know.

Also just a quick note, this is not to say I have given up on improving myself. I will still improve myself, I still study for my job and for personal joy, I will still lift, I will still try to improve socially etc, I just want to do this with the thought of wanting a relationship under control.",Stock_Accountant6356,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cgd91/how_to_deal_with_wanting_a_relationship_but/,1690597238.0,1.0

"The contact seems a bit getting distant suddenly (or am I just overthinking?) Hi guys!

I got a thingy here;

3 weeks ago I \[29F\] met a guy through Twitch. \[30M\]  (I stream also, so common interest) I randomly joined his stream one day, I thought he was very good looking. I added him on instragram, but with no intention (yet).

That same night he saw that I was still online quite late, so he started the conversation through instagram DM asking me what I was doing still awake so late. Since then the contact was quite 'intense' but very open and very nice.At some point I asked his number, so we could continue our conversation on Whatsapp. It was still very intense contact, and very open to eacheahtorer. He told me I seem very fun, bubbly open person, and he liked that. It felt very natural, and he didn't had that feeling before with someone he met through twitch for example.

He told me he was very curious about me, and he wanted to get into a Discord call alone with him, and game together.

The first appointment we made I cancelled because I felt ill, he said he was really looking forward to it, so he was bummed we didn't had that call that day.But we called the next day. Was very fun, open, easy and outgoing call, velt very natural and fun like we know each other for years.

After that call finished he told me he even was a bit nervous for our first call together, thought that was kinda cute. He really was curious about me, and wanted to see me in real life. I also wanted the same.

So after.. think about 2 weeks we met up, I traveled to his place.   (1 hour and 30 on public transportation)|I already told him on beforehand, that I only meet with guys up, if there's at least some potential to get something serious out of it. (I'm just done with al the FWB, and one night stands) and he agreed, and has the same.

I was at his place, it felt very natural, like I've known him for quite a while.Since he picked me up we didn't stop talking.And I even stayed at his place. Yes, we did has sex, normally I would wait for that, but since we don't really live that close to each other and it felt okay I was like f\*ck it.

After that date, I went home, and I texted him, how he was thinking about all this and he just want to see where it goes or is this just it.He told me he really liked it, and wanted just to see where this goes.Okay great you would think!

The contact through whatsapp still kinda stayed the same, on beforehand when he was for example live-streaming, in between the stream he would send me small texts like to ask what I'm doing etc. Or when he was finished, asking me if I'm still awake.

Last few times I wasn't awake, so I didn't react to that. Because I wasn't planning to stay awake every time. (he livestreames till 2:00 am, and I wanted to get my bedtime routine back to normal)

Since then I've noticed he isn't like really texting me that frequently anymore. I don't know if it's because he probably thinks im not awake anymore, but ive noticed he isn't texting like he used to while he was live-streaming. Like almost nothing anymore.

For example, yesterday in the midday we played Fortnite together for like 4 hours, but after that I didn't got any text anymore, not the full day and even after his stream.

Is it because he thinks im probably not awake anymore or is het just kinda losing interest? I don't anymore. I know im a really good over thinker.

Do you guys have some advice or tips perhaps? What should I do? Maybe let it depend on him now and not texting him anymore or? I really have the urge if he for example didn't texted me by tomorrow to ask if there's something wrong maybe, but that's perhaps not the best thing to do..

Really would love some advice here or tips on what to do. ",MariekePiekee,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cjcn6/the_contact_seems_a_bit_getting_distant_suddenly/,1690606737.0,1.0

"Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl Can't get it up with this SPECIFIC girl

So, to sum it up, I can't get hard with this girl. She makes me anxious and when I'm with her sex is in my head all the time... Other factor is that she is way more experienced than me and she talks about sex with no taboos at all, this is very new to me and makes me compare to this other experiences she have had.

On the other hand, I'm seeing this other girl at the same time that attracts me way less than the first one and I can have sex with her just fine. I know this means something, but I'm starting to really like this first one (maybe I'm in love?) and this whole situation is making me very anxious and uncomfortable. I really want to get my erections back. What do I do? It's driving me nuts! 

I know I probably should treat this anxiety I have with her, but it's totally sex related. We've already tried to have sex more than 5 times and could only once for just a few minutes, all the other attempts were failed and left me completely ashamed. I've already tried viagra but even that won't work with her. I need to get over this, it means a lot to me. We've talked and she said it's fine and I'm trying to assure her everything will be okay but as of now im starting to think maybe I should just brake up with her, which I don't want to do.

"Guy asked me to hang out and didnt reply to me when the day came. What went wrong? I 21F saw a post in a group from this guy asking a few days ago if anyone was going to the upcoming music festival, I messaged him and said I was and he told me that him and his friend 23M are going and want someone to come with them, they told me that they had an apartment in the city we'd be staying in and that accommodation wasn't a problem. I told him that I too had an apartment of my own there so I wouldn't be staying at their place. He was fine with it and invited me to go to the beach with them and said we could all ride in his car, I told him i already have a ride and cant go into random dude's cars, he said they totally respect that and it was just casual convo until he asked me how much would i rate him 1-10. That was random but it kinda started getting sexual which I wasn't comfy with, he laughed and said its okay and that my boundries were great. He asked me to meet up today just to meet each other since we are going to the festival which is in 3 days, and i said sure, he then was like ""this is my first date with a ginger girl"" and i corrected him saying we're just hanging out to meet each other before going to a festival, he was like yess you are right. It was a very flowy and good conversation and he never attempted to actually break my boundries, just tested what i was comfortable with.  
  
Well, that was a few days ago, this was the day we were supposed to hang out since he mentioned it a couple of times, he told me then that he'd text me today the plan where and when we were going and I already planned my outfit and makeup and everything. I waited and waited, nothing came up.  
  
I respect people's space and I am not a pushy person whatsoever, but I sent him a ""hey, we going tonight?"" to which i didnt get a reply to. I saw him post a story with his friend that they have packed for the festival. Like, they wanted me to go with them and ghosted me after I said yeah? This really weirded me out, i just dont understand what went wrong.  
  
Why did he lead me on? Did i do something? I thought I'd have friends to go to the festival with but now i cant even go, cause I'll be alone. His posts in the group were also very needy-like, the guy himself told me they would like a girl to come with them cause ""two dudes dont look that good together""  
  
What was their actual intention? The dude was very nice to me, i didnt get bad vibes off of him but I still would like some feedback, thank you reddit! :)

Like wouldn‚Äôt this be so fucked up if it were true??",Zealousideal-Face611,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cj4za/dating_apps_rigged/,1690606018.0,1.0
"When I put ""looking for relationship"" on dating apps I have different experiences. Opinions? I'm curious Hello! this is a throwaway account but anyway, I'm looking for opinions and experiences to understand a phenomena. I would like to see men and women points. I'm completely aware that what I'm sharing has my personal biases and also my ego manifesting.

To give you some context, I have no issues ""getting"" women offline, mostly on bars and clubs, but online things are a bit different. Offline usually I hook up with younger attractive women (let's say  (15,10) years younger than me) that are able to give me an immediate validation as a man either by sticking around or sometimes having sex right away.  Online I tend do attract some good looking women, usually closer to my age (I would say on average 5 years younger) and with most things happen in a pace I can feel the woman really desires me. Feeling desired as a man it is really important to me.

I'm actually looking for a relationship and realistically I would prefer a woman closer to my age, so  most of my real dating (not hookup) prospects come from dating apps.

The problem is that whenever I put that I'm looking for a relationship on apps, and this is not something I always do, I tend to attract some women that I think are a good fit but I often have the impression they treat me differently.

I started to realize that some of them, because they know I want a relationship, they change their behavior in order to look more ""relationship material"" (I hate social stereotypes but they still exist) and at the end they fail completely to fulfill my need to feel desired as a man by taking the physical things really slow. To me it looks like they are either more interested in the idea of a relationship than being with me or they are purposefully withholding sex to make me to invest even more but I can tell from conversations this is not their default sexual behavior (example: usually they sleep with a man much faster but now they want to take things slow) which I think it is very manipulative.

I'm thinking now that I can't just put ""looking for a relationship"" because whenever I do this thing will eventually happen. I happened to me to be in a relationship, much younger, that after a while I realized I was not truly desired but an emotional support only and I would not like to be in this situation again. 

I understand that dating should have no comparisons but many men assess women's genuine interest based on how (fast) physical things happen. I know many women might say when they really like a guy they want to make sure the connection is real but what many men hear is simply: ""this other guy is worth of sex without commitment but you are not"". And to clarify, I'm not comparing 1 date with 3 (small difference with many contributing factors to why things happened differently) but rather 2-3 months of difference in time where there were many dating opportunities and time to get physical.

My final conclusion is that is is better, in my case, to always start dating interactions saying ""I don't want anything serious"", because then I see the woman true behavior, and let it build from there.

Yes and I know men, even though a woman might say she wants something serious, they can still lead her on to get sex, which is a bad behavior. I'm not playing a hypocrite here but I'm curious about what men have to say. Women feel free to share thoughts as well.

"Beauty is not subjective I believe that beauty is not entirely subjective because certain aspects of aesthetics are universally appreciated across cultures and generations. While personal preferences may vary, there are fundamental elements of beauty that evoke a positive response in most people. For instance, symmetry, balance, and harmony are often regarded as aesthetically pleasing traits in art, nature, and even human faces. Additionally, certain natural landscapes, such as serene beaches or majestic mountains, consistently evoke a sense of wonder and admiration in people from different backgrounds.

My friend, when he asked her later, told me that she is open and might be interested. So I followed her on IG and messaged her... the timing though was horrible.. she was having her end of semester exams and planning on an internship abroad so she wasn't available online at all and was responding to messages so late.. until one day she sent me a vocal message apologizing for responding so late and clarifying the situation.  

I told her it's ok and that it's a shame.. we still talked a bit over messages on IG since me too I moved abroad, but to Germany ( she is in France ).

I plan to visit France when I get the chance and the idea of not getting that date her still lurks in the back of my mind, especially with the fact that she was actually interested.

Just fyi, I‚Äôm new to reddit and this is my first post. I am a 26M and have been in a dry spell with women for about 5 years now.

"How can i meet women and, most importantly, interest them ? Hi. I'm 25 and lonely. Physically i'm average, the real problem is that i'm awkard and kinda boring to talk to 

The thing is, i'm not a chatty guy, at least with people i don't know well. Back in school/collegue it took me several months each year before i spoke to classmates regularly. I improved a bit since then, but not by much. I can make some small talk to begin a conv, but people just get bored eventually. I just don't know how to make conversation or make myself interesting. I spend most of the time listening to others. How can i even meet and interest a woman in those conditions ? I feel like i'll go nowhere if i continue like this, but also that my attemps to change course are futile. 

Right now, i have a remote work job, so i stay home most of the time, and a dwindling social circle from old friends. 

I just went to a vacation where you're supposed to meet people (and hook up are common), and i can make small talk during meal just fine. But it stopped there, i haven't made friends. I don't drink and i don't have fun in the night-club setting, which i feel is a strong negative in those settings. I don't think it's just a case of ""you'll get used to it"", because i've been on similar vacations 3 times and to night clubs like 10 times: i wanted to force the change, but it refuses to come. On this point i'm not pitying myself i just think it's not for me.


Hobby wise, i go to the gym regularly and take drawing class. Also there, i can make small talk just fine, but that's about it. And these aren't really places for dating. I started salsa class recently (but so far it's the same story). 
I also tried cold approach a handful of times, and it stayed consistently akward, i made precisely 0 progress in hours, i'm not getting better at it. But when i can't make normal conv to begin with, this was expected, so i'm not surprise or sad about that. You can guess how well i did with dating apps... so i don't really meet women

To put the nail in the coffin, everytime i tried asking out or on date a girl i got rejected, like 7 or 8 times (+ during the cold attemps). I know those number aren't really high, but everytime i try it's a kick to my associal ass.

It‚Äôs been 4 years since my last relationship ended and since then I‚Äôve found myself in the above situations or situationships with men who have serious commitment issues. It‚Äôs making me feel like the men I find initially as good matches I‚Äôm not good enough for and the ones who find me really wonderful are not a good match for me. It‚Äôs starting to effect my self esteem and making my anxious attachment even worse because I want to seek reassurance that it‚Äôs going as well as I think it is. I‚Äôm often told I‚Äôm amazing and going to do wonderful things but they‚Äôre not interested in pushing further

Is a lack of spark a bullshit answer? Is it possible there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing in these guys or just missing in general? I‚Äôm at a loss for how to stop this cycle. Yes I‚Äôm in therapy and she has said I‚Äôm doing everything I can be. I‚Äôm just tired of these reoccurring scenarios.

"As a real Demisexual..... Dating apps are completely useless After a lot of therapy and working on myself and pointedly waiting to start trying to date again after my divorce. Dateing apps are completely useless. 

It's so weird for me. I am not attracted to physical features at all. If anything pictures are a complete turn off. I want to know what your dreams are, what your goals and aspirations are. Who is your favorite person, where do you want to be when you grow old. 

I find that, literally all men in the dating apps that I sometimes match with, are all looking for just that one thing. Don't get me wrong. When I finally grow attracted to someone I turn into a succubus that only can think about one thing. However if I am not attracted to you, it's like you have zero sexual identity on my radar. 

I use to be able to force myself to do casual encounters, but those were not anything fulfilling or memorable in the slightest. Now I just can't. The idea of casual anything makes me want to throw up.

Does anyone have any pointers on how to go about dating as a self aware and healing Demisexual? Borderline Asexual?

"I'm (27F) Torn (40M)&amp;(30M) I dropped dating apps for this very reason, and yet it happens again... 2 great men fall into my circle at the same time.

I went on a date with P(40M) two weeks after my very toxic relationship ended. When he asked me out I was very honest and let him know what I went through, and that I wasn't ready for a serious or commited relationship. He wanted to try the date anyway, and it turns out, we got along really well. So we decided to keep seeing each other for fun.

2 months in, and he seems really serious now. Mentioned moving in... being against kids, but would have them if it was with me... I realize now we've gone too deep, despite my constant reminders that I'm not ready to be seriously involved.

In the meantime, about 1.5 months ago, I met M(30M) through a volleyball group. He was shy at first, so I didn't notice his interest, but now it's obvious. And honestly, I'd really like to date him too, just to get to know if he's a good partner or not. He does, however, belong to a religion that doesn't accept Atheists, and I know this will likely cause problems with his family.

I know I will have to have a conversation with P about this, and I plan on being fully transparent and honest. However, 1. He knows M, and 2. I could see P being a good life partner for me. I just haven't had time to get to know either well enough, but I feel P is so far along that it would seriously hurt him to hear this.

I'm not getting younger, and have never had a healthy or good relationship before P. I want to have children and be around for their grandkids, so it just ups the pressure to find the right partner right away. I don't want to lose the chance to be with either of them, but I know it's not right to not make a decision.

I know people who find themselves in these situations tend to be judged really harshly. It should be easy to just comit to one right away, right? I just wish it didn't have to be this way, and I just hope the right partner will be the person I chose in the end...

They keep going through up and down periods and when we were just friends i kept advising him to break things when he told me all the bad but he just wont do it. She pretty much thinks of him as a boyfriend but he doesn't see her that way.  
Now he's seeing us at the same time and it hurts that he was at her place last night (saw though her insta stories) and not with me. I feel lost and so alone. And while he was at her house part of the time he was texting me.

I was dating a girl I met on insta for 4-5 weeks, we went on 4 dates and kissed on the 4th date (I know it was late) and we‚Äôd speak daily on text. We arranged to meet again for a 5th date, but after agreeing she started to give me slow replies.

I ignored the message and went on with my life. But I‚Äôll be honest, I really liked her and saw things moving in the right direction. We both said we were only dating each other at the time. This was 10 days ago where she cut things off. 

We still follow each other on Instagram, but I will have moments throughout the day where I will think of her.

He always buys me clothes and its obviously old people clothes and gets mad when i dont wear them. theres a lovely old woman called angelina (fake name) shes 72 and she really likes him hes been working there since he was 16 and her family never visits so hes grown quote close with her and he always brushes her hair and buys her loads of things and he took her hairbrush home and goes absolutely mental when i touch it and takes it everywhere with him and it‚Äôs absolutely berserk. when he gets home from work hell call her andd talk to her for hours then go on the bathroom for about  1-2 hours everyday after work and then never wants to have sex but hell have sex with me on the weekend when he doesnt work i dont want to assume things but I think he‚Äôs touching himself to her or thinking about her while doing it I‚Äôm not sure and I just feel like either something is going on with oth them. it was her birthday and he literally spent nearly all of his wage on birthday presents for her and when it was my birthday he barely spent ¬£50 which is fine but why would you spend almost 1500 on an old woman And it‚Äôs just strange like he has things to pay and he‚Äôs spending his whole months wage woman and not on necessities.

"Coworker Situation So there‚Äôs a girl that I work with. She started a few months ago. I noticed her pretty quickly, she had the kind of eyes you could get lost in if you‚Äôre not careful. She works in a completely different department than me, but I technically have a more senior position in the company. 

A couple of weeks ago she came into my office.  Needed to review a document. She positioned herself at the side of my desk and knelt over to show me specifics on the document. I was immediately aware that if I wanted to I could see straight down her dress, but I‚Äôm not an asshole. I maintained professionalism. Then she stood up as if to leave, repositioned herself *directly the fuck in front of me* and bent wayyy over to continue explaining the document. Again, didn‚Äôt even think twice about maintaining professionalism. 

Fast forward a few days, she stopped by my office for another work related thing and mentioned that she broke her toe. I said ‚Äúoh no, that sucks‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúyeah, look‚Äù and she took her shoe off to show me how it had bruised and monologued for quite a while about how it happened. I‚Äôm in no way one of those feet weirdos, but it just felt so intimate for a work setting and with such limited interaction between us. 

So that happens, and that‚Äôs when I was like ‚Äúhey wait, what the fuck was that bending over my desk move? Was that on purpose?‚Äù To myself. 

The only other real interaction since then was when I had to call her for clarification and she answered the phone with ‚Äúhey darling.‚Äù Which was a super weird superlative to use if you‚Äôre trying to drop a hint. 

So what do I do here? It seems entirely plausible that I‚Äôm completely misreading the situation, and I recognize the my own vulnerability in that I noticed her first. She‚Äôs definitely extremely outgoing, which is the opposite of me, so I might be mistaking common niceties and social mishaps for advancements and I‚Äôm not about to risk my professional reputation on a slim chance. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, we‚Äôre both mid 30s. She‚Äôs a little older and divorced. I‚Äôm just habitually single.

"Something happened and I feel like I don‚Äôt want to see her again. Am I being ridiculous? Hey! 

I‚Äôve [M27] been dating this girl [F23] for almost two months now. I work full time in a hospital and because of university she only works part time at a bar but only like 2-3 days a weeks at most.

Anyway we had some issues but always talked about them. But at this point I‚Äôm sure she will say anything just so I don‚Äôt break up with her. But I think today something broke in me and I don‚Äôt feel so good about her anymore. 

I‚Äôve been working for 2 weeks almost every day. 12 hour shifts and the only free time I had was the afternoon/evening after night shift sleep. On top of that I had very bad shifts, acute cases. We lost young patients and stuff like this sometimes wears you down. So yesterday I have a shift, I‚Äôm ending at 6 pm. We didn‚Äôt agree to see each other that day. She texts me out of blue she‚Äôs sleeping over at my place. So I‚Äôm like okay but I‚Äôll be tired and I planned on just taking a shower, eating something and sleep but we can watch a movie. I just really need to chill out in bed. I explain to her how draining the last two weeks were on me and that I need to chill out. She‚Äôs a future nurse so I tell her how we had some very bad cases that got to me like kids with serious conditions. So she‚Äôs like cool we can do that together. Then she comes over and it takes like an hour so before she starts talking about how we should go out in town because there‚Äôs some event going on and we should go grab ice cream. I keep telling her that we agreed to go Saturday (the event goes on whole weekend) and that I just want to relax a bit tonight. But she keeps asking me to go out with her. So I tell her I would totally understand if she went or in the future if I say I need to relax and she doesn‚Äôt feel like doing that with me we can just meet the next day it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Anyway we stay home, watch movie, get a glass of wine etc. 

So next day which was today morning we talk about my schedule. I tell her we had lots of sick personnel but after Sunday my schedule is all great for August. But I will need Monday and Tuesday. Monday to clean up the apartment, sheets, clothes, floors, windows etc. and Tuesday just for me to do a bit of mental hygiene. But after that we already have plans for trips etc. of course she goes off at me, starts bringing up that I didn‚Äôt even go out with her last night. And this really got to me because I tried my best explain that I‚Äôm exhausted and I would understand if she didn‚Äôt come over and we‚Äôd meet the next day. 

On top of this she‚Äôs mad because my ex gf from like 3 years ago asked me for help. We remained friends but we‚Äôd only talk like once every 6 months over messages. She keeps losing memory for hours and fainting randomly. Doctors are giving her appointments in December and she can‚Äôt pay for earlier ones. So all I did was text her back saying ok I‚Äôll try something. And talked to friend who‚Äôs a neurologist and will check her out. I explained to my gf that from experience I know this could even be a brain tumor and I‚Äôm not even talking to her about anything other than when she should visit the neurologist friend. But she‚Äôs mad about this and keeps bringing it up. And for me it just feels so cold. Like the girl could have something serious and she did help me when Ukraine war started. So why should I not return the favor at least. 

Anyway after all this she apologized over text saying she needs to get used to my schedule and how I work. 

But since then I felt kinda cold towards her. I really dread seeing her again. I don‚Äôt want to text her back.

"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

"Trouble after long term relationship My partner of three and half years recently left me. I thought she was the one. We have lived together for about three years and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never loved someone like I love her. We shared finances and we were planning our future together.

Things didn‚Äôt end with resentment or nastiness but I am still devastated to say the least. We still love each other but she feels that she needs to take the next chapter in her life alone so she can figure some things out. I still have trouble processing this some days and other days I feel like I can see the silver lining.

My previous relationships before her were long term as well. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for anything serious but I think if I were to get back out there and start talking to other people it might help me heal and cope with the loss and major life change. My only issue is that I honestly don‚Äôt even know where to begin. 

I‚Äôve heard horror stories about dating apps but I‚Äôve been considering downloading something to at least meet new people. I just don‚Äôt know which would be best for my situation. I‚Äôm not ready for anything serious at all. I want to ease into it. Not necessarily looking for hookups but I‚Äôd be open to it if I get to know someone well enough and the vibes are right.

"Should I wait till I get it all in place or what? Should I wait to get all of the things I need in place, Going back to school, Learning to drive etc to be able to go out and try to find freinds and potention partners at 34? 

I'd like to have at least 2-3 Girlfriends before I turn 40, since I am actively trying to avoid the whole end up marrying your first partners that happen to a lot of late bloomers I have known or have observed happening through stories online.  And I don't want to only get one person to date.

I know a guy who is a chubbier dude who is now married and has an adopted kid and he met her back when we were both like in our early 20's. 

I do not want any kids, and I never want to be married despite thinking of becoming catholic since I believe in Birth control, Abortion and condoms. I'm not going to go into WHY I am so far behind because that would basically be a book and I wrote a post telling the whole thing before. but it does have to do with Chaotic living situations and taking care of dying and much more disabled than I family members.

There's certain types of people I will never date despite the fact I'm supposed to be obligated to date them, or society says you have to be willing to, I'd rather be alone in that case. I am not attracted to my own race and even if I were 99% of the people that have the most in common with me are from outside my racial background anyways, so I'd end up dating more of those people anyway.

 I don't like curvy women with large breasts and big butts like certain types of models, I like modestly sized, women. 

I started a tinder profile despite not having a flattering photo, swiped nope on single moms because I am not interested in any kind of kids or family, plus i want to avoid sex with a woman who has given birth, nobody should lose their virginity to that and I don't want to hang out with kids or have someone who has someone other than me as their first priority except their parents.

I also swiped nope on black women because as I sadid before I am just not turned on by women of my own race, and I also automatically swiped nope on curvy women because large body parts don't appeal to me. 

Sydney sweeney is pretty as an example but her boobs are just too long and saggy. Somehow I like Mila Azul although her boobs are round but not long and saggy or flapjacks which I find to be gross and I would not have sex with a girl with ugly breasts. 

My ideal woman is an A-cup or a small be cup but i guess I can force myself to like bigger. 

I also expanded my age range from 18-22 to 18-29",RaymondLeggs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15cc9kj/should_i_wait_till_i_get_it_all_in_place_or_what/,1690585886.0,1.0
"Welp he finally told the truth I knew it but somehow I‚Äôm still devastated like I didn‚Äôt. Me and this guy started talking the beginning of this month. We had great conversations and were planning several dates. We had sex too soon and I can admit to this. It was great sex. But it was too soon. I hoped we could still continue to be cool with one another but he started to fall back. Texts got shorter his effort wasn‚Äôt there like mine. It got to the point that I was basically talking to my self and he was okay with it. I decided not to give up until he did. So everyday I tried talking to him. For a bit he played along. Last night I didn‚Äôt reach out anymore I was tired of feeling so rejected. That‚Äôs when he called me. We talked about a bunch of nothing but he kept hanging up telling me to hold on. Till finally he hung up told me to hold on then never ever called back. Today I reached out to see if I can get a response. I texted ‚Äúdtf‚Äù what do u know suddenly he was great at responding and said ya he was down. I  pointed this out to him. I think it triggered him. Because he got kinda mad as if I was wasting his time and stopped responding to me afterwards. Few hours go by and I finally say one last thing ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. He responds moments later ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not my type‚Äù 

It crushed me how he couldn‚Äôt keep it real all that time and let me embarrass myself for a week straight.

Now I have to heal all over again. 

Dating is really so pointless anymore people waste so much time trying to pretend that it‚Äôs really not even worth the struggle anymore.

"My crush likes by best friend So I met this guy (my crush) at college gym, he was always there when I went and we started sharing some glances, and sometimes he asked me if I was using some machines so I started thinking that we were flirting (cause I was).  The days passed by and I noticed that we had a friend in common, so I asked my friend if he was single and she told me that she wasn‚Äôt sure, but she was going to find out, so since that day I saw my friend and this guy closer, and we never talked about it again after that. I was still into him but trying not to make it obvious, until I saw him with a girl (he started dating some random girl ), I got so sad because I thought that I had a chance, but I never tried talking to him or getting closer cause I was so afraid of rejection.
Some days ago my best friend, let‚Äôs call her Lora told me that my crush told a friend that he thought Lora was 10/10, and if she had come into his life earlier, it would have been perfect, but he already had a girlfriend.

"Advice for Finding Someone as a Sober Introvert Hey folks, just gonna start by saying the default ""do more of what you like and you'll find someone"" advice isn't going to help here, cause what I like doing doesn't involve meeting new people (not that I hate meeting new people, my hobbies just don't encourage that).

For some context, I'm an introvert that recently started using dating apps to try to find someone cause I'm in a new city with no family nearby and I've been single for over 6 years, that makes life pretty lonely. I really hate using the dating apps because they make me feel judgy and wreck my self-esteem because I've not been having any success. I get likes pretty regularly, but they are almost exclusively from people I don't find attractive and on the few matches I do get the conversation goes nowhere and the one first date I went on went nowhere, no spark. I'm generally a pretty dry texter so I think I make pretty poor first impressions over text. I'm much more engaging in real life, so I need to find a way to use that.

I don't drink, so bars aren't an option, and I don't generally like going out to meet new people, but I know I have to if I want to start dating anyone. So my question is pretty simple, what can I start doing other than going to bars where asking someone out isn't frowned upon or weird? Again, the normal ""do what you like"" advice just doesn't make sense for me and I have no real hobbies that involve group interaction (with new people). I work with a lot of people my age but asking out coworkers feels really weird to me.

"How to best explain to my bf just how selfish he is as English is not my first language I‚Äôve (29/f) been dating my boyfriend (27/m) for 8 months now and I have been seriously thinking of breaking up with him. However, I do need help on what to tell him which led me to want to do this.

For context, he‚Äôs my first boyfriend and the past few months have made me see things clearly and I do not like what I‚Äôm seeing right now.

Out of the fights that we had, the worst one was the one we had when we went on holiday to see my favorite band in a music festival. He bought the tix after we had a previous fight as his way of making it up to me while I booked the hotel. 
When we arrived at the event, he got uncomfortable with the amount of people and kept on asking if we could go out and come back later when my favorite band is playing. He kept on doing this until I got pissed off and we went out of the concert grounds. I explained to him that the moment we went out, we won‚Äôt be able to go back to that spot as it is not a reserved place and that every minute, more people are getting in. He knew it was a big event with and estimated 45,000-50,000 people.
In the end, I didn‚Äôt get to watch the band I love and he got upset because I got upset. 

Also, I spent almost 1k gbp for everything (food, hotels) during the entire holiday where I spent half of the time crying while he gets to enjoy and go to his favorite spots.

After 3 weeks, we had an honest talk, aired out what made each of us feel hurt before making up.

Now, he stayed in my house for three days and used up all of my towels, toiletries and groceries while refusing to drive me to work because he‚Äôs tired. I did all the cooking and cleaning while he was at my place.  

I can see now how selfish and a parasite this man is and I would like to ask for help on how to tell him how selfish he is to me as English is not my first language. I want him to understand and feel just how he used me in those instances. He previously phoned me saying all mean things to and one of which is I was using him but it‚Äôs not true.

"Confusing stuff in my last year of college So I (24M) and in my final year of college (I started late due to military service), about to graduate in September actually. In a class during my final semester, I met A (21F) also on her last semester of college. We only started talking 7 weeks ago.

At first, it was casual, just friends in class talking. We eventually went out with some people in the class and after that I started to take an interest in her. I then asked her out for lunch, and it became a semi-regular thing which we would do every few days.

About 3 weeks ago, she went on a weekend trip to another city and asked to meet with me when she came back. Of course, I said yes and we met up at the train station where she came back from the trip. We ended up having a really nice dinner, took in nice views from an observatory, walked together for an hour, and just lost track of time. We missed the last train without even knowing it while we were at a park, just talking about life.

That night, we found a open field in a park to just lie on and talk, listen to music and enjoy each others' company. At one point, we were holding hands and saying how much we liked each other. We planned to head back once the first train came on, but we we continued just goofing around in the park 3 hours past the first train. I did eventually send her back to her place before heading back to mine. After that night we grew closer and closer with more frequent dates etc.

Recently her friends have been telling me to tell her how I feel etc etc and try to convince her to stay after graduation (she's not decided what she'll do after graduating, but she wants to apply for masters back in her home country in a program that will start next September). Another one of her friends even straight up told me that A likes me and told me to just go for it.

I myself, have been accepted into a masters program in the college I'm already about to graduate from, on a scholarship, so I'll definitely be staying here. I honestly don't mind doing long-distance as I've done so in the past and I know I am capable of doing well (the last long-term relationship I had was LDR and she ended up cheating on me when she got drunk and gave into temptation with a coworker she always found attractive blah blah).

This week, I've tried to ask A out for our regular lunches or just to meet up at a cafe, but she would always say she's busy etc. Even last time, when she was busy, she took the time to squeeze in 30min with me if she could, which I found to be really endearing and attractive. Furthermore, in the last weeks, we would text so much until 3am in the morning, but recently, she only texts very infrequently. I went to talk to a mutual friend about this, who's very close with A and she said that A likes me a lot, but the thing about distance is scaring her (Apparently the girls talk a LOT about guys they meet, who knew?). As a result, A has decided to distance herself from me, according to that friend, even though she has feelings.

I honestly don't know what to do because I respect her decision. If she doesn't want to start anything, nothing can be forced and life goes on. Just can't help but feel that this is right person, wrong timing, cuz I feel this could've developed into something special and long-term. It's the first time I'm in the scenario where my head and heart wants different things. Head is telling me if she wants to distance herself and not get into LDR, then don't force it on her. But heart wants to pursue it, even though my head says it won't be respectful to her decision of wanting to distance herself. I'm in a bind, can y'all give me any advice?

"I think my partner doesn't like me I (34f) is in a relationship with (42 male). Things started out great in the beginning. Even though we are long distance technically ( we live roughly 2 hours from each other), We were seeing each other almost every single weekend. He was doing everything great and the connection felt strong. We've been together for about 6 months now. He has never been inside of my home only to help me move. I never been to his but I have seen his house and his parents which is a couple of doors down from his. Now we will see each other once a month or twice a month. Before we would even meet halfway to a location, so we can see each other. He doesn't even initiate that anymore. Sometimes he says Things that make me think that he doesn't like me. Such as he won't say that he misses me or struggles to say what he likes about me. He'll even say things like, ""Oh I like you because no one else liked me"".  When I call him out about different things that he says he tries to clean it up so that it makes more sense. He has told me in the beginning of our relationship that But he usually says to women and relationships gets him in trouble and it's often miscommunication. A friend of his that actually put us together also mentioned that and said he hasnt dated much in his life and is very awkward in general. He doesn't want me to leave, but it honestly feels like a friendship. I told him before what my love languages are. And he was doing it in the beginning and he has stopped. I like to be reassured and have positive affirmations. And he makes excuses for it now for why he doesn't do it or says he is showing me by actions. Sometimes I feel like I was loved bombed and he just got super lazy. And then there are times where I feel I'm not fully understanding him because he doesn't know how to communicate properly. But honestly, I feel like it could be an excuse. Because he was expressive in the beginning and now hes not. He can feel when there's a shift with me and he will ask questions about it but there is not really any solution offered. I enjoy spending time with him and feel my needs are met in person, apart I do not. This has been communicated to him before. I thought about telling him that I don't want to be exclusive with him anymore because he confuses me. I feel like I am just a fun person to be around with him and fulfilling some sort of need for him.

"Social Anxiety with Girls, should I go to the psychologist? Hi community,

I'd like to have some advice from you. I'm a 26M that never had a relationship or sexual experience in my life, I'm an average looking guy, 165cm, skinny, I work and study, traveled a lot, definitely not too boring but maybe not being interesting enough and/or not showing interest in the correct way.

&amp;#x200B;

I always got along well with women, have a few real friends and this is nice. However, I a-l-w-a-y-s failed when trying to show interest to women and since I moved to a new country (all by myself and alone) a few months ago, everything is being much harder. I basically don't have any woman friend, just a couple male friends. My goal at this moment is to get a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been spending several hours of my life during the past years just watching PUA's videos and reading articles, posts, advices in general but I can't put it in practice. Although I know that approaching a girl in the street can be so easy and have awesome results, I have kind of a ""blocker"" in my mind that literally doesn't make me take the action to do that. I start getting nervous/anxious in a very high level just by looking at an interesting girl.

As an example: I met a girl a few days ago, we had some nice convos in the first day but I felt myself too nervous and most likely I was looking too desperate that she didn't talk to me the same way during the following days...

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to consider going to a psychologist because I'm so sad and disappointed with me that I'm unable to approach a girl or have a conversation without being anxious and looking desperate to pick up her. What do you think? I know that practicing maybe is the only solution for my case but the problem is that I am unable to put it in practice because of my f\*\*king mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating apps are also bullshit for me, never get matches or the ones I get don't answer me (and no I'm not the kind of guy who say just ""hi"")

In brief, I have 3 big problems problems to solve before even starting a relationship:

\- Social anxiety with women I find interesting

\- Showing interest the right way without looking desperate

\- Be interesting for women

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't say bullshits like ""oh you're too young, don't worry"", first no I'm not too young and second everybody who says such thing was able to have at least one experience, no matter if it was bad or good

"His boundaries are stricter than mine and he seems afraid to make progress At the beginning of the month I confessed my feelings to my crush (and friend of 2 years) and he returned the feelings. We‚Äôve had a discussion laying out the milestones we want to meet together before considering anything serious (it‚Äôs long distance). I told him there‚Äôs no rush on anything and he agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt rush through it. 

So far it seems like I‚Äôve been the one most responsible for sending messages and suggesting conversations and communication that serve to progress the relationship at what I believe is an appropriate pace. However, he‚Äôs giving me some signs that he feels uncomfortable taking the role of being the one to progress things while also showing that he wants to take things slower than I do. 

For example, I initiated a conversation about our boundaries around intimacy the other day and he seemed a little hesitant to speak up. At one point he asked if I was concerned about it hurting more if things between us fell apart and we had made things sexual. This is kind of concerning to me because I have been working on getting away from the mindset of worrying about how I‚Äôll feel in the future about things I‚Äôm doing in the present because I think it prevents me from living in the moment and is even a little self-sabotaging. Personally, I think it‚Äôs unhealthy (at least for myself) to try and look out for my future self because I figure I‚Äôm going to be hurt either way if things have to end. And if they end before we‚Äôve made things sexual, after we‚Äôve made things sexual, before we get serious, after we get serious, etc. Then to me it doesn‚Äôt really matter because I‚Äôll be hurt in that moment but I‚Äôll never know what the hurt would have been like had we or had we not progressed to a certain point. But it concerns me that he‚Äôs already considering his emotions when things end rather than putting that focus on intentionally building our relationship, whatever that might look like for him at this time. 

Additionally I‚Äôll make suggestions about things we can do to progress things (that are still baby steps!) and he seems very shy to accept or very gently rejects me. He‚Äôs also himself shared that he has a fear of rejection alongside his fears that I‚Äôve noticed about progressing things between us, I feel kind of lost. I don‚Äôt mind being the one progressing things but at a certain point I feel weird about continuously suggesting things knowing that he‚Äôs wanting to move slower or that my suggestions still aren‚Äôt in line with his boundaries in that moment. I don‚Äôt mind the rejection but at a certain point it makes me uncomfortable to continue bringing up these conversations and suggestions all on my own. But if I stop what I‚Äôm doing now I‚Äôm concerned that he isn‚Äôt comfortable trying to progress things even when he might be ready, so things will just slow down and come to a standstill.

When he cheated on me he unfollowed every girl for me and uninstalled every social media app when I found out to show he changed keep in mind I never told him to do this he  did it to show he changed. 

Later on he told me ‚Äú you know when I unfollowed every girl I was expecting you to do the same yknow like unfollow every guy‚Äù by this I was utterly confused? Was he doing that to just gain control of me did he really mean it. He used to tell me stuff like ‚Äú if I can‚Äôt have you no one can so I might as well just kill you‚Äù and proceed to call it a joke.

He gave me this thing called ‚Äúprogress‚Äù where I‚Äôll have to do certain things to get it up so I can be with him again.

He was even more mad and told me he never asked me to come back to make the long  story short towards the end he told me ‚Äú I hope one day you realize you lost the boy who really loved you go for a guy who only wants you for one thing‚Äù I was very hurt by this statement this might sound very immature but I sent him screenshots of what my friends said about him and my brother than I just blocked him .

And many others I can‚Äôt believe it I‚Äôm done with this bullshit‚Äù when I saw this I told him off and gave him a piece of my mind calling him a shitty person controlling told him his childhood isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a bad person etc he kept telling me to calm down but I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances and kept going he then said ‚Äú ok make sure you eat have a good day‚Äù and blocked me. I told my friend nick about the situation he knows I hurt I was nick got mad and told me to give him his username to tell him off I didn‚Äôt want too but somehow he managed to get it and he told him off cursing at him etc

 my ex told me to leave him alone multiple times but he told nick ‚Äú she blocked me I have her unblocked she can contact me anytime she needs help‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt planning to contact him again but that statement made me mad because it was a lie he had me unblocked I told him off saying how could you lie like that he told me well maybe instead of you insulting me calling me a narcissist and sneding me s screenshot of what your friends said  we would‚Äôve fixed this he ranted about how much he hates himself and how much of a monster 

he is bc of one of the screenshots he told me he tried taking s bunch of pills and almost killd himself which I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true wouldnt he be at the hospital ? And while driving he tried not to crash into a tree I felt awful and terrible and told him sorry and it‚Äôs all my fault his birthday was today and I sent him some stuff apologizing saying I was in the wrong etc my friend nick told me not to listen and he is just trying to manipulate me but I felt so bad and awful and wrote an apology to him he got mad and told me how dare I tell people about his trauma and how could I not defend his name when my friends were talking bad about me when he defended mine 

he told me I broke another promise because he wanted me to block this guy while we were dating and when he found out I unblocked him he got sad and said I  broke a promise by unblocking him even tho we are no longer together.

It is a long distance relationship we stay in different cities, i have moved out for my college about 2 years back. I met a girl here in my 1st year of my college. our vibes matched so quickly that we became bestfriend in no time. In recent past my when i and gf had a major fight, things got little physical with my girl bestie. My gf found out and the fight became worse but later she forgive me.  Everything was going nice between my gf and i . my girl bestie also got an bf but later they broke up. And after some recent developments i figured out im Physically attracted to my girl bestie and the problem is she's LITERALLY obsessed with me as well so she never say NO to me for anything. On the other hand with my gf its going super Swift as well, we recently hit the 3rd base. What should i do in this scenario. Im confused.

"To early for that? So I have been dating this girl we have been going for like 2 and half weeks, we had a few dates, we slept at my house a couple times and all in all we are having great fun and enjoying each other. The thing is I'm going to give some context about my self and her before asking. Since I started working and studying, and now just working I have pretty much left my ""crazy life"" behind, meaning I don't really have the energy to go out and party and being in a an environment full of people, I prefer to go with my close group of friends have a beer smoke one talk and chill. She on the other hand is quite a sociable person likes to party quite frequently at least 1/2 a week all in all that's not really a problem for me. Once I get to know and like someone I like to devote my attention to that person and I don't get romantically interested in anyone else, and I like someone that has the same mindset. The thing here is because she was way more of a sociable life I'm a bit insecure because I don't really know yet her intentions with us and if she is interested in being exclusive I would like to ask but I'm afraid that it's to early for that can someone help me with some advice?  
I can't really read people intentions it's hard for me so I don't know if we are just having fun and that's it or maybe it could be something more

"Am I the only one who thinks this stuff is stupid and hypocritical? Sorry I  personally think that guys need to stop acting like woman need to be these prudes that like hate sex until they get with them. Like woman will say a loot if things and sometimes mean the opposite but . Men have been pulling this On my way! For a while , you can‚Äôt want a girl who is sweet and has like no bodies but want her to be like trans trump in the bedroom that‚Äôs not how that works bro. And just the stigma that girls get for exploring their sexuality nowadays is just wow  if you make it do any type of sexual content your a lost cause and not wanted. If your a guy with like hella bodies your that guy tho shits so stupid. It‚Äôs even more wild to me that I see this sentiment from a lot of guys but then guys who think like that will turn around and hate on people like Kevin Samuels . Even Andre tate doesn‚Äôt think like that and he‚Äôs said some wild stuff. Not saying everyone‚Äôs the same but I think stigmatizing sex work in general nowadays especially for woman is just beyond stupid.

"I feel so weird going from being insecure to desirable within the dating scene I‚Äôm a 22 year old male, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, average/husky build, and a pretty average looking guy (at least to me). 

I‚Äôve been insecure my whole life. No one ever told me I was ugly or made fun of my looks or anything, I‚Äôd just constantly compare myself to other guys and get in my head tbh. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship because I always thought I was undesirable and feared ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù rejection. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I turned 21 last year lol. My insecurities deprived me of so many experiences. 

I lost my virginity on my birthday vacation, and since then I‚Äôve had a MAJOR boost in confidence. I started taking pictures more, been more outgoing, and just overall more confident in my skin, but not fully. 

I recently made a few dating app profiles, and my God, the amount of likes and matches I‚Äôve gotten is insane. I‚Äôm talking 200+ likes within a 2 weeks and an average of 2-4 matches a day. I never thought I‚Äôd be ‚Äúthat guy,‚Äù it honestly feels weird. I‚Äôve had a a lot of hookups and it all just feels unreal.

"Should i move on or move out? TLDR: my next door neighbour (M20) in my (F20) dorm dumped me in a very hurtful way because he for reasons I don‚Äôt understand wants to be with his ex girlfriend (F18). How can I forgive him? Should I try to become friends with him again or just move out?

I‚Äôm a college student and I live  in a dorm with 12 other people with whom I share a kitchen. We‚Äôre all pretty close, basically roomies. Over the summer me (F20) and the guy (M20) i live next to started hooking up/dating. We kept  it  a secret from the other people in our dorm. We‚Äôre both from the same town so it was pretty easy seeing each other when we were visiting our parents. When we hung out we would go thrifting, go to the beach and flower picking, stuff i thought was date - primarily because he also called it that. Over the summer he met a lot of my friends form home and I even let him sleep over at my parents house because I really thought we were seeing each other seriously. He even asked for us to be exclusive! A week ago I picked up on something, he was acting different and texting me less. I asked him about it but he told me he was just sick.  I accepted that. Also I  didn‚Äôt want to pry.  After that we didn‚Äôt see each other for a week ish. I was certain something was up so I told him I wanted to talk about something. We agreed to talk Monday evening. 

Then Monday afternoon I was texting him and he told me he was meeting his ex girlfriend (F18)  Then later, Monday evening when I get home, I text him again. I want to talk as we agreed to do. He opens my message but doesn‚Äôt reply. So after a while I text him again. He doesn‚Äôt reply to this one either. I can hear someone‚Äôs in his room. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the ex girlfriend. Some of the people from my dorm later tell me it‚Äôs her.  He continues to ignore my texts for a couple hours, when he replies he tells me we can talk when she‚Äôs gone home. It becomes really late and texts me saying we can talk tomorrow.  I am not pleased. So I go knocking on his door. I find out she‚Äôs still in there. However, he comes out to talk.  He‚Äôs crying and tells me he misses her. We agree to talk more tomorrow, as I feel kinda bad letting her sit alone in his room. He tells me they didn‚Äôt do anything sexually. 

The next day we talk. He tries to explain himself but keep changing his explanation. First he insists we were just FWB but later he says we were dating, he‚Äôs just not sure he could fall in love with me, although he thinks I‚Äôm sweet, intelligent, pretty and great in bed. I ask him if he‚Äôs in love with his ex. He tells me no, however he still wants to be with her. She doesn‚Äôt want to be with him. I don‚Äôt understand his decision but i respect it. 

We agreed to just be friends. I want us to be. However, later that night when we were watching a movie together in his room, he said that I could lay against him if I wanted to. I didn‚Äôt.  And I‚Äôm kinda mad he even asked. I feel so used. A part of me thinks that he still wants me. However, I know that it‚Äôs naive. I‚Äôve drunk texted him a few times, asking him what‚Äôs wrong with me since he cannot fall in love. I know I‚Äôve been too much with my messages. Normally I never do that. It‚Äôs like all my pride and self worth is completely gone. I feel so desperate and pathetic. He even told me not to text him about it anymore. I‚Äôve not reached out to him since. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to me either, which makes me question if there‚Äôs even basis for a friendship when I have to take all the initiative. I think about him all the time, partly because I can hear him talking and moving around in his room from mine. 

My problem is that I cannot seem to forgive him or forget him, though I really want to. He pursued me. He asked me on a date. He allowed me to get attached to him. Then he betrayed me and tried to convince me we were just hooking up, making me feel like dirt. I feel like he‚Äôs messing with my head and it hurts so much. I  cannot stand being with him. I hate hanging out with the other people in my dorm when he‚Äôs there, I hate that i have to hide that I‚Äôm sad. My self esteem has never been lower. I really like the people in my dorm so that really sucks. However, I‚Äôm not happy living next to him. It‚Äôs very stressful for me. Therefore I‚Äôm considering moving. Should I do it if I cannot forgive him? I want to forgive him, how should I do it? Do you think we can ever be friends again?  I feel like it‚Äôs unfair I have to do all of the effort to forgive him when he‚Äôs the one who hurt me. I need advice.

"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly. Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He‚Äôs very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He‚Äôs also balding, I definitely don‚Äôt care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it‚Äôs not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he‚Äôs very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he‚Äôs okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he‚Äôs with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don‚Äôt talk about men who don‚Äôt make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he‚Äôs very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I‚Äôm not. 

Like damn, I‚Äôm not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

"I expressed my needs to my BF and he felt overwhelmed I‚Äôve (23F) been with my bf (25M) for 5 months. I have a good time every time we hang out together. He makes me very secure and safe. And what‚Äôs more, he is adorably funny, caring, and really affectionate. 

But I‚Äôm seeing patterns of issues and things that make me want to have conversations with him.So the past week we had several conversations about these:

\* How often we see each other: I always have to ask him to stay with me for 2 nights on weekends. He would prefer if he only stays for 1 night because he sleeps better on his bed. He mentioned that one time he stayed for 2 nights at my place he didn‚Äôt have a great Monday the next week, and he needed good rest because he has a demanding work schedule (he works overtime), which I totally understand but I get attached and would miss him a lot. To be clear we only see each other once during the week or none at all (I come over to his place during the week cuz I have more flexible schedules). And weekend is usually when we spend most time together. He felt overwhelmed. I mentioned that I want to see him once during the week and 2 nights on the weekend, which made him feel like, at this speed, we were gonna see each other every day. And that is too fast for him. But I never said I want us to see each other every day. I feel misunderstood.

\* Sex: I expressed that I don‚Äôt get very turned on if we jump right into sex. I need more time for foreplay like cuddling, teasing, and kissing. I also expressed that it would be nice if I can keep a vibrator at his place because that‚Äôs the only way I get off and I don‚Äôt want to carry it around every time I visit his place otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. And he feels like I‚Äôm demanding a lot. He even said he felt like I was nitpicking but I really wasn‚Äôt. Sex is important to me and I‚Äôve been finding it hard to enjoy it because of the way he rushes to things.

\* Deciding things for me: I expressed that I‚Äôd appreciate it if he asks my opinions first instead of deciding things for me. I want him to ask me ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre going to this bar, do you want to join us?‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to XX. I assumed you wouldn‚Äôt like it. So I decided for you that you won‚Äôt join us without even asking.‚Äù

He said it feels to him that I have been the one expressing needs. He has never done that aka scheduling a time to have this sort of conversations. I mean, I love how he almost always says yes to my invites/plans (for example he said yes to a last-minute concert I wanted to watch). But I feel wronged too. Because I can tell he isn‚Äôt a people pleaser and he doesn‚Äôt struggle with expressing his needs. Every time he wants to do something he says it to me, and if it‚Äôs a no he just politely says no. So he never keeps resentments (?not sure what‚Äôs the right word, like when you did something you didn‚Äôt really want to and you felt uncomfortable/resentful about it- that kind of feeling) inside. I‚Äôm aware of my issues and have been going to therapy for me having difficulty expressing my own needs and setting boundaries, but I feel like he couldn‚Äôt understand my struggles.

Idk I‚Äôm feeling that we may just not be compatible with each other. I went through an amicable yet excruciating breakup due to incompatibility 2 years ago and it took me a long time to heal and be happy again. At this point I‚Äôm just tired and frustrated about another one. I don‚Äôt want to feel that way anymore.

He‚Äôs been a great boyfriend for me. He took really good care of me when I threw up one time and he was textbook good at calming me down when I had anxiety. A lot of things he did make me feel like oh wow that really is a green flag and I feel very loved in this relationship. But when I expressed that I have those unmet needs it led us into conflicts. I‚Äôm willing to work things out and we said we were gonna have another conversation this weekend. But I‚Äôm really anxious and stressed out about it. I really need advice on how to approach the conversation in a mature and healthy way.",Free_Narwhal7302,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bzujm/i_expressed_my_needs_to_my_bf_and_he_felt/,1690556413.0,1.0
"When should you be sure you're ready to date? I feel like it's a complicated issue. Sometimes I wonder if I myself should isolate myself from dating and romance just to prevent any undue toxicity from myself or others. 

We all have issues. We all deserve love. Attention. Care. We don't deserve to unleash out worst traits on someone; and just because we love someone it doesn't mean our bad sides can't be bad for them. Exhaust them. Etc. 

I've had interest in people I shouldn't have because they clearly had some things that needed to be resolved before they could maintain a healthy relationship. But is that a lack of thick skin on my part? A lack of patience? My own issues mixing with theirs in bad ways?

"Nervous About How a Double-Day Date Will Go Hey guys,

So I (30m) met this lady online (29f) and really hit it off. Like more than sparks it's electric kinda thing. So I am not worried about  whether she will like me per se; as it is clear she already does. But she is coming for two days and has a kind of wild side. I told her straight up I would love to accompany her but Im not this nightlife trailblazer and she said its ok we would be there for each other and she would teach me etc. My worry is less about impressing her and more about the inconvenience of bar and club hopping (finding one/waiting in line at this heat etc) ruining the vibe of the date.

"UPDATE: my M25 bf follows hundreds of explicit nsfw twitter accounts even after telling me he would unfollow all of them cause he wanted to do it for me. It makes me feel like he‚Äôd rather look at them than his own gf F18 EDIT: I BROKE UP WITH HIM. He took it better than I thought, and told me he still loves me and will always be there for me.

After reading the comments and messages, I was honestly surprised. I had no idea he was ignoring my boundaries and didn‚Äôt realize that he may be at fault a little. I admit I‚Äôm not perfect and I have a lot of issues I need to work on that don‚Äôt really include him. 

I know now that I need to breakup with him, but it breaks my heart. I‚Äôve shared so much with him and I‚Äôm honestly attached. I wanted everything to work out cause he is really sweet to me but the cons out way the pros. 

I‚Äôve never broken up with anyone before so I really don‚Äôt know how to go about it. Since we are in a ldr I can‚Äôt do it face to face and I honestly don‚Äôt have the courage to do it over the phone. I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll talk me out of it, even tho I know it‚Äôs for the best. 

I could really use any ideas or advice on how to breakup with him. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him cause I really care about him. I want him to be able to get over me quickly cause I‚Äôd hate for him to be sad over someone like me. 

Any ideas on ways to tell him I want to break up, that won‚Äôt make him feel bad about himself or undeserving of a relationship. I don‚Äôt want to have a negative affect on him and any future relationships he gets into.

"How to leave my gf in the most brutal way ? So for the context,

I have been dating my gf for almost 2 years and she is around 3 years older than me.

The problem dating her since the beginning was that she often used to emphasis about her cousin guy and lots of other relative guys wanting to marry her whenever we get into any conflict. I would rather use the word 'flex' because she used to say that she has lots of other option than me. But there has not been a single time when I let her doubt about any girl's name on our fights.

I thought her ego would get washed out with time after sometime but today I realized I was totally wrong.

For the present context , I happened to saw a chat between my gf and one of her old guy , the guy wanting to marry my gf which was also my gf's relative but not by blood. The guy called her for the facetime and after my gf didn't reply, he texted 'kali'. That word means 'dark color skin girl' (with a sense of love). And after few calls here and there they facetimed for some few minutes back and forth.

The problem here isn't that my gf talked with that guy. Back in honeymoon phase of our relationship I once called her you are my 'kali' and she was offended so bad that we nearly broke up and she still sometime taunts me about that incident whenever we have fights. But now she is okay with someone else calling her that word.

Yeah stayed loyal the whole time, loved her to edge but now I am profoundly not okay about what has happened and I think I should breakup with her in a very brutal way that she will regret her whole life.

"At what point does it become ignoring reality to keep trying? I‚Äôve been trying for 6 years and haven‚Äôt even been close to a success. 
If a person was trying to learn how to let‚Äôs say drive and every time they got behind the wheel they crashed horrifically. Every time they crash they try to figure out what they did wrong, they ask for advice from the people in their lives that know how to drive, they take drivers education courses, they do whatever they can in their power to make themselves a better driver and still, every time he gets behind the wheel, the car slams into a tree, into a ditch, into light posts. This goes on for 6 years.

Do you think he‚Äôd be better off quitting? At what point does continuing to trying to drive just begin idiotic? 

At what point are you supposed to just give up? This is my situation. I haven‚Äôt even had been able to get a number and I‚Äôm 22. I‚Äôm so behind everyone else. I‚Äôve been trying to improve and I‚Äôm no better off now then I was 6 years ago.

"is this love bombing and narcissistic behaviour? i live in another country and this guy texted me in order to get to know me. he seemed nice at first, even overly nice. he showed me his childhood photos, told me about his entire family and in general, opened up to me very fast as i think. of course, he said he liked me, and after all, i got so curious that i agreed to talk on the phone with him. again, everything seemed just fine but then we started texting even more and he started talking about visiting my country, which wasn‚Äôt weird at that point since he had some relatives here too. but his behaviour changed, he started talking about US, started calling me a few times a day and when i couldn‚Äôt pick up he literally resented me. and when i tried to call him back he wouldn‚Äôt answer üòê then we had some arguments about me not being nice enough to him (which wasn‚Äôt true, i was nice and cute, but had my own reasonable boundaries) but i kept telling him that i don‚Äôt even know him, why would i do that, i don‚Äôt take this communication seriously because i understand that he definitely has a lot of other girls in his own country and that he texts the same messages to them, and he got pissed off by those messages ( probably bc that was 100% true) and he deleted all the messages.

"Need help. Is this an attachment style or he‚Äôs just not into me? Hello men, I come here to seek some help.
I've known this man for 6 years. However, realistically only 2 years in total in person because during those 6 years, he was away for like 4 years on and off because he's a sailor.
1 genuinely like/love him and have for all these years;
I care about him. There hasn't been a day when I didn't speak to him or let him a message even if he was away.

My only confusion is, sometimes, he'd come with intense love but other times, he'd just act like a stranger. Absolute stranger. He'd go MIA for weeks and come back. And repeat. During these years, we've travelled together. Have seen each other's best and the worst. There's understand his life in sea must be very hard. Especially so since he hates his job.

My question is, is this an attachment style or he just doesn't like me at all. I'm confused. I don't want to push but at the same time am worried about his mental health onboard and do not want to leave him be because I felt too shy to text him.

"Why are people so nasty to each other in dating? I don‚Äôt know if this is an LA thing, or dating in general but I‚Äôve been trying to get back out there and all of the women I‚Äôve met so far have been one shade or another of insufferable flake.

2. A, does reiki and meditation and only seems to be interested in talking if I‚Äôm going to give her $20 to go to a reiki session. Granted the sessions are pretty nice, but she mentioned grabbing dinner after the next one only to ignore my next message. 

3. L, we used to hang out at the parties we met at, very evasive about hanging out anywhere else, and found a cliquey new group of girlfriends. 

4. T, sigh this still hurts, had a really nice time hanging out and dancing at a party. Tried to arrange a meeting phone dropped the call and she ignored my couple of texts afterwards.

"Finally met someone who sparks my interest after 3 years of being single - Are we moving too fast? I just turned 30 last year and have been single for the past three years. After I broke up with my Ex literally in Jan. 2020 it's been extremely hard to meet anyone who sparked my interest. I understand we had lock downs etc but I'm speaking after all that when people were going out and places were fully open overall. I had tried online dating on and off for the three years and it's been probably the most frustrating and draining experience of my entire life. I HIGHLY encourage people to use it with caution and prepare to be fucked around A LOT. For me I met a lot of girl online and even in person in town but I never clicked with anyone sadly. Intelligence is one of the key elements I look for and my god is it a dying breed. 

I was actually going to delete it again just a couple week ago when I got a match with a super cute girl. I told myself if this shit doesn't go anywhere I'm done. This girl took me by surprise and our first date we took a 2 mile walk and got caught in a down pour on the way back haha. It was kinda like a scene in a movie or something it didn't bother us at all which I thought was fun. We spent the next 3 days together which also has never happened with other girls. It's always ""I'll let you know"" ""I have to see if I'm busy"" all that type bullshit. This girl truly wanted to get to know me and the last girl that did that was my ex I met 6 years prior (Sad but true) I had some casual encounters but nobody I felt something for that was also reciprocated.  

I'm on the 4th week with this girl (28F) and we have spent a lot of time together and I have had a lot of emotions in my head more than I know what to do with. This girl has taken me by surprise at every turn. I guess I have been waiting for something to go wrong or to see if she's legit and I can honestly say she is. I'm just extremely nervous about the future since it's just been so long for me so I feel rusty.

So, there are some matches on the dating apps, where as soon as you swipe right, the person hints you about the questions you can ask to initiate a conversation. As soon as you do that, the other person goes like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a really horny story..very unusual and intriguing..‚Äô And when you ask them, it‚Äôs more or less like ‚Äòyou know we ended up having a threesome in my last date!‚Äô

"4 years ago GoatLord8 found his girlfriend in this sub through a form he launched to find friends who don‚Äôt just send boring replies. What if AI could do that for you? I found a wholesome post on MNFH subreddit where a guy from Sweden launched a form with questions like how fast you reply, how open you are in conversation etc and the 8th response was of a girl from Turkey which stood out to him. They eventually started dating and the guy even flew to Turkey and shared a picture of their [first hug at the airport](https://imgur.com/a/DplfgFi). (can't link the post because auto mod keeps deleting).

What if there was an app where you post your introduction and let AI know what you are looking for. So if you are not someone who like people who text out of boredom or who have other intentions than what you are looking for, you can ask the bot to match people accordingly.

The way I plan to do is by making an app only for redditors out there making friends online where unlike any other social app, there are no comments but only posts where every reply on that post is a conversation. It is up to the person to either reply privately or publicly, in which case he will also let other people discover his thoughts through his conversations.

The AI will use those conversations to know people and make better matches. Obviously when it is a private conversation the AI would be out of picture.

"Went on a really weird date Yesterday I (24 F) matched with a guy (23 M) on bumble. He invited me over almost immediately. I said no but that I was free today. We agreed on coffee and then maybe going to my place. Usually I'd wait longer to go out with someone I met online but I was feeling spontaneous. I did tell him I don't sleep with guys on the first date and he respected that. 

We exchanged numbers. I texted him but didn't save his contact (I was going to if the date went well). He was overly friendly through text and acted like he knew we'd be dating for awhile. I politely told him to slow it down a little bit didn't cancel the date. 

On the actual date we kept a conversation flowing but he was extremely unemotional. It looked like he attempted to smile once or twice but couldn't figure out how to. I picked most of the conversation topics which is fine but it would've been nice if he had brought up at least one. Eventually he went to the bathroom, came back and said ""I appreciate you coming out but I don't think we're clicking. See you later."" I just said ""okay bye"" and hungout at the cafe for awhile. I had a feeling we wouldn't keep dating but it was still weird. Usually when a guy doesn't want to see me anymore (or vice versa) the discussion happens after the date.

"My(31M) girlfriend(32F) keeps stonewalling me whenever we have an argument/disagreement. It's giving me stress and anxiety and I cannot take it anymore. I started dating this girl about 3 months ago. The first month was pretty amazing. But the honeymoon phase ended way too early and we started getting into arguments/disagreements by the 2nd month itself. Whenever we have a disagreement, she sometimes gets agitated and starts gaslighting me. She often gets very angry and shuts me down by saying ""I don't want to talk right now"" and walks off. She doesn't come back until she cools down. If I try to bring up the discussion again, she just shuts me down by saying ""We already had a discussion over this and I hate going in circles"". Now this has happened way too many times for me to ignore. The inability to have a civilized discussion over any disagreement is giving me a lot of stress and anxiety because I'm being forced to bottle up my feelings. I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her because I don't know what I do or say might accidentally trigger her and I don't want to get into fights every day. I have also observed that she just cannot handle losing an argument. If an argument ends up in her giving up, she tries to bring up something totally random from the past to keep the fight going until she feels like she has won the argument. I'm really tired of this and have been thinking of breaking up with her.

Mostly because I don't enjoy the online apps and I don't want kids so that's a dealbreaker for like 95+% of women. I'm not super motivated as I'm mostly fine on my own, but I do want to meet someone special to build a life together with.

About a week ago I found a nice childfree woman my age not too far away, we spoke for a few days online and it turned out we had some things in common and some similar views on life. This is uncommon for me so I was excited to meet her! We had a date a few days ago and it turned out we had even more in common regarding political stance and such. She's smart, funny and has a communication style that I really appreciate.

On paper, she's great!

But I feel no romantic or physical attraction. Like, at all.   
I'm not curious about getting to know her more, I don't feel like I want to meet her again.

And it's so frustrating!Meeting a woman that is so close to what I want happens so seldom.

"We spent every moment of two weeks together, now he tells me about the other girl. Sorry about the long post, but this is my first post here and wanted to give the full story.

A month ago (23F) started this thing with a friend (27M) of mine. I was out of a 3 year relationship and had something going on afterwards with a close friend (24M). Let‚Äôs call 27M A and 24M B.  The thing with B had ups and downs and it was never anything exclusive. During this period A started showing a lot of interest in me, texting and asking to do things together. We weren‚Äôt very close back then but I always enjoyed his company so I was always up for it as well. We started to hang out a lot and got along so well. When we got drunk we were always flirting with each other and I really liked the attention and always found him very attractive. Getting along so well was an added bonus. Other people started to notice this and I got asked a few times if there was anything going on between A and I. A friend of mine who is way closer with A also told me that this guy really likes me and I should stop with B whatever that is and go for this guy (also because B was flirting with this other girl). 

I was quite confused at this stage because even though I really liked B it was always a bit problematic with him and now A charmed me a lot. For other reasons we stopped seeing each other romantically with B and decided to stay good friends. 

After a night out together with all of our friends, we went to A‚Äôs place to have an after party but nobody else was up for it. That night we stayed up till the morning and when I wanted to go home he asked me to stay over. We just cuddled all night and spent the next day together in bed, nothing else happened. Next day after a dinner at our friends place, A asked me to come over again, so I stayed at his place and we had sex. From that night onwards for about 2 weeks we slept together every night, spent the next day together and did a lot of fun things together. It was an amazing time but in the end I went back home for the summer and he will move to another country end of summer.

I always thought we wouldn‚Äôt talk a lot when I‚Äôm back home but we texted so far everyday and he wanted to call me quite often. We make each other laugh a lot, have a great connection going on and are very attracted to each other. But he is moving away so I wanted to ask him what would happen then. I never wanted a serious relationship, especially nothing long distance but I felt like I had to communicate my feelings. When I told him that I really like spending time with him and talking to him but it confuses me as well because he is moving away - he replied back with if I knew what is going on with his ex at the moment. I knew a bit but not so much in detail. So with this girl it never worked out because they were never at the same place at the same time and she never wanted anything exclusive at the time with him, so they agreed to see how it goes when he moves back to the city she lives in. 

We never had a conversation with each other about what we wanted from each other, I guess were both sure that we didn‚Äôt want anything serious but then we connected really well and it ended up being more than that. I‚Äôm confused because when I told him about my feelings and doubts, instead of him talking about his feelings he opened up the subject of his ex even though it was never a concern before. It seems to me that he avoided expressing his feelings. When I said maybe it‚Äôs better we just stop, he didn‚Äôt want that either. He said that he really likes me and enjoyed our time but can‚Äôt say anything right now because he is confused. He wanted sometime to think and meanwhile wants to keep in touch. He also asked me if it‚Äôs suppose to be everything or nothing.

Now I‚Äôm left wondering if in the end our connection was not so special and this was a casual relationship. But even if it is, he doesn‚Äôt want to let go of me. I‚Äôm also confused by what it means to have a casual relationship or if he is being a red flag over all.",smallandfurious69,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15bvf1m/we_spent_every_moment_of_two_weeks_together_now/,1690545479.0,1.0

"Outdated or new normal? Hi all, 

Male, 40, divorced here. 

I‚Äôve been through the ringer the last year, but have taken time to find myself once again and work on myself via therapy, friends and working out, of course. It‚Äôs a process and so I know more time is needed and one is never a complete human. 

My question pertains to a couple of patterns I have encountered while dipping my toe into the dating pool. 

Both encounters for me went way better in person than via text and I felt like I‚Äôd established enough of a connection to maintain contact via text until the next meeting, which hadn‚Äôt happened. 

I am an open person and I‚Äôm not afraid to have tough conversations for better clarity. I would rather someone tell me that they‚Äôre not interested than what I am seeing via text.

It almost seems to me that expressing interest in seeing them, trying to have loose playful conversations before meeting, worked for me in the past. Admittedly, that was before online dating and texting became standard operating procedure.

I understand that maybe these women were not entirely interested in me from my recent experience. I had a good time with both of them and felt that perhaps something would come of it.

My question is, do y‚Äôall feel that the text game is one where you express limited interest, without much inclination to meet in order to be a viable match. 

What I‚Äôve seen on that end, is very limited texting, more recently, a text or two a day with only a couple sentences. For me that put a lot of pressure to say something meaningful while matching their effort. Needless to say, both dates fizzled out in the virtual world. 

I‚Äôm not interested in being anyone other than myself (playing games to increase interest), but I do understand that the nature of dating has changed, the conversation style has changed, and I think, despite the promiscuousness of the scene, people are more guarded with their thoughts than their bodies. 

Am I accurate or am I just an outdated model of a man? 

Help me improve and get a much needed update. I don‚Äôt want to game the system, but I also don‚Äôt want to lose good connections from the wild whilst trying to manage the virtual realm poorly as I see it now.

"Husband does not want to get intimate What does it mean if my husband no longer wants to be intimate with me? Should I be worried? We got married at 21, and have now been married for 5 years.

"UPDATE: She asked to be exclusive, I agreed. Then she changed her mind a week later. Big date coming up, and I want an answer so I don‚Äôt waste my time. Hey All!

So posted a few weeks back about a girl I met on Bumble and how she flipped-flopped on wanting to be exclusive.
I appreciate all the advice you guys gave!

We ended up going to the concert/festival together and had a pretty great time.
But - something very important came up that made me change my mind about the whole thing. 

I learned she is still in communication with her ex and clearly not over him. She talked to me a few times on previous dates about how she is still upset with him for cheating on her, but I just took those conversations as her opening up to me. However, at the show she made an effort to tell me that her ex was texting her during the show and again talked about how she is angry at him and really hopes ""karma teaches him a lesson."" 

This was the main deal breaker for me. I know some people get over their exes by jumping back into dating, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. At this point I realized that she's probably just dating around and looking for a distraction. The day after the show I asked for some space and took about a week off from talking to her so I could think things over. That Friday I made the call to end things since she wasn't ready for what I was looking for. 

Thankfully, she was understanding about it and things ended OK. I chose to remove all contact on phone/social media etc. 

I'm still bummed that I gotta start over as I really liked her, but I know that it was best for me to call it there and move on.",AnOrangePenguin,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15b6tuy/update_she_asked_to_be_exclusive_i_agreed_then/,1690476361.0,1.0

"Is what my girlfriend is doing toxic? I (34M) started dating my girl (33F) about a month ago. We went official after talking for a while. I suffer from ADHD and many times I forget some small things that were discussed or said. My girl has always been saying that she hates repeating herself because she does that at work with people she manages and it drives her crazy. 
She sometimes makes plans with her friends to go watch a movie or hang out or some shit. Most of the times she tells me. But today she suddenly said she was going to a movie with her girlfriend. She said she told me about but I don't think she did. She kept insisting but I forgot or didn't pay attention. I'm a movie person and I would at least remember the name if she did. 
But since she hates repeating herself, she didn't tell me what movie she is going to or where, despite me asking her a couple times. I kinda find this behavior shady, even though I believe she's not the type of person to cheat.

"Women can love more than one man at the same time. Many men I have spoken to believe women are incapable of loving two men simultaneously.    They are under this illusion that once a woman develops feelings for guy #2, she will withdraw from guy #1.  

I‚Äôd like to share with those who believe women cannot love two men at the same time. 

I‚Äôve personally got myself tangled up twice with women who were in love with me and with their other partner.    The situation was extremely frustrating and overwhelmed with sadness.   

These two women would make out with me and have sex with me but would not separate themselves from their other partners.      They also enjoyed having sex with those people.   

When I found out I ended the relationships but they would cry and become extremely angry and threatening.    They would bombard my phone with texts and calls begging me not to leave, that they would dump their partner to secure me, though that never happened, and would never happen.   

When a woman loves more than one guy simultaneously, this is called polyamory.     She will never let go off one partner for the other.    And she will do her best to meet her partners physical needs.  

Just felt like sharing this.",Lexusowner40,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15c41fr/women_can_love_more_than_one_man_at_the_same_time/,1690566141.0,0.17

Online dating and IRL hybrid concept So I'm thinking about having a bunch of business cards with a basic online dating profile description printed on them with a Google phone number. I even might make one of those free websites and create a dating profile and have a QR code on the card that links to it. Then I could just go around and hand them out to any girl who I find attractive. As a girl would this completely weird you out or would you be intrigued? I figure it would be cheaper than a membership for a dating site and it would reach some girls who might not be into the whole online dating scene.,RavenousFox1985,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15boo2h/online_dating_and_irl_hybrid_concept/,1690523186.0,1.0
