"r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric. There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted and misguided conversation plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included red/black-pill ideology, ""alpha-male"" talk, and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of concerns with you in a more healthy way. Misandry is as equally intolerable. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose sight of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**",SyCams,5483,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/es2cek/rdating_is_not_the_place_to_soapbox/,1579646134.0,0.98

"Do men exist who actually voluntarily help their partner cum every time they have sex? Genuinely curious here. I‚Äôve had two long term relationships and a handful of other sexual partners. It wasn‚Äôt until this year with my current boyfriend that I finally finished with a partner. We‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs really only possible for me with a vibrator. I understand using one during a session isn‚Äôt the most convenient and definitely takes more time and effort to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù than it would without it, but even so‚Äîit‚Äôs the only way I can finish! My boyfriend knows this yet rarely initiates using it. I totally understand that it‚Äôs partially my responsibility to ensure I‚Äôm satisfied, but shouldn‚Äôt he feel some responsibility too?? It just confuses me so much because he is truly the most kind, loving, and attentive person otherwise. I don‚Äôt understand why he doesn‚Äôt really care to help me cum as much as I help him cum (which is every single time we have sex). Like, isn‚Äôt that a reasonable expectation? To cum every time he cums? Or does the requirement of a vibrator make it unreasonable somehow? How does he not even feel bummed or guilty?? I always feel a little bummed if he can‚Äôt finish that day for whatever reason.

"I'm (F30) ugly and have never had a good experience dating. Should I opt for cosmetic surgery? I dont want to be alone. F30, work in engineering, have NEVER had a good experience with dating. Was bullied as a child and teenager for my looks and it has persisted in adulthood. I go to the gym but can't do anything about my face, which is asymmetrical and my facial features are not considered attractive. I dont have any of the features that are normally considered good looking or attractive.

Never had good dating experience. Have been ignored my whole adult life and rarely get matches on Tinder. And when I get matches on Tinder, they stop answering if I initiate conversation.

I've had sex twice, with two different guys a couple of years ago, I was drunk and they were ashamed of being seen with me in public places. Men usually ignore me and are provoked by my ugliness.

Right now I'm seeing my life pass by and I'm perpetually alone while my friends and family are getting married, having children etc. I've asked my girlfriend what the problem is but they have not been able to be truthfull when everyone knows its the ugliness. I'm considering cosmetic surgery to at least have a chance to date someone. Men just arent attracted to me and I dont wanna be 50 and still be alone.

Any other women who have gone through the same experience? Did dating get easier for you?

"The results of me giving up dating. Over 5 months ago I posted here an overdramatic post. It was me, declaring that I give up dating I am done with searching for love and I am now focusing on being THE WORST (= not trying to be nice and desirable) version of myself. I applied.

I passionately hate the saying that *when you stop searching - the love will find you*, because it makes no sense. The irony of it all is that when I stoped searching for love, she DID find me. And I didn't want her at first!

I had a colleague, I met him some time ago, we live in the same neighbourhood. He lowkey had a crush on me, but he was so not my type. He looked to me like Chicken Little with ADHD. He confessed his attraction to me, but I did not fancy talking poultry, I JUST gave up dating and had no desire to change our relations. He quickly shrugged it off, so we continued spending time together sometimes. Lowkey, without any fireworks.

And one day, after something that supposed to be a quick meeting that turned into a whole day spent together I looked at him and I saw A MAN. It clicked, just like that. I realised that he has all the qualities I was looking for in my miserable process of dating. He's smart, confident, loving life. He's caring, happy and independent. His amazing personality somehow manipulated my brain to think he's attractive. Now I know he is - inside and out. And I can't believe how blind and stupid I was at first. 

...so this time I confessed my attraction for him. He was suprised at first, but now we're so happy together it's disgusting.

What I want to say is: I still do not believe that if you'll give up the love will find you. I don't really believe that dating someone not your type would always end up happily either. But I believe that if  you struggle like I was, I highly recommend acknowledgling your current dating pattern and shitting on it. Change something. Do something out of character. Stop prioritizing love and value potential frendships more. Maybe give up for a while, like I did! 

I keep my fingers crossed for you, whatever you're  looking for. Some of you helped me on this sub before and honestly I wish I could do the same.

"Boyfriend no longer interested in sex I(24F) know it sounds like he(31) isn't interested in being with me anymore but hear me out. We have been together 1.5 years and we had a great sex life. Apart from my relationship anxiety our relationship is as close to perfect as it gets.

But for more than the past 6 months he stopped initiating sex. Never asks for photos or sexts me. He has a lot of trouble getting hard and most of the time when I initiate things he doesn't reciprocate so I end up giving up. I have confronted him several times and he says that he has performance anxiety because now that our relationship is more serious he wants to ""perform better"". But he starts panicking and that he can't get hard and it sabotages him further.

We have discussed it several times and he says he is working on it. But have had sex twice since February this year- even then he hasn't been able to stay hard. I feel terrible every time I bring it up and he actually got really angry the other day and said he isn't having the conversation again. 

But to be honest, it is getting really difficult for me. I never imagined myself being in my mid-20s in a sex-less relationship. Its less about orgasms and pleasure and more about intimacy, feeling connected to him and feeling desired and wanted by him.

Am I an asshole for feeling this way? I dont know what to do. I feel like if I bring it up again I am being rapey lol.

"How to Cope With the Crush of Your Life Getting Married to Someone Else? This really broke me and i dont know how to deal with it. Last summer i had a situationship with this amazing girl. we vibed, constantly talked, hung out, held hands, got intimate, for well over 2 months, and i had every impression in the world that this was imminently about to turn into ""official"", but it just didnt. There was apparently another guy in the picture the whole time but she was just living away from him for the university program (so she gained feelings for me, and almost ""switched"" to me) but in the end, the decision was between us two, and she ultimately chose him, despite every sign that she lost feelings for the other one. Its obviously her right to do that for sure, but i am devastated even a year later, and now i am finding out she is getting married next spring. She had been constantly feeling sad and depressed that i no longer wanted to be her friend and text her regularly, but i had to do it and cut contact. i Just dont see her as a friend.  
This girl was the love of my life, and has the most amazing personality, smile, laugh, and heart. Butterflies in my stomach every single time i saw her, and we would vibe and chill till 3am in the summer all the time. Never remotely felt like this about someone. Everything about her body, hair, and face was 10/10 and we even had the same interests in so many hobbies and art things. I have no idea what to do to cope, and cant help but think ill ever have this deep of a level of love for another girl. this was genuinely ""the one"", or at least, i thought. Ive tried online dating and every single date i go on, i just wish it was the other girl sitting beside me, instead of the date, even if the dates were technically good. ive blocked her on everything and never reach out or anything like that, but i cant stop thinking about her and i constantly have dreams that im with her.

"Liberal men who date, why are you paying for the date? This question is posed for all liberal and progressive men- why do you guys pay for dates?

"Could any guys give me an idea of how he truly feels about me? I‚Äôve (17f) been dealing with the same boy (19m) since March 20th. Since then I have become completely obsessed with him. First time linking we did f***. Initially, we started off using a condom and then he took it off. After that, we been f****ing raw ever since and he nuts in me everytime. We never been in a relationship but in the beginning I did mess up and that completely ruined his trust for me (even though we weren‚Äôt dating). He stopped fucking with me for about a week then we started talking randomly when he was curious about my shroom plug. We then started texting and he said he missed me. long story short, we‚Äôve been on and off like this for a while. when he‚Äôs with me, he‚Äôs very affectionate and we get along so well. but once he leaves, we hardly talk. we followed eachother on social media but a while ago he unfollowed me so i did the same. since us being involved with eachother he always watches my story but hasn‚Äôt followed me back. a month ago, he called me late night to spend the night. me being absolutely infatuated with him, i obviously agreed. being in his presence makes me so happy like i‚Äôve never felt this way about any guy. anyways, he comes over and the typical things happen. we enjoy eachothers company, fucked about 3 times (everytime him nutting in me) and me cooking for him, cuddling, etc. Me being a dumbass and acting like a lil girl, i got to geeking and telling his closest friends that he nutted in me (i was drunk at the time and too excited talking about him). he texts me the next day very mad and calling me names and even said fuck me. a month goes by and like last week he texts me asking how i been. we get to talking he then says he‚Äôs going to come over. i ask why and he says he wants to see me. obviously i let him come because i missed him. now this was last week on wednesday he came over. we did shrooms and that was honestly the best time we‚Äôve spent together. when we‚Äôre together we act like best friends. us being off shrooms with eachother for the first time, it was amazing. i cooked us food like usual. we talked about real things, were all over eachother, laughing at everything. we went on a walk and talked about conspiracies yk things of that nature. it was such a good time he texted me when he got home that he loved what we did that day and he enjoyed spending time with me. he was being very sweet .
i‚Äôm so confused and lost. i‚Äôm so hurt i just need some insight.

(p.s.) everytime we‚Äôve talked he has always expressed not wanting to be in a relationship. when we were off shrooms talking about things that was one of them. he told me his trust is so fucked up from his ex girlfriend and said he could never trust another female again which i understand. i asked if he could trust me he said no. he does like me hence him not being able to leave me alone. when we fuck, he insists on doing it raw and doesn‚Äôt seem to care about the risks. and he nuts in me with no second thoughts or doubt. he also expressed that he fucks with me so much because he‚Äôs comfortable around me and can be himself. i have good energy and i‚Äôm a good person. he even said i can be a good woman to my man because i cook clean and take care of him like as if he was my husband when he comes over. he loves this about me. he goes on to say i have good qualities and i‚Äôm a good girl.

My bf lives an hour away and he works two hours away. He sometimes travels for work. Recently he‚Äôs been traveling for work and work seven days a week. He still makes time for me which I love. 

Recently he had to travel to Florida for work. During the trip I asked him if he would like to go to my fathers bday party. He says this; 

Of course I want to see your father and I want to be there on your fathers birthday, so I'll try to make it time for your father's birthday and of course for you don't forget you are my love and I like you so much. 

Idk if it‚Äôs bc he‚Äôs been working so much but I been feeling distance from him. At one point I even asked him if he still wants to be with me and he said yes. But I still feel distance. Lately I been initiating a majority of communication. I texted him this morning and said;

Also I‚Äôm not trying to nag but like I understand you‚Äôre working hard and I respect your work ethic but like lately I have felt like I‚Äôm in this relationship kind of alone. Tomorrow can we maybe talk about this ? 

He ended up calling me twice today but I still feel like he‚Äôs been distant ? Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking and just miss him I‚Äôm just confused.

"Boy (26) I went out with didn‚Äôt look like his pictures‚Ä¶ I (25f) went on a date with this guy recently. He had hats on in all his pictures so I kind of figured he was probably insecure with his hair or something. I gave him a shot because he seemed super sweet and we had similar dating goals. I go on the date and he had very little hair and seemed to be chubbier in person. I don‚Äôt know if he used old photos but the moment I saw him, I was taken aback. 

However, the date was short but sweet. The conversation flowed and he was still very kind. Now I‚Äôm confused whether to see him again or not.

"How long to wait to date again Got out of a long term relationship not too long ago that ended horribly and messed me up pretty bad. I dont walk around actively angry or anything but im definitely not fully past the situation.

There's a guy there I get on with. We text a lot and have hung out very casually a few times. I was not wanting to date this soon and I'm surprised how interested I am in him.

He asked me on an official date and I'm leaning towards no due to the short span of time between my last and this but we seem to have a decent amount of chemistry.

Would you feel comfortable dating someone who just got out of a long term serious relationship a few months ago or would it be more respectful to wait. I think there's a lot of potential here and I'd rather start it off right even if I wait.

So, you could say I am a little inexperienced. I am 5' 11"" go to the gym on regular basis and try to stay healthy. Anyways, I met this girl on hinge. First day was great. we got to know eachother a little. Had two drinks. Hugged her goodbye and we parted away. We met briefly the week after for coffee and walked around. I asked her if she wanted to continue to see me, and she said yes but wanted to take things slow.  I was totally ok with that. Btw I was planning everything. I text her regularly and asking about her dates, etc. I took her to a nice resturant, we walked around after and took a picture together. I wanted to kiss her at that point, but I wasn't sure because ""she wanted to take things slow"". She texted me that night saying she had a great time and loved the pic of us together. After that day, I always initiated texts but she would take hours to respond (I understand we are both in a very demanding profession). Then, she texted me saying that she is not ready for anything serious now and she does not want to lead me on. I told her I respect your decision, and wished her luck. I am not going to lie, this dating game sucks. I don't if I did anything wrong here.

"How do I navigate through "" I'm not ready for a relationship""? We both are post grad students (m24) &amp; (f22). Met on campus and had an instant click. No awkward phase, just instant connection to the point where we have been hanging out just talking every night for the past couple of months. There have been moments past ""just talking"" in some instances. But nothing has progressed past that.
The issue arises when I bring up our situation, I met her just days after her breakup. She is a very moralistic person in every aspect of her life and it also exudes in her relationships. She genuinely thought he was her soulmate and this breakup took a big toll on her. Also to point out she has clinical ADHD so emotionally she was a wreck. 
Now 3 months later she seems to be in a better place emotionally but is adamant on the fact that she would not date anyone ever. I know it sounds like something everyone says post breakup but this has been affecting us, she says she likes me but isn't going to date anyone. This has been a underlying issue when we interact, because bringing it up stresses her ADHD brain out to the point she just ignores this. She does feel guilty/sad when I tell her I'm happy to wait and see where this goes but I don't see what else would be the right thing in this situation.
One day she also confessed that she needs to work on her choices since she has always craved that intense feelings with someone ( controlling/toxic). Now that toxic traits is something I genuinely worked on and you can see traces of it but overall I'd say I'm pushing more towards a stoic demeanour. So for her to say that really made me question things. A part of me wants to bring back the toxic traits but I feel the manipulation in that way would leave me feeling guilty since I wasn't being pure about my intentions. I might point it out that I do have some sociopathic tendencies so if I think about it, manipulating her to stimulate that toxic liking side of her would not be a difficult task.

Please advise how to navigate this because I don't see a clear picture. I just know we are really good together and I would regret going away not knowing what it could've been like",Small_Refuse7803,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15gng1t/how_do_i_navigate_through_im_not_ready_for_a/,1691018653.0,1.0
"I really like this guy at work that's 35 years old, but he said he's never had a girlfriend. There's a guy at work that I really like and has himself together. He's told me that he bought a house 5 years ago and moved in his mother and two younger sisters. I asked him why and he said so they would have the opportunity to save money since his mother and sister were always broke growing up. One of his sisters is also 11 years old from a different father and said one of the reasons he moved them in was so that his 11 year old sister could have her own room. I asked him what about dating and girlfriends and he says that he's never had a girlfriend. When I asked why, he said he was always more stressed about being poor growing up, but when he started making good money in his late 20's and bought his house at 31, he is a lot more open to a girlfriend, but now he's trying to buy a house for his mother.  

His sister however is a strange case because he said she's only a couple of years younger than he is and even though she gives him money for rent (He says he doesn't charge his mother rent), she doesn't have a job and hasn't worked in years. He did say she is doing coding classes from home but says she has been doing that for years. I know I was wrong to ask, but I asked him if she was disabled and he said she is not and is just a normal girl.  
So what's the deal with this guy? He's very sweet and respectful and keeps to himself for the most part.

"Is this little amount of texting normal? So I (26f) have been seeing this guy (32m) for almost a month now. We usually hang out once a week, for usually almost all day. We usually visit museums, get dinner, explore dessert places, and sometimes bars. He is super sweet and affectionate, but the one problem i have is the lack of texting. For the first few dates, we wouldn't really talk at all during the week, except once when i asked about a place that we were gonna visit, plus also when i texted him just to confirmed. He was always quick to respond.

I didn't bring it up to him then because i didnt want to appear clingy, plus after we hooked up the first time (no sex, just him giving me oral, plus making out and cuddling) he started to message me every other day, like even just to ask if i saw some movie. He even double texted me last week and sent me a video of something and when i didnt respond (i was asleep) he sent a message a few hours later talking about getting some type of food when we hang next, which was also last week. I think he also doesnt want to appear clingy, since i complained about having a clingy ex once, and since then, if i mention a previous guy, he will ask if it was the clingy one, so obviously he remembers my ex was clingy for a reason. I also remember him saying that his mom kinda neglected him as a kid because he was the middle child, and basically left him alone to play video games or whatever, and how he liked being left alone. So maybe that has something to do with it? 

He has shown evidence of moving kinda fast, like trying to give me a spare key to his place because wanted me to spend the night last week. I just said i wanted to stay when he off the whole weekend, and he was agreeable and didnt push any boundaries. He also has been testing the waters by constantly talking about us doing things in the future together, plus we have discussed kids many times already because he has asked more than once how many i want (including the first date), and called my responses a good compromise. He also referred to me a few weeks ago as the woman he is seeing. One time we were talking about my car, and he made a comment of me not needing it if i were to move somewhere where i dont need one (in his area, a lot of people dont have cars because its a major city).

And we hung out earlier this week (for the fifth time), we hand sex this time, and we are scheduled to hang out next weekend (the one where i am staying the night). We cant hang this weekend since he will be visiting family. I'm ok with that, but its been 3 days and we havent spoken. I was thinking of maybe texting him on friday and wishing him luck with his family in a joking way, since he wasn't looking forward to seeing them. But idk, in the past if i have to text a guy first, it was a bad sign. But this guy seems really reciprocal when i text him, and this is the first time that i'm actually seeing someone who is taking me out on dates and such, so i'm not sure how this works. He has proven to be trustworthy and reliable, so i'm not sure if he just isn't a big texter, or doesn't want to appear over bearing.

I‚Äôm not sure how to describe my roommates relationship but it is non-monogamy if you are hooking up with the same sex (they are both bi) but no direct cheating with the opposite sex - that‚Äôs the way it was explained to me. 

But the reason why I‚Äôm writing this is because I just find myself agonized in thought about how lonely I am all to often 

And they only conclusion I have is that my proximity to their relationship is what‚Äôs causing my difficulties trying to get up on my feet in a relationship sense (this could be totally wrong so please point it out) 

It‚Äôs been bad for me especially recently because a new person has been added to the mix. They will be over one night and then the next the just the couple.

There have only been 2 scenarios in my dating life so far and they are the reason I‚Äôve been single my whole life. 

Either: 

- I get to date a girl I don‚Äôt find attractive (but she finds me attractive) and hence I stop the process by telling her that I don‚Äôt feel any romance/attraction but we can stay friends if I felt at least some connection 

Or: 

- I get to date a girl that is ‚Äòabove my league‚Äô apparently and get ghosted and I feel like shit. Similar as the first situation - but vice versa and just so much more evil. Why pretend to have a good time but then ghost me? 

I‚Äôm average looking, but I‚Äôm active and I take a lot of pride and worth into grooming and spend a lot of money on my fashion and appearance.

"Do you ever hide your personal interests when dating? I'm referring to interests and hobbies. I'm a young man (early 20s), and I have an interest in getting back into video games for the challenge that comes with learning. I also learned how to make a quilt many years ago, and I'd like to do it again someday. Other than that, I'm into things like reading, cooking, working out, etc. However, if I were ever in the early stages of talking to a woman I was interested in and she asked me about my hobbies and interests, I would probably leave the video games and quilting out. I would be afraid that she would think it was too nerdy or not ""manly"" enough for me to be interested in those things.

I texted her asking what was going on and all I got back was that she couldn't do it anymore and that she's sorry. Nothing from her, her family, her friends, just straight up mystery. My friends said I should take some time to deal with it, but I'm more shocked than depressed. Especially considering that we just signed a year long lease. Why on earth would someone do that, and then not give any context? So messed up.


*update* I had a lengthy talk with the landlord, and he said he has no problem taking her off the lease if she doesn't return his calls. She has until Friday to call him or she'll be removed from the lease. He said he had a similar issue with his ex wife when they bought their first house. She tried to sell it, keep the money, and leave him with nothing. 

Still no idea where she is, or what she's doing, but now I'm getting things in order as far as making sure her mail goes to her family.

"Feeling like we‚Äôre denying a true connection Hi, this is super long but I wanted to give a full picture. So, I (20, queer &amp; non-binary) have an odd situation with with a friend of mine (19, pansexual &amp; a man). We‚Äôve known each other for about two years. We met through school and have been acquaintances for that entire time. We have mutual friends so we‚Äôve crossed paths on many occasions throughout this time. We have even matched on dating apps before (I could never tell if it was like ‚Äúoh hey bestie‚Äù or a way of expressing interest). Earlier this year we had our respective friend groups overlap way more and started to actually foster our friendship. So, especially once the summer started we began spending a lot of time together. I work until about 10pm most days and even with it being late he‚Äôd come and pick me up and we‚Äôd hangout till 2-3 a.m.. 

I know we are sexually attracted to each other. At one point during a drinking game played with our friends; one of the cards said something along the lines of ‚Äúpick someone in the group to say something to that you‚Äôd never say otherwise‚Äù. He picked me and said that he‚Äôs been attracted and wanted to hookup with me since we first met. While I had always thought he was attractive, it was that moment that made me realize he may be interested in me. But, I admittedly didn‚Äôt do anything for a bit. 

As we continued to hang out more, I realized I really like him. I‚Äôm interested in him in a way that hasn‚Äôt happened in years for me. So‚Ä¶ I wrote him a letter asking him out (I was way too fucking nervous to say it in person. I wanted to actually be able to be cognizant about it so that‚Äôs what I did). He said he wanted to think about it and I totally respected that. A few days later we talked about it and he said it wasn‚Äôt lack of interest, but since he‚Äôs studying abroad in a little while, he doesn‚Äôt want to start something that can‚Äôt be followed through on. He even said he was going to keep the letter because of how special it was to receive it and he thought it was cute. Honestly, I totally understood though. There were no hard feelings whatsoever and our friendship genuinely hasn‚Äôt been affected. I noticed for a few days we were maybe not as touchy with each other, but then we completely settled back into our routine. 

Anyways, he‚Äôs been acting really affectionate lately. Enough that our friends have been noticing. Another example being he and I as well as some other mutual friends went to a reservoir the other day and he and I got in the water for a bit and actually ended up skinny dipping at one point. One of these friends told me after the fact that our other friends wondered in the moment when we were finally going to kiss (they‚Äôre aware that I asked him out). And we‚Äôve had people recently asking if we‚Äôre together when spending time with other people we don‚Äôt know well. 

He‚Äôs also just really complementary in private and we spend a lot of time like holding hands, laying our heads on each other, etc. and like with what he said during the drinking name, typically I‚Äôd be concerned that he just wants to have sex with me. But he hasn‚Äôt suggested that or anything. 

I‚Äôm just wondering what people think, maybe if I should try to talk to him? I‚Äôm just scared to seem obsessive or something. And like it‚Äôd be so humiliating to be turned down again or make him uncomfortable. I‚Äôm just feeling a little lost about it and would love to hear some wisdom. 

And I get that the studying abroad is a big thing but I‚Äôm open to doing something shorter term, and I‚Äôm also fully open to and experienced with non-monogamy. Which he is aware of, I just didn‚Äôt suggest it in the moment cause I didn‚Äôt wanna seem pushy. I just feel like we‚Äôre denying and obvious connection and it sucks.

Also to any spiritual people, when I‚Äôve done tarot readings on this, I‚Äôve consistently been getting answers indicating that he‚Äôs interested and even saying that he regrets saying no",el_pg_el,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15gl1im/feeling_like_were_denying_a_true_connection/,1691012938.0,1.0

"Really confused I don't know what to even feel anymore. So I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now. She really loves me. I've been a fucked up overthinker since always and she has proved me wrong every single time. I love her too. I mean, idk man. I know i love her. I wanna take care of her. I love spending time with her. I love being physical with her. And every other thing. The thought of loosing her brakes my heart. But idk what to feel anymore. My first relationship ended badly. It's been like 3 or more years to it. I don't know if I'm still over it. Like look, I don't love her anymore (ex). I have no feelings whatsoever for her. But I'm not over the fact that i suffered so much during that period of time. Sometimes it's like i remember her and weep but it's actually me crying for myself that remembering the pain i went through. When it comes to now, i just came home from a beautiful date with my girlfriend. There were all romantic songs and shit. The moment was perfect. The thought hits me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to dedicate these songs for her because whenever these songs come up I remember my ex. Like i said I don't have any feelings for her like to that extent that even if she kisses someone else in front of me i wouldn't care. But I can't help but just think about her. And sometimes i feel like do I even love my girlfriend or is it just the truma I've been through that's holding me onto her. She's like a 6/10 (practical and realistically) but she's more than enough for me. When something happens and she's drifting away i do everything to get her back. The love is at the peak. But when she loves me too much i feel like eghh. I mean i feel good but idk man . I've had past relationships where i just abandoned them cause i felt the same and left out of guilt.

"Relationship of 4 yrs in crisis I am a 22M and i have a gf of same age .  We met in college first year and have been dating since then. 
Recently we got job placement in different cities and have started being involved in our lives , but we still manage to talk daily.

She made some new friends in her company have taken a flat with a couple of girls ,and a group of boys have taken the adjacent flat . The problem here is , she refuses to tell her friends that she is in a committed relationship. I feel that if she is spending so much time around them , she should atleast acknowledge our relationship to her close friends . Even after confronting her multiple times , that is making me  insecure , and she should atleast tell her close group of friends , she says this is non - negotiable for her and she cant tell anyone about us , coz she doesnt want them to gossip or be nosy about it. She has always been shy and isnt the most open person . 

My main concern here is that she has maintained restrictions for me , like not telling her parents or siblings about me  , and thats alright , coz her family isnt the most open minded . But she isnt hesitant to spend her entire day with those guys and is ok with telling her family about them , but is even hesitant to talk to me in front of anyone . I feel that all these 4 yrs i have adjusted with whatever she wanted like sometimes not talking for days at stretch when she went home , but at this stage , when she is living with her friends and has more physical as well as financial freedom , we should be spending more time together and not have constant fights on these stuff ,but she would never come to my place and she says that even if i go to her place , i woudnt be allowed to meet her friends and need to stay in a hotel . 

I trust her completely and my main issue is never her cheating , but her boundaries and restrictions for me , and if there are so many right now, whose to say in future she would be ready to fight for me against the society as we belong to different caste.

I am just being illogically paranoid ?

I (23M) matched with this girl (24F) on one of the dating apps a couple of days ago. The first date went really well and we already agreed on a second date.  
The issue: My only relationship so far has also been with a girl who was from Japan and now I'm worried that if I tell her, she may think that is why I'm into her (like a racial fetish or something). According to the likes I send on dating apps, the likes that go to women that, by the looks, have an origin in east asia matches the percentage of the population in my area. I am not a weeb, overly into anime or anything like that, it is really just a coincidence and I do genuinely like her.  
We already briefly talked about our experience with relationships in the past, but I did not mention it at this point. At the same time, I don't want to make the impression I'm hiding this fact from her. Should I casually mention this at some point?

"How do you all make the dating process less miserable &amp; exhausting? I (early 20sF) left a particularly tiring, complicated relationship almost two months ago and finally went back into the dating world. And, boy, I did not miss it one bit. 

I'm sure I have it better than a lot of people. I have options - tons of them. I'm currently using both Tinder and Bumble. I can't keep up with either app. This whole process is time consuming and so boring. 

If you're a woman, you probably have thousands of likes spread out through the apps or in just one; out of these thousands of likes, odds are you'll match with a few dozen people. And then the boring, early stage conversations start - what you like doing, where you live, what you do, etc. With every single person. It's mind-numbing. 

How can you possibly make this process less exhausting?

"How do I stop ending relationships to avoid getting hurt? I realized today that I want to find a girlfriend who will likely be my life partner.I need to get over something serious before I can start dating because I don't want to emotionally hurt anyone

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I get a new friend, or date someone, I see myself distancing from them in order to see if they care enough to chase me. Even to the point that I become cold in order to see if they will say something along the lines of ""Hey is everything okay"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really guilty about it, and something inside me tells me to do this in order to test if I am worthy enough to be someone's friend or boyfriend

&amp;#x200B;

It also stems from me fearing that this person is: using me, going to betray me, doesn't care about me, **will leave me** etc

&amp;#x200B;

I really need to get over this, because it's serious and affects my ability to form a close bond with someone. And I need to solve this issue because I can't have myself date a girl and then emotionally hurt her when my brain wants to distance from her in order to do a ""test"".

&amp;#x200B;

I promise I'm not a bad person, I genuinely want to get over this issue both for people I'm close to and myself.

"Am I (F26) overthinking the intentions of this new guy (M26) I‚Äôm seeing? So, I (F26) just ended a fling because I caught feelings and it was unrequited. The sex was great and the chemistry was just right but in the end this was all part of a casual arrangement.

Fast forward a few months later, I‚Äôve decided to gear towards more serious/ long term relationships. I was brought back to Tinder with this in mind and swiped. Matched with a guy(M26). Went on a few dates. Things are going well for me. The guy is really nice and do feel like the effort to see and maintain contact with each other is mutual. We‚Äôve been quite open to each other about past relationships, how they ended and what our intentions are.

From what he‚Äôs explained to me, he doesn‚Äôt want to jump into a relationship right away. He doesn‚Äôt know yet how he ultimately feels about me but he is not looking into anything casual. He just wants to take his time to decide whether he wants to date me seriously or not. 

I felt like it is fair to give him space and time to think about it. I‚Äôm not expecting him to move at my pace (yes I‚Äôm already attached to the man).

It‚Äôs also true that I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just going back to a situationship-type of involvement. We‚Äôve kissed already and not just innocent pecks. We‚Äôre talking flirtatiously to each other about things we wanna do. He didn‚Äôt turn me down when I suggested we go further than just kissing. But he‚Äôs still unsure about me.

I don‚Äôt wanna doubt him. He‚Äôs been forthcoming and gentle with me. He hasn‚Äôt shown any disagreeable personality traits. Even when I take a step back from kissing or I redirect his hand away, he waits until I initiate and doesn‚Äôt show any sign of annoyance. At the same time, I keep drawing parallels to my previous fling.

I keep bracing myself for rejection, expecting that this could all just be pleasantries and in the end my feelings will still end up unrequited.

"My generation just adopted the dumbest behavior in dating I hate how in my (27M) generation it became normalized and accepted to leave someone hanging in the middle of the conversation for day(s).

I am talking with 5 different women and all reply after a day. I am honestly starting to lose interest in people like them and see it as a red flag. It usually goes in two ways:

1. They remain ""interested"" and even if we have a date my expectations are on the floor. We cover super basic questions which we could have covered in text or usually on my profile, I leave after 30 mins. just to receive texts about when could we meet again. The first impression you made was that I am last on your priorities list and then didn't bother to look up 1 thing about me on my profile. Like hell no.
2. Even worse if they are not interested anymore but I still am. Then they just disappear leaving me to figure out if I said smth wrong, if they are busy, if I should text them again, etc. I did nothing wrong to them, why do people think leaving the other in this limbo is okay? If you cannot copy and paste a text of ""I am not feeling it"" then just unmatch ffs.

I am not joking, I have never been rejected in my life, well I have never been rejected properly!

I am done listening to this bs of ""they don't owe me anything"". Well, it seems like they did owe me a whole day of frustration in the end, which I didn't deserve, so what's up with that?

Before anyone says I shouldn't get attached to them, I get it, truly. However, as a guy, 99% of the time I put in all the effort to find things I like about them to ask interesting questions and guess what...I start liking them!

I truly don't get why they put the long-term relationship flair if their mentality is ""we will see how it is going"" and not the ""I want to get to know this guy to see if it would work or not""?

"I went with my gut and ended it ‚Äì but did I overreact? So I‚Äôve (24M) been talking to this girl (23F) for about 3-4 weeks now and decided to cut things off..here are the things I noticed along the way:

‚Ä¢I initially tried to set up a date for us by getting an idea of her availability and she just never gave a straight answer. However, she did let me know that she would go out for pickup soccer and would invite me out to play. And these invitations were kinda like ‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôll be if you want to come,‚Äù not like a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this together‚Äù invitation. 

‚Ä¢we went to the mall to pick out an outfit for her to wear to a concert (I did not pay, btw). By the time we were finished, I said that I was hungry and was gonna head to a restaurant to grab some food. She followed me there and we got our food. When we got outside, I found some tables for us and she said ‚ÄúOh, you wanted to eat?‚Äù This was confusing to me. I figured if you came all the way and got food with me that we‚Äôd eat together. After we sat down, she was glued to her phone, the communication was dry, and she hardly touched her food. She eventually apologized for being so distracted and mentioned that she was thinking of a guy she had previously ended things with who was moving away. I came to the conclusion that I was the rebound and stood up to leave. She stopped me, saying that‚Äôs not the case and that she wants a relationship, but she needs time. I held onto my skepticism and still decided to see how it went.

‚Ä¢From there, nothing really changed. I initiated most of our conversations. I found myself double-texting. Sometimes I‚Äôd get responses the next day like I wasn‚Äôt just ghosted the day before.

She went on a trip recently and hadn‚Äôt said anything to me the whole time. I just brushed it off as her wanting to focus on her vacay. I did speak to her once she got back and it was more of the same. Dry, one-word responses.

I finally said enough is enough and called it off, explaining that it felt like things were one-sided in both effort and communication. She said I was quick to judge and I told her she wasn‚Äôt quick to show me otherwise. Did I overreact? Did I not give things enough time?

"Being the initiator of a break up is always better than being broken up with. Not really advice just an opinion.

I'm not a great looking guy so I'm pretty used to rejection, especially when I'm very interested in a woman. I always know it's coming but of course I always hope I'm wrong (I never am of course) but as they say, it's the hope that kills you. So recently I was on the other side of things for the first time in a while. I was dating a woman who was more interested in me than I was in her. It wasn't a struggle to communicate, she put in effort, made herself available to date and basically was a joy to get to know. But I wasn't attracted enough to want to continue things..because of course that's how things would go. We went on 5 very good dates.

So I had to end things and I felt nerves because I didn't want to hurt her feelings, I can see why people want to avoid saying anything and Ghost people because they don't want to be mean but I quickly remembered how it feels to have my time wasted and strung along so I sent her a polite text that same day and that was that. 

But it got me to thinking how I would much rather be on this side than being the one getting rejected which is where I usually find myself and its not close when I think about how it feels to be rejected vs how it feels to have the control it's not even a competition.

How long should you wait to have sex when dating (particulary casually dating)? I know there is no real answer eveeyone is diffrent some ppl maybe be Christian for example in that case its years and years. Some ppl are shy some are not. I havent dated in years I went on dating apps as it Is really all I can use because I have stupid immigrant parents who dont want be to date. And all the guys even the really nice ones with good jobs who seem like a good option seem to push sex. I always tell guys before meeting them I will not have sex unless we are in a realtionship and they are not happy? I mean I get being horny when around somone attractive but what is the purpose of being on a dating app to find a partner is not? Idk maybe it's my city it seems all major cities have a horrible approach to dating and love. Polyampurous/open realtionship/casual/hanging out. I think they are looking for sex maybe and if the girl ends up being cool then might think about dating her. I just domy understand I'm not a prude I told them wr can do other things I will give them BJs. Idk I was told I dont know how to date I should take it one date at a time and be firm with my boundries and walk away if they wont respect them. I guesse so like I havent dated in years I know I dont know to date. I think I will continue with my rule of no sex unless in a realtionship however I think sometimes things  just happen and I think I should atleast get to know someone for a month not to fall in love or commitment just to see if they are a good perosn who I can trust who seems they would not cause me harm be honest and feel comfotable with at the least. The last guy I had sex with on the second date and the whole sitionship was a mess but It was really because I'm struggling with my life and substance use.

Its now wednesday and still no response. Am I overreacting and maybe she's just busy or have i been ghosted? Should i reach out again and ask or does that make me seem desperate?

"We finally kissed after 5 dates. Am I being hasty if I walk away after she said she‚Äôs processing things? I (M23) have been seeing this girl (F22) for a few weeks now (met on Bumble), and we‚Äôve been on 5 dates. Chemistry was there instantly, but she wanted to take things slow on date 2. I was okay with this. On date 3, I asked her what going slow looked like, which spiraled into her saying she‚Äôs not 100% if she‚Äôs ready for a relationship, but that she is dating to see. 

Fast forward to date 5, I asked her if she still liked the pace we were going at, which spurred another conversation about dating goals. We talked for hours about what we want. Suffice to say, we both agree we want to continue seeing each other, but she feels like she‚Äôd be leading me on if she‚Äôs not 100% sure what her long-term goal is. She says she could very well see a relationship come out of this, however. She admitted she‚Äôd been on a few other dates, none of which made it past date 1. She reassured me that there is a reason I made it to date 5 and no other guys made it to date 2. But she even said she‚Äôd be okay if I went on other dates. 

After we had that talk, we kept talking and returned to our normal conversations. Things got intimate, we started holding hands, and then we kissed. She admitted that was the first time she kissed someone in almost 3 years (and again I‚Äôm the first guys she‚Äôs been on several dates with in that same time). I feel like the kiss has complicated her feelings further. She texted me that she‚Äôs still processing everything, and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. I left the ball in her court by saying to take her time since I‚Äôm okay with going slow. But now I‚Äôm thinking I should just walk away and cut it off, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too irrational. Perhaps I should give her some time and space to figure it out it.

TL;DR: We finally kissed after 5 dates. The kiss happened after we had lengthy talks about dating goals. We both ideally want a serious relationship, but I‚Äôm definitely more ready than she is, as she‚Äôs unsure if she‚Äôs even ready to go down that path. I‚Äôm fine with taking it slow still. What do I make of this? I left the ball in her court. Perhaps she‚Äôs not into me, but I feel like me being the first guy she‚Äôs kissed and been on several dates in 3 years with has to count for something. She said she‚Äôs processing what happened,  but I may just walk away now. I‚Äôm unsure if not waiting for a response from her is too hasty, but I do want someone who is certain about me and what I have to offer.",-Leethul-,210,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fb6qy/we_finally_kissed_after_5_dates_am_i_being_hasty/,1690892925.0,0.92
"I feel like I have a lot going for me but am struggling in dating after the initial match/meet period Hi reddit, I'm hoping to hear some constructive feedback or advice from your experiences on some patterns I've noticed in my dating life and some of the struggles I've been dealing with lately that have left me feeling a bit frustrated/confused/sad about the whole process. I'm feeling ready to quit actively dating for a while. I appreciate your comments and letting me vent a little!

I'm 28 male and feel like I have a lot going for me. I'm a bit short and slight of build, but other than that, I have a good career, financial security, good friends, good family, personal interests, and while I'm no 10/10 I'm at least average or above average at looks I think, although I probably look younger than I really am. I think most people would say I'm a likeable person, I usually don't have trouble making friends if I want (I'm pretty introverted though so I don't always feel a need to make more meaningful friendships, especially as I've gotten older), and I'd say I'm very lucky to have been able to develop and maintain a lot of genuinely good non-romantic relationships with good people who have been in my life over the years. I don't always feel like a particularly smart person, but the most common kind of compliment I get in general is coming off as pretty smart and I do have confidence in my ability to figure things out usually.

I had a rough break up a little over two years ago and feel like the ensuing therapy and emotional rebuild time helped give me a lot of perspective and emotional maturation. It's made me feel more comfortable and confident about being direct in dating, skipping games, and communicating with others. I feel like I have my emotional wellbeing in a pretty good place, but I'll be the first to admit I have been and probably always will be a bit of a late bloomer in terms of life maturation. I think I'm the type of person though who will do it well once I get there slowly.

Admittedly, I don't have a ton of romantic relationship experience and dating has always been something I've felt was much more difficult than other aspects of my life: One serious relationship for about a year in my mid 20s, a semi-serious relationship for about 6 months before that in my early 20s, and two random hookups along the way where the woman did more of the initiating if we're being totally honest. I do feel like I learned a lot from the relationships I have had, though.

I've been trying to date with the goal of a good long-term relationship using hinge since about the beginning of spring. I don't really feel like I have trouble getting matches or turning conversations into first dates and sometimes second and third dates. I'm lucky in that sense and in the sense that usually the women I match with and end up meeting are doing pretty well themselves and strike me as smart and pretty. Rarely do the dates just feel like total duds, but the hard part is meeting someone to go beyond those first few dates with mutually.

Sometimes it's not meant to be and I've done my fair share of respectful rejecting as well as being rejected myself. I don't mind respectful rejection. Recently, I got rejected by someone I was a bit lukewarm on after a first date but willing to see what happens. She told me she felt more like friends than anything else, and that's always been a common theme in my dating life. Even back to when I had no idea what I was doing in high school, the most common way things have not worked out in dating has been essentially the friendzone. I don't really know how to deal with this realization at this point tbh. Obviously, I'm doing something wrong that that's a common theme, but I also think it's generally good for people to find you friendly, and that's a more natural part of my personality anyway.

I'm more sad about a different first date I recently went on. I thought it went really well and we had a lot in common. The conversation flowed and we talked about things beyond the typical superficial first date stuff. She told me to text soon about another date. I was honestly pretty excited about her. But then she ghosted me, so it's got me questioning my ability to evaluate my dates that go well or not and what I have felt like I can offer in dating in general. I was thinking of reaching out once more since I genuinely liked here and it's only been a few days, but when there's no response to me reaching out about another date the day after a first date, it kind of feels like that means no.

For those of you who may have had similar experiences in your dating journey or who have any advice to offer, I'd be very appreciative hearing it. Thanks!",OliveDragon7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15g99eb/i_feel_like_i_have_a_lot_going_for_me_but_am/,1690983717.0,1.0
"I'm not sure if I should be flattered or more depressed? So I (24m) took some new pictures and signed up for Plenty of Fish. I instantly got like 24 matches which is way more then I've ever gotten on any dating app.

Not even 4x days later I started talking to a woman and we planned to meetup. The day of the date comes and without going into details, she was nowhere near as attractive as her pictures (no offense). The conversations however was very nice.....until the end of the date.

She starts telling me about she almost offed herself and then tells me about how she pegged a guy for money......I never said anything even remotely sexual on the date mind you so this all came out of nowhere and rubbed me the wrong way. I was very uncomfortable at this point.

Anyways, I remained chill and walked her to her car. On my way home she immediately calls me and tells me about how I'd look good In a choker and cat ears and that she wants me to take naughty photos of her. Needless to say I never called, texted, or answered her calls again after that.

I'm genuinely not sure if I should be flattered or even more depressed. I've only ever had 3x gf's and I can't keep a girl for more than 2-3 months tops. I've been cheated on twice. I've only ever had sex once and that is a story even more embarrassing than this one. In all the years I've been using dating apps I've only ever had 2x actual dates and both of them were with women vastly more overweight than in their photos. The only upside to this date was that she was polite and a good conversationalist. The other chick was pretty mean to me.

So yeah, I honestly feel kinda emasculated that the first girl to show interest in me enough to go on a date just wanted to put cat ears on me and peg me.....",Awesometjgreen,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15g35qt/im_not_sure_if_i_should_be_flattered_or_more/,1690965226.0,0.86
"A woman's quality doesn't matter to most men You see a looooooot of discussions here where men lament the fact that women on OLD apps prioritise looks over quality when matching. There are sensible reasons why this happens in the OLD economy, but its understandable why guys would be a bit salty about it.

The thing is though, I almost never see any conversations where men discuss the quality of women when dating. Attractiveness and negative traits are all discussed, but you almost never see conversations where men value a woman for her intelligence / humour / hobbies / education / career success / etc.

This phenomena is most obvious when some men discuss ways to succeed in OLD. All you need is money, status and looks, and you can get all the women you'd ever want. Never mind that the kinds of women that would only care about these three things would be trash quality, the quality never mattered in the first place.

Men need to understand that there are a similar number of garbage women as there are garbage men. If you have any amount of self respect and actually care about having a meaningful relationship, you should not just consider what things would increase the quantity of women you can date, but also what things would increase the quality of women you can date.",JohnSmithTA,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fs8vq/a_womans_quality_doesnt_matter_to_most_men/,1690932230.0,0.74

"One of the worst situations I‚Äôve been in Okay so I know there‚Äôs gonna be no way to put this that makes me sound like a decent guy.

  So I‚Äôve been on and off with this girl for over a year and a half. We currently have an apartment. Everything has always been really rough between us. She always instigates arguments, hit me and spits in my face. She‚Äôs overall just a nasty person. Our last brake up she stole my dog and couches. Now I‚Äôm back with her bc she convinced me things would change. It‚Äôs been about 4 month and things are arguably worse.

   I went on a family cruise this past week. The day we left she chose to start a huge argument with me just over going (she‚Äôs known about the cruise since December). I brushed it off and went. Then before we even left port she was texting me saying that she‚Äôs going to the club and stuff while I was gone. 

   As soon as I saw that I mentally checked out of the relationship and treated myself like I was single on the cruise. Well I ended up meeting a girl. When I tell you that she‚Äôs my dream girl I promise I‚Äôm not over exaggerating. I ended up sleeping with her multiple during the cruise. She doesn‚Äôt know about my GF. 

But now I‚Äôm back home and I‚Äôm back with my girl. I tried dumping her but she wouldn‚Äôt let me leave. Just keeps saying she‚Äôs gonna do better.

"Could he (31m) still have feelings for me even though I (28f) stopped talking to him for 6 months? Ok so I've searched and searched on Google but I couldn't find anything relating specifically to my situation. Forewarning, This Is a Long Post. Ok so when I first moved to my new town, I (28f) ran into a guy (31m). We made small talk and then he surprised me by asking for my number. It started with him texting me constantly and always asking to hang out. I wouldn't respond much because I wasn't into him like that and I found it a bit overwhelming. at the time I didn't attribute this to anything romantic but as I started responding more and hanging out with him he revealed that he liked me. I told him I liked him as a friend and the next time we hung out he asked me to be his gf. I told him no but I liked our friendship so I still hung out with him.
He started to reveal personal things to me, like for instance how he had proposed to a girl in the past and she messed him over. 

Anyway I had been turning down his requests for me to come over and I told him I wasn't trying to get physical yet. But after a few more hang outs I let him miss me and that sparked something and we had sex. It was pretty nice, nice enough for me to change how I viewed him. He was also kind and generous with me. Again I have a hard time seeing romantic interest from men and I figured it was just a sec thing. So I always expected him to disappear. 

Next, he told me something that I found to be unforgivable at the time and I immediately told him we could no longer hang out. He kept texting me daily and I would ignore him. I would also see him around town and I would avoid him and not talk. I honestly felt like he could be a stalker but he never took it that far. 

Well after 4 months of not talking I heard through our social circle that he was moving to another state. So I sighed a breath of relief. Two months later I get another message from him and I decide to respond. Honestly from my post history you can see that I've been feeling low. But I also hold myself to a high standard and refuse to be with anyone just for the sake of being with someone. (I'm trying to wrap this up, I didn't realize I felt so deeply about this.) 

So we arranged a meet up and the connection was instant. We slept together again and it was better than I'd remembered. We spent the evening together and made plans to see each other soon. We ended up spending the weekend together and had an amazing time. The sex got even better and we found a lot of similar interests. I forgot to preface this by saying that his first language is Spanish and there's kind of language barrier but as I'm trying to learn Spanish it works out great. 

So the question i have is, what is happening here? I can't make sense of my newfound feelings for him and he's also not asking me to be his gf this time around. What does this mean? Also why didn't he let me go after 6 months of me not speaking to him. What was he holding on to. Any anecdotes, personal advice or stories would be great to hear. Thanks in advance.

"I want boring love It feels like I'm (36M) extremely alone in this.

Looking through OLD, (yes we all know it's bad) I can't help but notice that almost everyone wants to be ""swept of my feet"", to ""travel the world"", or they're ""Only here to find a babydaddy"". (Last one is usually not quite so direct) 

Everyone want someone to come along and change their life.

I just want someone to spend mine with. I want to wake up and have someone to smile at. I want to sit in the sofa reading or playing games together and/or apart. I want to take walks, talk about stupid things, cook together, help eachother when were sick or down. I want a partner, I don't want to be a travel agent, stand up comic, sp**m doner or acting prince charming.

Maybe it's a local thing, living in scandinavia, but I've gone through 5 different apps, looked at thousands of profile by now, had no matches all year (yes, OLD stinks but still) and I've seen maybe 10 women who are outdoorsy and have a life and might be interested in sharing it. But 99%, at ages 30 and up, still seem to think alcohol is a perfectly good hobby, making demands in their profile is a personality, having only pictures as a profile and still ""searching for serious commitment"" is a clever tactic and don't get me started on the instagram models fishing for likes.

I know there are tons of interesting and fun women out there. I know a whole bunch of them and many who are single. But where are the others? I cannot know all the interesting women in a 100km radius, that's just not possible.

"Went on two dates with an older man‚Ä¶ I started dating this guy I met at a pizza shop, and things have taken a strange turn. He's a 50-year-old personal trainer who mainly works with women and girl athletes. Initially, he didn't want to follow me on social media, so I waited and texted him later. On our first date, he discussed his ex-wife a lot, which I found inappropriate. He also assumed I wanted kids without asking and said, ""I know you're 23 and probably want to have kids, but I'm done‚Ä¶.""

On our second date, he made a joke about me googling him, so I did and discovered he follows women of different ages, including young ones, on Instagram. When I asked him about it, he claimed they were all clients, but his page has nothing related to fitness. I expressed my concern about a 50-year-old following a 12-year-old, and he didn't seem bothered.

Today, I plan to end things with him because during our conversation, he started criticizing my hairstyles and telling me what's appropriate for certain spaces. It made me uncomfortable, and I want to get away from him. He tried to justify it by saying he's trying to help me, but his reasoning felt irrelevant and controlling.

It took a long time to meet because we live a few hours apart and I was on vacation when we first started talking, then I got covid. But eventually we had a date and it was great. We explored a town we had never been to, held hands a lot, had lots of laughs, ate and sat on a bench and talked. Discussed future plans as well. There was no reason for me to believe she wasn't into me, which confuses me even more with the way she decided to block me.

A few days after the date we were texting about friends, and I stupidly asked ""Have you told any of your friends about me?"" and she replied ""Whoa slow down we only went on one date"". To which I replied ""Right, I havent told anyone about you either and I probably wont for a while"". And then almost right away as if she didnt even have to think about it, gave the generic ""you're a nice guy but we arent a good fit, best of luck"" message and blocked me before I could even respond.

"The internet has made dating strange (at times) I met my wife in an OLD dating forum and it was great..but now there‚Äôs too much information on the internet

But lately I‚Äôve had several dates show up with dossiers from information gathered on the internet and quiz me on our first dates.

Once while waiting for appetizers my date said ‚ÄúSo I was looking at your LinkedIn profile and blah blah‚Äù I said ‚Äúwell now that you‚Äôve seen my job history and how I present myself to future employers..‚Äù

Another had dug up several academic papers I had published 25 years ago and said ‚ÄúI read your paper on American eating habits and found it really interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù and then started asking me questions.. I had only vague memories and was reminded of the famous David Bowie quote ‚Äúthere are 1 or 2 records in my catalogue. I know I recorded them, but I had to go back and relearn the lyrics because I did so much cocaine during the 1970s I have no memories of the decade.

Why do they give me their number when they don't want to meet?

I asked some friends and they said the women want to have some smalltalk first, is that really true? I have never thought about that in any way, because why would you smalltalk online when you already know each other from real life?

"Is there any way to salvage this situation? Dear fellow dating subreddit members,

I hope this post finds you well.

I (25 M) went visiting a girl (28 F)who lives 3 hours away from me last week. it was our third date, and it lasted like 6 hours. We went for lunch and then for a walk. It was a pretty good time. But, for over 5 days, she didn't say anything. She was on vacation, granted, but I thought that it was quite weird, and started feeling insecure.

On day three, I send her a message to make ask how she was doing and to know if she was having a good time. She didn't say anything for two more days, so I thought that meant ""Ok, she was not interested"", so I sent her a message ""Hey, I hope you're doing well. I just got back home. I had a great time with you, and I was interested in getting to know you further. However, I understand you might not be interested, but I hope we can remain friends and perhaps hang out another time"".

Two days later she replied saying ""I was a little bit away from the phone, that's why I didn't say anything, but I hope you enoyed visiting this place, Take care!"".

I think I shot myself in the foot. If I had not been so anxious, I could've played it cold. 

Is there anything I can do, or can I salvage this situation at all? Even if it's just to remain friends. How long should I wait to contact her again?

"I saw somewhere that gay guys often are into guys similar to them... from my experience, it isn't true My body type is twink(in short it mean slim or slim-muscular), height 195, long hair, face rather avarage looking, 20 y o.

And why should I try relationship with someone who isn't attractive to me? Ohh and there is another thing. There is another important aspect in dating - your job or future job. Some people compensate their not attractive apperance by good earings so there are then couples like: rich ugly man and attractive poor woman.

During this time I was studying it was very stressful and he tried to come but got refused a visa. We‚Äôve had ups and downs,many arguments about him not giving me enough attention or not replying to my texts (I have bpd also)(and he likes to party). At some point he stopped asking for nudes of me and generally the whole sexual vibe disappeared.I brought it up and he said it‚Äôs because he is depressed and not in the mood. He always wanted to have an open relationship and I agreed cause it makes sense ,if you don‚Äôt see each other for few months ,but our terms were no dating and no emotional stuff. When I came back we didn‚Äôt have a lot of sex and I was going to bring this up to him that it feels weird at this point. The strange thing is that he kisses me all the time,always smiling,joking. He goes to the bathroom with me and he stays with me while I‚Äôm bathing, generally wants to spend all his time with me but not having sex and ofcourse I felt unwanted.
I found out yesterday that he
saw his ex lover 2 days before I came I guess to get the last sex for a bit out of his system.
He sent her the same nudes that he did to me. I saw a few very messages like I‚Äôm waiting for you at the station and etc. He asked her if his sleeping pills were there. Etc. I couldn‚Äôt really read through this I felt too ill. He was also on tinder and seeing other people as well. 
In the past I‚Äôve proposed breaking up few times and he was adamant that he loves me and wants to save our relationship. I don‚Äôt understand why he wants to keep me as it seems like he likes other people better than me and our relationship is difficult and inconvenient. I can see that I make him smile all the time and he is always touching me and kissing me. I don‚Äôt get it how you can do both at the same time? 
I confronted him and he said that he send his nudes as a joke in front of many other people and actually he didn‚Äôt sleep with her while we were together but if he did it would be his business. I don‚Äôt even know what to think and what to do. I can kind of understand some aspects of it but it still feels so disgusting. How is this my life? What should I do? My heart is in a million pieces.

"Am I the back up plan? I met a girl (call her S) about a month ago. S works at a bar I'm a regular at, and when we first met S looked me up on FB and slid into my dm's. 

Obviously this never happens, so I took it as a good sign. We flirted for a bit, talked over snap and what not. At one point sex came up, and I told her that I wanted to sleep with her. S gave me a very flirtatious smile and said she could tell, and that she liked me.

We kept talking everyday and after a week of this I asked her out. S gave a vague excuse about not being able to. I was pretty disappointed because I felt like we had a real connection, but I wasnt going to ask again. I have a rule about not asking twice, out of self respect. If a girl wants to go out but has other plans, she'll usually tell you why and be open to reschedule. 

S later messaged me again apologizing for being lame. I said it was fine and no big deal, we all have bad days.

S kept messaging me and whatnot, in a way that made it seem like she was still interested, so I directly asked is she was single. She said ""not quite.""

I told her it was cool and wished her luck, no hard feelings. I am fine with just being friends. I still go to that bar because I'm friends with the cook  and stuff, it's a friendly place.

She still acts like she's interested and tries to flirt with me, messages me on snap. Still wants to flirt and stuff. We talk about our passions and life ambitions, places we want to go and things we want to do.

So all this has gotten me to think she's using me for validation, trying to keep me as a backup man, or is genuinely interested and feels guilty about it.

What do you think?

Should I just ghost her on everything and find a new bar? Just try to be friends? She's fun to talk to and we get along pretty well.

"Me (29M) feels trapped with girlfriend (27F) Firstly, I acknowledge that I‚Äôm a piece of crap.

So the story begins, I get with a single mother a couple of years ago purely for ‚Äúfun‚Äù (mutually agreed).

Her ex boyfriend, and father of her kids ends his life out of jealousy (this guy already had another girlfriend and she was pregnant - so it wasn‚Äôt a case of her being unfaithful)

I then panic as she‚Äôs alone, has nobody, her family is awful. I decide to stay, but mainly out of guilt and the desire to help her through life. Not purely out of love.

A couple of years later, I always knew things weren‚Äôt right. I craved my own kids, I craved true love. The problem is, I didn‚Äôt have the heart the break things off.

Out of nowhere, I meet a girl who doesn‚Äôt have children, is absolutely beautiful and her personality was just out of this world amazing. And this is where I start a double life. 

It was evident that girl 2 was the one for me, however, every time I went to break it off with the first girl I basically turned suicidal with how guilty I felt about leaving girl 1 alone in this world, with her children. 

The other week, girl 2 found out that I had been on vacation with the girl 1 and she‚Äôs blocked me on everything. It feels like my heart, future, everything has been taken from me. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever love somebody how I do her.

"[28M] hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship in nearly a decade [28M] I haven‚Äôt had a gf since I was 20. Before that I never really dated much in school and I wouldn‚Äôt really count most of those experiences as real relationships. My last gf was my first for mostly all my experiences, but it didn‚Äôt last. Afterwards I spent a year on dating apps trying to put myself back out there. I was young and hurt, I didn‚Äôt really understand myself the way I do now. I‚Äôm not much of casual dater more of the relationship type, it takes a lot out of me to put myself out there and try and invest in a person, that‚Äôs something I found out about myself fairly recently. I say all that to tell you after one year of fully investing myself into dating apps, I got 0 results. No dates, no numbers, barely a notification. I was so miserable from the experience I gave up essentially, although if you ask me back then I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm taking a ‚Äúwhatever happens happens‚Äù approach. True of the matter is I gave up, I know that now. From then until I was 27 I had no interactions with women that weren‚Äôt familial, social, or platonic. It wasn‚Äôt until then that I realized that nobody‚Äôs gonna make a move or walk into my life, all those years were for nothing, I‚Äôm the only person who‚Äôs gonna have to make that happen. Afterwards I reinstalled some apps and gave it a try, and to my surprise I had some success. I got matches, went on a few dates, some ‚Äúthings‚Äù happened, but I was finally starting to feel normal. That being said nothing stuck and it takes a lot out of me still moving from one girl to the next. My last date was in January and after it I gave up again, but for a different reason. Looking back at those years I wasted I was a mess. No stable jobs, financial instability, didn‚Äôt take great care of myself, and wasn‚Äôt in a healthy headspace for most of it. I did learn a lot about myself though and most of my dating knowledge I researched and learned second hand. It took a bit to take accountability for my actions and to realize I‚Äôm in my position because of me. I‚Äôm the one who closed myself off from the dating market, it‚Äôs no woman‚Äôs fault that they aren‚Äôt dating me. It‚Äôs a start contrast to my late teens or early twenties when I had a more ‚Äúwhy not me‚Äù mindset, embarrassing as that is to admit. The reason I‚Äôm stopping dating this time is because I‚Äôm working on becoming a better me. The past year I finally landed a really good job, I decided to go back to school to pursue my degree, and I‚Äôve been working on my mental health. If I‚Äôm gonna really enter the dating market again I wanna be sure my finances and mind are both in good shape. With all that being said I still have my doubts. After nearly decade to myself the loneliness doesn‚Äôt get any easier and being so close to 30 I wonder how women in the dating market as a whole will interpret this massive gap in my dating history. I know I‚Äôm doing better then before but I can‚Äôt help but wonder sometimes.

The title kinda says it all but for context we have been friends for years. She had shown interest these last few months so I decided shoot my shot and give it a chance. She was super excited about it, to the point where she was going around telling everyone we worked with and showing them our texts and sharing the plans (just learned that recently and it was a bit of a red flag afterward.)  
  
I can't lie. I was pretty bummed when she canceled but i just conveyed that i understood and texted her if she wanted to reschedule. She ignored me. I texted her the next day about something work related and she responded to that. When I saw her at work next she acted like nothing happened and continues to keep flirting with me the same way she did before.   
  
I've been trying to ignore her and move on but she keeps popping up and reminding me of the situation. I've thought about addressing it with her but I don't think I'm gonna get a straight answer and us working together makes the situation kinda awkward.

"Met a girl I really like feel good and bad need advice Don't want to go into too much detail but this girl texted me on psn she showered me with attention and made me feel good about myself we got along and we were having fun. she told she had bulimia nervosa and she had been cheated on multiple times said no-one would love her, I also felt the same way that I was unworthy of love I got upset when she told me and she was not too happy that I got upset but I just felt compassion for what she told me and I cared about her that's why I cried.  
1 week later she got v distant ,and I started feeling nervous when talking to her, she randomly said why was i sending soo many hearts even tho she did the same we had a couple fights over similar things, she would inv random guys and flirt with them in the party chat then tell me in private chat that men being jealous turned her on? I said it was upsetting me and she kept doing it making out like I was being jealous and wierd, she Told me we weren't a thing and couldn't be because of the long distance said she just wanted to be friends. After a while she was on/off flirting in private but still making me sit in the party while she flirts and plays with other ppl.  
 So I backed off for a while I left her party chat that she was flirting with everyone in and she got mad said she didn't want to lose me. There were a couple times I went on and she was with someone else in the party and showed absolutely no interest in playing with me? I don't mind if she wants to play her own games or have her own friends but why does she not play with me? She knows I like zombies and cod and still she just plays and keeps picking up randoms all the time.   
Why did she say she loved me and I belonged to her ?  
How do i deal with this because I really like her and the group I'm in but I'm sick of her making me feel like shit to the point where I don't have a voice. We used to text but she doesnt reply to most of my messages she says she has a lot going on in her life but I feel v lonely and just want to hang out and feel loved by someone.

"Some days I could really just use a hug. So me.

53m DemiSapiosexual I was until a couple of years ago quite an active chap and had spent 47 years in IT and  10 years as a care provider for the Physically disabled. Now unfortunately and  they are still trying to determine the cause my lungs are severely damaged and only 42% functional.

I was married happily for 27 1/2 years to my ex who was physically disabled since birth, she is five years older than me. Unfortunately events conspired against us and and our marriage did not survive. We still get on really well as friends but can now never be anything more, Around 15 years ago she was diagnosed with hormonal breast cancer at level 2.48 on the NPI ( Nottingham Prognostic Index ), it was severe and aggressive, I was told that at 2.5 patients are advised to go home and write their will. 

I looked after her over those ten years while she underwent two full wide mastectomies, they were only going to do a lumpectomy but if they had and I hadn't managed to persuade her that breasts were not the be all and end all she would have died as while the foreground cancer had started at only 2.4mm in size it was 14mm a week later and there was a secondary outside the margins that was even more aggressive that would have been missed. While undergoing chemo therapy there were further complications and it was discovered that she was in heart failure after I forced her to go into hospital to get checked out.

To prevent the possibility of the cancers coming back she was put on a hormone blocker and that is when things changed drastically, the women I knew and loved completely changed, and due to changes in her body because of the hormone blockers intimacy of any type became unbearably painful and damaging, she couldn't handle that and decided that our marriage was over.

So while I have tried I have not been in a relationship between when she left and when I got ill.

Being who I am, I am not the type of individual to perform like a trained seal without I guess you would call it a shared connection and attraction so that cuts certain avenues. I don't find the thought of DIY appealing and that doesn't get around the feeling of wanting to be touched by someone who I care about and who cares about me..

"Guy I was seeing showed manipulative traits and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that there were red flags Rewriting this since the other one deleted while I was out with friends. This is intended more of a vent post than advice but it would be nice to get some feedback. I‚Äôve since moved on more from it but just wondering if it‚Äôs right to feel this way. Me (25f) and this guy (32m)(let‚Äôs call him Max) hit it off when we met at a vball meetup with his friends. He invited me on another occasion to watch movies. We connected so well conversationally and would pop by each others places and hang out. Mind you this has only been 6 weeks since we‚Äôve known each other but I hadn‚Äôt felt as attracted to someone in a long time. Fast forward, a few weeks later, I already realize he‚Äôs been seeing other people like he said but we had already slept with each other a handful of times. But one time I was too curious for my own good when he said he had ‚Äúplans that day‚Äù and I assumed it was a date. He tried to avoid that question but since I insisted he said that it was. That was fine but I wanted to confirm to him whether we were sexually exclusive or not. I had questioned him about it the previous day and he just told me he hadn‚Äôt been sleeping with anyone else and asked if I wanted to sleep with other dudes, to which I thought I was prodding so I avoided that question entirely. Anyways, he asked if I wanted to know the truth and I said ofc, and so he admitted that he actually hooked up with the other girl he was seeing seriously the previous night. I obviously felt shocked and emotional that week and getting back to town from work on that Monday, I still felt not so normal. I convinced myself that it was okay but he obviously saw this erratic behavior from my driving and asked if maybe something was off with me and things wouldn‚Äôt be working out. We worked through it because I hated conflict and he eventually turned the tables around on me. This is when he started interrogating the shit out of me. He asked whether I was actually telling the truth when I said to him I wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone. (I admit that I wasn‚Äôt fully truthful which is my mistake but I had only had one occurrence which I forgot about and one person that I wasn‚Äôt sure about going on a date with). I told him this and he told me I was dancing around the truth and said if I was lying, basically getting me to admit that I had lied. He kept at this with the questions because I guess he was trying to see what kind of person I was. Honestly I just felt defeated after the convo and we just resolved the discussion. Things were fine after but the arguments kept showing themselves.

One time I had a guy friend coming over to my place for Fourth of July and Max said he didn‚Äôt realize that it would be a slumber party and I said yeah well he‚Äôs probably just gonna sleep on the couch. And then he questioned me like ‚Äúprobably? Does that mean it‚Äôs a possibility he‚Äôll sleep on the bed?‚Äù I realized he went back to my words and scrutinized them, because I wasn‚Äôt saying to him that I was going to sleep with my friend ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I respect that the guy had boundaries but it felt interrogatory again. At that point I started to actively see other people since Max had been seeing the other girl and I didn‚Äôt want to get hurt. 

Fast forward to more recently, I realize we had a talk about boundaries at some point and how he was concerned about my dishonesty and promiscuity, since he knows about my flings in Brazil and my hookups in the past when I‚Äôm traveling. I don‚Äôt remember what I agreed to tbh but when I was in DC I specifically recall I asked him to tell me yes or no whether we were going to see other ppl or not, and he was just like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre free to do what you want but that will tell me the kind of person I‚Äôm considering dating‚Äù. Him and the other girl weren‚Äôt dating anymore but I didn‚Äôt want to keep myself still so vulnerable when I wasn‚Äôt even in a relationship with him. I didn‚Äôt get the answer I really expected and I seriously started having doubts about this even working.  

So I get it I went out with my friends, and he was wondering if they were girl friends and I said ‚Äúofc they‚Äôre the friends from Brazil why did you even ask‚Äù and he said he knows about the guys I hooked up with and he wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with that. I said okay, and this is when my friends told me he was being super controlling. I get that he has insecurities but it didn‚Äôt need to be displayed in this way. One time I sent him a photo of me in a sleeveless blouse and I later wanted to post it on IG and he commented that he liked I sent it to him but not that I posted it on IG. Like wtf? He saw that as attention seeking behavior and even though I said it was normal to post things you feel good in, he said some girls wouldn‚Äôt do that. Also he got really upset telling me how I didn‚Äôt text back at the end of the night and that we agreed for me to check in with him. I explained to him that I wanted to have a fun night out and didn‚Äôt realize this. I do admit that these behaviors had caused me to just not like the relationship and I already had a bit of bitterness over his hookup. I kissed someone that night but never slept with anyone during that time. A few days later, I brought up us not working out and he started to bring up reasons then of us not working out. When I admitted to him about the kiss, that was his excuse for not seeing me as gf material. It didn‚Äôt matter that he slept with another girl because he said that someone I‚Äôm seeing seriously is fine, but someone who sees others casually isn‚Äôt the type of person he sees himself with. He still wanted to remain friends after we had finished and we wanted to resume talking the next day but I was late to the call and I admit that I wasn‚Äôt making it easy, so he got upset and didn‚Äôt talk to me until the next day. I later apologized and he told me how I wasn‚Äôt respecting his time etc etc. I apologized and he acknowledged it and said as much as he wanted these things to be good btwn us that he can‚Äôt be with someone so dangerous‚Ä¶ lol And this is when I blew up. 

I told him over text about all the reasons in his shady behavior, about placing this double standard on me, to asking me to be exclusive if he really wanted me to act like a gf. My friend was in full agreement that what I had said was mature and good. I kind of wanted to just stop texting there but he sent me a couple texts that I couldn‚Äôt ignore the next two days. When I opened it thinking he understood, he said he agrees to most of it but again it isn‚Äôt reflective of some of our conversations, and that he doesn‚Äôt want to repeat himself and that he doesn‚Äôt want someone who sleeps around so casually, who is distrustful, who acts like a princess without contributing to much, etc. but that he sees the good qualities in me. At this point I went off on him, like I never slept with anyone while seeing him. But he called them ‚Äúobjective behaviors‚Äù. Also, how can he call someone distrustful if we were to remain friends? Anyways, we decided on maybe speaking about this in person when I got back. But I‚Äôm just avoiding this convo altogether atm and not getting back to him yet because I honestly don‚Äôt think it will resolve anything. I don‚Äôt know how this can be really repaired to a friendship either. It‚Äôs like a do it or die situation where in the end I‚Äôll have to submit to what he says. And that‚Äôs not a behavior I admire either",Annual_Big_6878,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15g76fm/guy_i_was_seeing_showed_manipulative_traits_and_i/,1690978004.0,1.0
"Advice on how to meet women Hello Reddit/dating 

Ive been using dating apps for the last 6 months in my city (5 million people) and have used the apps for the last 10 years of my life and have had short and long term relationships. 

Ive recently noticed that im not seeing anyone or talking to anyone who seems to be someone I might have a connection with. Ive been on some really bad dates as well.

I do however see women on the street, in venues, at work, in shops, on public transport that look like we might share similar interests, but its a socially unacceptable to approach them and start conversations and try to meet someone you havent been introduced to IMO.

I dont drink, but I go to venues and see live music. This seems like it could be a place to meet women, but I dont feel comfortable approaching anyone because of how unsafe women say they feel at these places. 

All of my friends are either single and in the same situation as me, or in a relationship and all of their friends are couples. 

How are people meeting each other in 2023? Is there something else I should be doing like meet up groups? Speed dating? 

I just turned 40 and Im not quite sure what to do besides just live my life and hope someone introduces me to someone one day, im out of ideas.

"Feeling excited. Finally have a date planned today! I (42M) have been single for a year and my last relationship was rater platonic. It lasted 3 years but I was not in love (nor was she). We were both very different and she was 10 years older than me.

I have not tried to go back on the dating scene, nor felt the urge to do so this last year. I am a geek/nerd and I have no kids. I have had my fair share of relationships, but I ain't the alpha male most girls look for. I am rather thin and have long hair....

Then someone fell off from the sky!

I am a chef on a beach side restaurant with an opened kitchen. So last friday a woman was trying to grab my attention and when I went to speak to her, she explains that we met a few years back and we were with mutual friends and that she remembers that I was good with computers. She goes on and explains that she just bought a PS4 and she is trying to hook up the sound to her sound system.... I explained to her that she needs to get that special card and tell her where she can get it. She then proceeds to give me her number telling me she'd rather I come to her place to set it up....

I went and got the part for her on saturday and sunday after work I finally went to her place. I successfully installed it and we chatted and had a few drinks. Found out we are the same age, only a few months apart, and have similar lifestyle. She has no kids, love to game, love to trek... She is amazingly pretty, I would have never thought she was over 40, I gave her 35....

Anyways she proceeds to say that she got the ps4 so she could hang out with friends and play but none seem interested. I proposed to play a bit with her right there but she said she is not feeling well because she is on her periods... But she would probably feel better in a couple of days...

So we organised to meet on my day off, wednesday, today! I am bringing in my switch, a few drinks for an all afternoon of fun time lol! It really feel like she fell off from the sky. No matter the outcome of the date, I am thankful just for the excitement it brings. haven't felt that way since my 20s/30s....

Although I took enough time to resolve issues and also gave her enough chances to change, I'm stuck in that loop where I'm thinking should I have taken more time before breaking up? Was I impulsive in taking this decision? I'm not able to think clearly and I need help.

"Was she actually on a dating app to look for friends only? She said she‚Äôs looking for friends only after turning down a kiss on our third ‚Äúdate‚Äù 

Now normally I would get the idea and understand that she just doesn‚Äôt want to date me for whatever reason but there‚Äôs a lot more mixed signals that have me wondering - did she just lose interest or was she genuinely on hinge to make friends?

Context/ demographics: I‚Äôm a 24 year old guy, grad student. She‚Äôs also 24, works as a journalist and moved here from India and got out of a relationship about 5 months ago- we‚Äôve both been living in the same city for a year. 

So we talked for a couple weeks and the conversation was nice and while I tried to make it flirty here and there she was generally pretty reserved - and then we met in person. I planned the perfect picnic and paint date and it was honestly going so well, like I know when things are awkwardly friendly or whatever and while there were some pauses it generally felt pretty good. Fast forward a week, and we‚Äôre still talking like any other girl I‚Äôve talked with in the past so it all seems okay - we go on a second date and we do something I wanted to do, and something she wanted to do and i think I mention pretty explicitly that this is a date which she seemed pretty okay with. And then SHE proposes that we hang out again the next day and again it‚Äôs pretty much it‚Äôs her idea
. Overall I‚Äôm feeling pretty excited about her because thats three dates - but the big hang up is that she‚Äôs been extremely shy - but she made it pretty clear that‚Äôs how she is in general so I don‚Äôt try to initiate much because I want to respect that. 
Anyway the day goes by aright but at the end of this date I ask for a kiss pretty straight up and she basically says that she thought we were both under the impression that we were just friends. However never did she verbalize this, and I just feel pretty led on by her for no reason. She mentioned how her therapist told her that she‚Äôs not ready yet after getting out of a relationship and that she would rather be friends. I responded well and just said oh I think I‚Äôm looking for something real but wish her the best etc. 
but the question for me is wether this was genuine or was she just saying that because she didn‚Äôt like me. But why ask for a date the next day after our second one if she didn‚Äôt want to spend time together.

"AITAH for not paying the whole double date? So I m(23) matched with Tanya (f20) on tinder a few weeks ago. Since us matching we have Called and texted all the time and we planned to go on a cute date. So, she said she was extremely excited also nervous so she suggested if she could bring her 2 friends who are dating each other. I agreed and said no problem. We agreed to go to a mini golf/ arcades with a bar and nice restaurant, we met her 2 friends there (Lydia &amp; Erin). The night was going great, drinks and conversation was flowing and the food was delicious. So, it comes time to pay. We had racked up a pretty hefty bill and as the waiter asked how we wanted to pay I said I will pay for myself and Tanya. Oh boy did this outrage her 2 friends, as soon as I said this they hurled abuse and insults at me. Calling me broke and a misogynist for not paying the whole thing, I replied back I‚Äôm not paying for you two as you two are not my date.

"How long should I wait before I tell him my feelings? For context, I am F16 and he's M18. I live in Asia, whereas he lives in Europe so we haven't met each other irl. Tbh, we just met 2 weeks ago on reddit then eventually  moved to insta, and have been texting each other everyday for hours. Yesterday, we finally called each other for the first time and spent 7 hours playing games and plainly just talking. 

This seems far-fetched but I think I'm starting to like him romantically. During the short time we have talked to each other, we had already opened up ourselves to each other about our private lives. Thus, I know that he wouldn't hit on me unless I tell him I like him. But the thing is, I'm also confused whether he's just genuinely incredibly nice, or he atleast feels something for me.

I have been thinking a lot about my feelings in this matter, and our compatability. I know that if he feels the same way as I do, we both can manage a long distance relationship. And if not, and only sees me as a friend, I'm 99% sure that our friendship would not be affected by me telling him I like him. 

Still, I want to ask on when will be the right time to tell him that I like him? I'm honestly scared that if I did it too late, he might be dating someone else by then.

Her parents are welcoming me to their home and eating together. I honestly thought all was well. This 1 date we had was the deal breaker for I guess. I honestly don't know specifically what I did or say but I have my theories about it. I thought they were harmless just to get the conversation going or have fun. 

I found an excuse to touch her hand. There was a bit of an awkward silence after that. I ask her questions about us. And hypothetical scenarios like what if someone else was entertaining her. I asked if she found any red flags she found. I took a candid picture of her. I said "" who am I to complain "" when she said sorry 3 times and wanted to skip dinner because she was suddenly I'll and tired. 

I wish I knew those were deal breakers for her. She said it was just our personalities and she found no connection between us. I am not sure if it was true or not. Anyways, I blew it anyway. Just have to accept thinks as they are.

"Is this situation heading towards something more serious like an actual relationship? I (25m) and my partner (23f) were classmates in grad school and oddly enough matched on OLD and started speaking from there. At first she was apprehensive about us as classmates dating or being intimate. We continued talking however and a little less than a month later, she asked me out to a drink after class one evening and that began the whole experience. From there, she came over to my house, we went on a walk and watched a movie but also slept together that day. 

From that point on, we would hang out 1-2 times a week and usually slept together every time. Of course we would go out to site see, go on walks and actually do things together that aren‚Äôt just sex. As time went on over a few months, it shifted from less of fwb vibes to us acting much more like a couple and a more significant attachment and connection growing and growing. Even while I traveled for a bit this summer, we stayed in touch and would video call on several occasions. It was during one of those trips that we both acknowledged that we like each other (as in like-like) and since then, multiple discussions have happened. 

A caveat on this is however that she has a disorganized or fearful avoidant attachment style (I am predominately secure style) and tends to put up barriers or obstacles up to keep people from being too close to her. Each time something more serious has been discussed, some different reason for it not being that has been stated. It was basically a different reason or different variation of a reason every time. Most recently it was that she (she is bi, she for a while thought she only liked women, which I‚Äôm supportive of, I like her for her) feels like she doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúmiss out‚Äù on dating women, but very much wishes to keep dating me. I think we both realize that something more serious between us is looming here. 

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe or trust what she says when she brings up obstacles or barriers, but it feels like a lot of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and trying to find reasons. Despite this, each time and progressively more so the longer we‚Äôve seen each other, we constitently act and are closer and closer. We have pretty much mutually admitted we‚Äôre both interested in more seriously dating, and we both are monogamous people. She has however had some reservations about it and those reservations seem to coincide with some of the barriers and obstacles she has mentioned as part of her avoidant attachment style (which she acknowledges). 

We are going on a trip together soon and it will be just us. She is also accepting of romantic gestures and even does some herself and doesn‚Äôt reject romantic gestures or efforts. My question is what direction this is going? I can clarify any questions and am happy to provide any details too.

"I like my sister‚Äôs friend. Does she like me too? My (M26) sister first met this friend (F24) at school about 10 years ago and they‚Äôve been close ever since. Obviously I‚Äôve met her on numerous occasions over that time be it at school or when she would come over to our house and we‚Äôve always gotten on well. She‚Äôs always enthusiastically smiled and waved at me whenever I‚Äôve seen her, including when I would pick my sister up from her house. However, I‚Äôve also always found her very good looking, though I‚Äôve never said anything about it to either her or my sister.

Lately though, our interaction online has been steadily increasing. When I created my Instagram account about eight years ago, she was one of the first people to follow me and of course I followed her back. Over that time, she sometimes liked my posts and vice versa at various intervals, but recently it‚Äôs become more frequent to the point where she‚Äôs basically been liking every time I‚Äôve posted. Of the 14 IG posts I‚Äôve uploaded since the start of last year, she‚Äôs liked 13 of them (the one she didn‚Äôt like was the one that wasn‚Äôt about me; a tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth). It was my birthday a few weeks ago too and, for the first time ever, she DMed me to wish me happy birthday. This is not something that either of us had done for the other before.

Since January, she and my sister have been sharing a flat together in London (though I have not yet had the chance to visit) so I don‚Äôt know how much of that has anything to do with it or whether they‚Äôre subtle signs of mutual affection, or even whether I‚Äôm just overthinking this whole thing and it means nothing? There‚Äôs also a chance that my sister will soon be put on a placement in Munich for several months, leaving her friend behind, and I have several trips to London coming up anyway, so if my sister does get the placement, I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs worth messaging the friend and asking her to meet up while I‚Äôm around?

Within the first 5 minutes of sitting down and seeing the menu he said ‚Äúthis place is expensive‚Äù with an annoyed tone and face.

"My ex-GF(34F) refuses to tell her male roomie that I(25M) am in a relationship with her. Was I wrong for breaking up? The girl I've been dating long-distance for a couple of months refuses to tell her male roomie that we are together, and I decided to break up over it. Was I wrong?

  
This all started months ago when she told me the story about him. A couple of years ago, after a breakup, she decided to move in with a guy she knew was interested and she hoped it could work out. He turned out to be very weird and she didn't want to start a relationship with him after all, but she had to keep living with him because she couldn't find a new place to stay. Either it was really shitty or super expensive. They've been living together for 3 years. I accepted it and thought nothing of it. She has told me he is an incredibly jealous person who becomes angry over the smallest things, thus she could not tell him we were together. She said she would find a new place to stay, and then tell him.  


  
We are dating long distance, and this week she had planned to go on a trip with him to my country. This was planned before we got together.We only see each other once a month, and I thought it would be nice to be able to see each other. I suggest we could meetup, but she said it would be impossible to meet without the guy. He described him as so dependent that he would follow her everywhere. She couldn't even go for an evening walk without him joining. I then suggested we meet with the guy and just pretend to be friends, so that I could get to atleast see her. She said that was a cute idea and I went along with.

  
Until the date came closer and I started feeling really shitty about it.... why do I have to pretend to a random roomie that we are not together? How angry can he possibly become so as to hide our relationship from him, but at the same time she goes on holiday with him for multiple weeks?

  
A couple days before we would meet I told her I feel frustrated about the situation and I have no idea why this has to happen. She said she is frustrated too, and that it feels weird from the outside, but now it is too late. She has lied to him about where we had met, and lied to him continuously in the past when she went on trips to my place. She would for example say that she was visiting family in her home country, and then fly over to my country instead.

  
The date came and I started telling my friends about the situation. Everyone around me has described this as a massive red flag. When she landed I told her we have to talk, and I asked her if she is together with the guy or what is going on. I got a crying voice message in response where she told me I had basically ruined her whole holiday in a matter of seconds. She had always been honest with me about him, and she couldn't believe I accused her of cheating and lying. I said my question was never intended to hurt her, but this whole situation is extremely weird and I can't comprehend it. I need clarification.

  
She said that this is my issue, not hers. That I have issues and my insecurities are messing with my mind. Suddenly confronting her and ""exploding"" on her was exactly what she grew up with and she can't be with someone who triggers all her trauma like that. I again said that it was never my intention to be mean, but my mind changed about pretending we were friends, and the whole thing felt crappy.

  
I started talking more and more to people around me, and everyone keeps saying I am borderline being manipulated and that these are huge red flags over and over. My mind feels like mud. I have no idea if I am at fault or if I did anything wrong.  


  
After some thinking, I decided to end things. I told her that even if she was together with the guy or not, to be called an insecure, problematic person she can't help by bringing up such a question is extremely over the line and I will not allow someone to treat me that way. I blocked her on social media and said she could reach out to me by mail.  


  
After I blocked her I got a super long message from her best friend trying to explain the situation. She said that the guy is an incredibly jealous person, who she has gone on holiday with multiple times and known for several years. He would become jealous over the smallest of things, and if my ex upset her, he would be impossible to live with. The best-friend told me it was not fair to treat my ex this way.

  
My mind feels so incredibly torn over this. On the one hand, I think most people would find this situation extremely weird. Traveling on a mulitple week holiday with an ""emotional tyrant"" who cannot know about us, and who is hell to live with. On the other hand, I can see how I shouldn't have confronted her so directly right before meeting me, but was it really such a harsh question to ask?",ThrowRA_RoomieDoomie,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fbvg5/my_exgf34f_refuses_to_tell_her_male_roomie_that/,1690894646.0,0.86
"I don't know if i should break up with my boyfriend For context, My boyfriend used to have a terrible mental health and he has frequently mental breakdowns, he depends emotionally on me, he told me that he is possessive with me because he doesn't want me to go like everyone else in his life did

Today I was on a call with him and he told me to talk about my Russian ex so i didn't mind but i couldn't tell the truth about what happened in that relationship (That Russian ex he was talking about is a Girl, So i was in a girl x girl relationship) the issue is that he's homophobic and very mentally closed
so to tell him what kind of happened i lied and told him that my ex it was a boy
everything was going perfectly but then i used the pronoun ""she"" by accident referring to my ex, My boyfriend said ""SHE, wasn't he was a man?"" so i was in pure panic and i didn't wanted him to see me as a liar so i told him ""yeah.. when she and i were dating she used to use a masculine pronouns, but then 2 months after se changed her pronouns to feminine ones, and i know i ain't talking to her but i want to respect their pronouns correctly""
then we were at a total silent until he 
""no.. no no no i can't believe you're actually gay, please tell me it isn't true"" (and I repeated the story that I had told him before about her pronouns).. 
later he told me he was very disappointed on me and he was in ""shock"", i crearly got upset and he actually noticed and started to say ""No no no i didn't meant it like that it's just.. i didn't.. how would i.. i'm really sorry and i didn't wanted to make you upset, i know you aren't gay i just thought that maybe you used to be one, i know that's not the case and i love you no matter what""

i was thinking to tell him i'm a part of LGBTQ+ (Omnisexual) some time ago, but i don't think our relationship is strong enough. we frequently fight, every time i try to talk about breaking up, He tells me that he can't see a future without me and that he only wants me in his life, he doesn't care what happens or in what circumstances he is, he just wants me in his life, he once told me ""if you walk away from me, i will blame myself all my life and most likely I will never forgive myself and end up going into depression or even committing suicide But if we are together we can fix these things""

I don't know what to do, he has let me down so many times but he just treats me so well, and i truly believe he loves me and he's trying to make a difference in his life, and his first girlfriend so i want to understand him

"No luck dating, need help understanding 

I am a male Asian person of Chinese descent in my mid 30s, currently in Lincoln , Nebraska. I've been on dating apps for about 6 years now, I've lived here over a decade, great career with a 6 figure salary, normal BMI , definitely no Brad Pitt physique but I work out almost every day.


I've read that generally Asian men are less popular when it comes to dating, I've had a grand total of 2 matches across my apps, with both of them attempting to get me to subscribe to some fishy website or invest in a ""side gig"" of theirs.


I've tried speed dating, meetups, but not bars(not my thing) and I've never made it far enough to draw any interest to earn a date.


Am I screwed because I'm an Asian guy in the Midwest? 


Are there any Midwest states that are more welcoming for Asian men?

she told me in person that she has ADHD , she didnt tell me she is diagnosed with it though but i believe her of course !

"How do you ask a fwb that you want a relationship with them and want to be exclusive? So, I‚Äôve had a fwb for three and a half years now. When we first started in march 2020, it was just for sex and intimacy. And it started off rocky. I(37f) blocked him (46m) a few times because I thought things were moving too fast and I wasn‚Äôt ready. I was also married when we originally met but divorced three months later. 

Over the last year and a half, or a little longer, we have been talking almost every day. We both work in the casino industry but in different departments and different casinos in our area. We live a mile from each other. He rents his place, I own mine. We also have been meeting, or trying to meet, once every one or two weeks. I‚Äôve taken food to his place after work and we‚Äôve watched movies and hung out as friends. 

Recently though, like the last six or seven months, I‚Äôve been developing feelings for him. He‚Äôs a really nice guy, had two grown children who are in their late 20‚Äôs, he‚Äôs very close with his daughter and I will never come between the two (I was very close with my dad). We‚Äôve been to concerts together, I‚Äôve stayed the night at his place, he has pics of me in lingerie on his phone and one day messaged me to say he was looking at the pics and was getting aroused. 

Here‚Äôs the thing - I don‚Äôt know how to tell him how I feel and that I want a relationship. I‚Äôve only ever had one relationship in my life before him, and that was with my ex husband.

Basically I‚Äôm very shy and haven‚Äôt dated anyone until now. My bf however have dated many and have a lot of experience in the bedroom. I‚Äôm not like the kind to ‚Äúwait til marriage‚Äù kind of person, I‚Äôm just new to this stuff. 

We‚Äôve talked about having sex and losing my virginity to him before. I‚Äôm actually looking forward to it as all this is new and exciting to me. We haven‚Äôt gone all the way yet but I have given him blowjobs so far. In the middle of our conversation about such topic, he expressed how he‚Äôs interested in wanting to try threesome/swinging/cuckolding.

"He is having long-term plans with me but also treating me not as well as the girls he used to date. Should I end it? I (33F) have been dating this guy (31M) for almost two months after meeting through a dating app. We are both looking for serious LTR and are exclusive (he popped the question). Things have been going quite well - we did a short trip to a nearby city and are planning on a four day trip to NYC. And he‚Äôs been hinting at being official, which I have been dodging because there‚Äôs something really bothering me about him. 

He‚Äôs told me about the girls that he used to date and how nicely he treated them, well, better than what I‚Äôve got. There‚Äôre things like he bought $200 ballet tickets for a girl who broke things off with him before that planned date. And he told me about the girls that he drove an hour to see and was chauffeuring around for them. But today he suggested going to a zoo (metro accessible, free) instead of an aquarium (an hour drive, $50 ticket each) that we initially planned on going. And one time when he drove me he told me how much he hates driving. 

So here‚Äôs some contexts: his job pays him decently like 170k at least, I make a little less than that. But he‚Äôs very frugal about most things because it sounds like his parents haven‚Äôt been doing great financially (family income eligible for college grants) but they also didn‚Äôt bother to fill in the form for grants application for him until the last year. So he worked really hard to pay off his student loans during college, like falling asleep behind the wheels from working and studying. 

As a result, he missed out on all the socializing in college and is a bit socially awkward - yes, not great at pulling girls obviously. He‚Äôs only dated two girls for longer than a month other than me.

I don‚Äôt mind his lack of game and actually quite like it after being burned by many ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù guys. And he told me that before he met me he was doubting why he moved to our city for a better chance of finding someone. But I can‚Äôt get over the fact that he‚Äôs not made an effort as he did for other people. 

Growing up my parents gave me the best they could so my love language to others is gift giving and acts of service. I just took him to dinner at restaurant that has $$$ on Google map.

"32M My take on any given man‚Äôs likelihood to cheat and questions for women. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that MOST men that women consider attractive, when presented with an opportunity to cheat on their partner with a woman of equal or greater attraction, would AT LEAST seriously consider it. If a man knows women find him attractive and he knows he has the ability to cheat there‚Äôs a good chance he will. Why wouldn‚Äôt he? Women don‚Äôt seem discouraged this behavior. In fact I think women want a man that‚Äôs a cheater, because it shows his ability to attract a partner and that he is to be sought after. To all the women who claim to be jaded and distrustful of men why not just date a slightly less attractive man? Most women claim at least that physical attraction isn‚Äôt the most important thing in a relationship, so why not settle?

"Am wasting my time? Need some advice about a girl I like

So here we go
I‚Äôve known this girl for over a year now, we are good friends, we talk about pretty much everything including our dating and previous sex lives and we have always had a flirty friendship to the extent of her flashing me on occasions, I‚Äôve had a bit of a thing for her since we met but she has always been unavailable, in one relationship or another

Just over a month ago I was driving her home after a night out with mutual friends, and I had to pick my daughter up from a party, I was sober and she had a few drinks 

We were chatting while I was driving and I proceeded to ask her how her current hook up was going, she had been seeing a guy not very regularly that she met online, she told me she hadn‚Äôt seen him in a while, she asked me how I was getting on and I told her that I couldn‚Äôt be bothered looking anymore to which she asked me when the last time I hooked up with someone was and I said it was before covid, her reply was well if you didn‚Äôt have to pick your daughter up we could have hooked up tonight, we both started laughing 

So we get to where I was picking my daughter up and she was pretty drunk so I had to take her home before driving the girl home, she was cool with that
Dropped my daughter off and got her into bed then proceeded to drive the girl home

We carried on a normal conversation and we get to a set of lights where she tells me to turn left she wants to show me the river, her house was to the right

I turn left and we drive to the river where we continue to talk, the way she was looking at me I knew she wanted more, I asked to kiss her which she says yes to but then says nothing more, she didn‚Äôt want anything to threaten our friendship, while we were kissing she guided my hand all over her body, I let her take the lead on everything we were doing

I suggested going in the backseat of the car and we ended up having sex

While driving her home afterwards she was still very flirty and we kissed when she got home 

The next day we were messaging all day telling each other how much fun it was and telling each other what we liked and what we wanted to do to each other

This carried on for a few days but we never managed to meet up as we were both working then out of the blue she said that it was a mistake and it won‚Äôt happen again as she didn‚Äôt want to jeopardise our friendship
I tried talking to her about it saying it would only bring us closer but she shut me down

We were out at the weekend with mutual friends again and the flirting has started back up again

"Phenomenon ive noticed in dating regarding height So something I've noticed regarding dating and height in relationships is that while the overwhelming majority of women prefer men taller than them. From what I've seen taller women 5'7 and above care significantly less about height than really short women. In fact I've seen a sizable amount of tall woman be in relationships with men shorter than them. I have a cousin in a relationship with a girl 6 inches taller than him. While this is cool. 

 I  find it very interesting because we often assume that because many many short girls are extremely picky with height. Taller girls would be even more picky and stringent.

"People Exaggerate Public Interactions. People Online Exagerate how Common it is for People to Interact with Random Strangers

People on reddit seem to love to exagerate just how common it is for people to chat up strangers in public. In grocery stores, the street, public parks, etc. Generally conversations only happen when it makes sense for them to, and that isnt often. Im not talking about 2 second interactions with old men asking how are you or commenting on the weather and you responsing politely as they walk by.

A lot of the times people try to tell others how conversations with people in public go they just say an opener(usually a strange one) and hand wave the actual conversation from that point.

"Are they into me? I (21m) have this new coworker (44f) who just started about a month ago.  I ended up sitting next to her at a lunch meeting being held to welcome some new people to the company (her included). 
We said introductions around the table and then we all broke off into our more private conversations with those around ourselves. 
Seeing as she was sitting directly across from me we ended up chatting throughout the lunch; mostly about the food and joining in on other topics being discussed in our vicinity. 
We both are pretty obvious introverts and so I feel we ended up sharing several nervous ""glances"" as others were speaking (as introverts do).
Nothing too crazy to begin with. 

The following week we had another lunch meeting for all of the month's birthdays. Again we ended up sitting next to each other and sharing conversation. 
As birthdays was a big topic, she asked me my age.
This is something I've tried to keep hushed throughout the office as I have had bad experiences in past jobs with people treating me like a child due to my youth. But as I had my 21st birthday the previous month, pretty much the entire office had heard.
When I told her, she said ""wow you're like the baby of the office"".
I didn't take much offense to this comment as I don't think she meant anything negative by it and I'm used to the other women in the office being a bit ""motherly"" towards me.

As time has gone on, she seems to be taking greater and greater interest in me. She seems to go out of her way to come over to my desk and talk with me. Our cubicles are on opposite ends of the office, and though the printer is near my desk, it is still far enough away that using the printer isn't a good excuse for coming to see me.
She's started asking about my hobbies, where I live, how long I've been with the company - pretty typical topics. 

She's also started leaving through the door right next to my desk as opposed to the one closer to hers. The other day she asked me to walk her to her car because the hallway to the parking lot was dark.
And she has been walking by throughout the day to peek at me through the plexiglass windows of my cubicle. 

I've put this off as me mistaking kindness for attraction, but today she came by to ask what time I usually go to lunch, and seeing as we go at different times she mentioned that ""we definitely need to go to lunch together sometime"" and asking what kind of food places I usually go to.

"I'm great at making friends in my new city, but suck at dating. How do I get over this? Hi! So I (28M) have been single for several years now and am in a place where I'm ready to look for a long-term partner to Do Life with. I'd say my life is pretty solid - I have a steady job/career, great friends that I love, pretty active social/recreational life. But all in all just ready to take that next step. Only problem is that a couple years ago I moved to Los Angeles from the Southeast, and it feels like I've totally hit a wall. Is this normal, or am I just bad at this now?

I'm very comfortable around women &amp; always have been (both platonically and romantically), and despite some odds being stacked against me (I'm 5'6"" and a little overweight, but working on it for sure) I was doing pretty alright in terms of dating back home. I know dating in any big city is hard, but ever since I moved here it feels like I always get stuck. Like I mentioned in the title I'm great at making new friends - I'm told I'm really easy to talk to, I always ask questions and I'm a genuinely caring, thoughtful guy. This used to translate into my dating life pretty easily. But it's felt impossible to get a second date out here, even when the first date goes super well (and she says so!). Lots of delays in communication and scheduling issues (which I'm usually ok with in the early stages) in trying to make something happen tend to result in me getting a ""let's just stay friends"" and then never hearing from them again (except for on IG or something), or ""I'll let you know!"" and then they never let me know. Even if the person is someone I know/was friends with already! It feels super disheartening. I'm not gonna chalk it up to getting ""friendzoned"" but it definitely feels like that sometimes. 

So yeah. Just a lot of strikeouts that make me wonder if *I'm* the problem, or if this is just dating in your late 20s in a big city. I used to be good at this! What am I doing wrong?

Also to clarify: I steer clear of dating apps, so most of the women I've dated were already a friend/acquaintance. Not sure if this is part of the problem. But the apps are a whole other world of anxiety and self-doubt that I am ***not*** equipped to handle lmao",vellikor,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fs1h9/im_great_at_making_friends_in_my_new_city_but/,1690931703.0,1.0
"Dating for anxious artists 2023 I (25 m) like many people have always been into art, as a hobby and a job. For a long time I've been quite insular mainly due to pretty heavy self confidence issues and social anxiety (It took me a month from drafting this post to actually posting it), lately however I've been trying to get out of my little box. I've been looking for a place to meet women who are into digital art, anime/gaming that kind of stuff but to be honest its not going amazingly.

I've tried joining discords and online spaces but they almost all have a culture and energy that I really don't vibe with (not that it's good or bad, just not my scene) and I'm struggling with it. I understand that you shouldn't enter these spaces for the sole purpose of looking for a partner but when I don't enjoy being there to begin with it makes it hard to find anybody to even just become friends with.

I also used to go to a weekly in person drawing meetup in my city, however all of the women there were in long term relationships and that group ended up kind of falling apart after COVID.

"How do you actually meet people these days? I have no clue how to meet new women or at the very least I have no idea how to approach them. I live in a small town and people and almost all people here have developed some kind of trust issues. You litteraly can‚Äôt approach somebody without being percieved as a creep. I have tried messaging girls but either I don‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúseen‚Äù, get very short and boring replies that I have no idea how to follow up on, get replies but I can smell that they are either shy or mistrusting from the get go so the conversation is going nowhere, or once in a blue moon get a good conversation going but still get rejected for whatever reason.

For example, I messages a girl, we hit it off great, we went on two dates, albeit 2 days apart from each other, we had a blast both times, but the next day according to her words, she thought that we should stop communicating because past unresolved problems from her last relationship that lasted 7 years according to her words and she hasn‚Äôt quite healed from them, that I was ‚Äútoo mature‚Äù for her(again her words), that things were proceeding too fast. Mind you, I live in a very conservative city, so hookup culture isn‚Äôt as prevalent so we never had sex or anything of that sort, we didn‚Äôt even kiss, but her choice and I didn‚Äôt wanna push needlessly. Anyway, I was still baffled by her decision. I decided not to push because I think it would make me look pathetic if I tried to convince her to give us a try so I just accepted it and moved on.

So, what do I do? Should I just give up and just accept that I can‚Äôt do anything about it and wait for a miracle to happen and just maybe the woman that is for me will appear out od nowhere or does anyone have advice, because I am at a loss here.",AdamDrake21,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15frmch/how_do_you_actually_meet_people_these_days/,1690930650.0,1.0
"He canceled third date last minute. 22 f 24 m So little bit of backstory we met if Facebook originally and talked for two months everyday without any plan of meeting up. Once we made plans for Saturday. When Saturday rolled around, he said he completely forgot which I understand because we made plans a week in advance and maybe he forgot but that whole week I was looking forward to it. We made plans for two weeks later went to get a coffee, to walk around target to look at hot wheels and books and than a drive. Total time if first date was almost 7 hours. 
 
Second date was 2 weeks later. We got dinner and went to a walk at sunset. Both dates were good although the second one had some silence but it never seemed awkward as we were both walking and at times up hill or observing scenery. He never tried to touch me. No hug, hand touch or kiss. I tried to playfully touch his arms both dates and nothing in return. 

We made plans for a third date he canceled last minute because he had to watch his nephew which in no way was I upset over. What upset me was him not making further plans. I don‚Äôt like to date like this. I want to communicate that but is it to early in to communicate this? 

Just a simple message like ‚Äò hey, I have really enjoyed the time we‚Äôve spent together and talking!

"I (19M) have a crush (19F) Last year, I met a girl in ecology lab. I found her attractive, but I wasn't really interested in her because I didn't know her. We had one class together, but it swapped seating every week and we never sat next to each other or really talked on-one-on to each other much, but we had mutual friends and we chatted a little bit. The next semester (this spring) we took a chemistry class together and we got a little closer, but we still weren't talking to each other on a daily basis or anything, just small talk while in class or in passing. The semester ended and I ended up taking a summer course on one of our university's other campuses. She was doing an internship I recommended to her.  
  
One day, she and her cohort randomly come to the summer class campus and we hung out all day. There's a really big lake behind the main building that we went to and there was a log we sat on and just talked for a while and I felt like we were really vibing with each other in a way that wasn't solely platonic. We met back up with the group and did a mini photoshoot. She wanted to take a ton of pictures with me while we were wading in the lake and was getting really close and touchy when we were posing. She gave me her number to send her some pictures that I took, but we didn't text after that until she invited me to a party a couple of days later. I couldn't attend but thanked her nonetheless. We began talking more and getting a little closer. On Instagram, she posted pictures of our day on the lake and put a picture of just us first. Maybe I'm overthinking that, but I took pictures of just her and her with a friend she considers herself really close with, and those came later in the post order.  
  
We kept talking, but she left me on read and ghosted me randomly around early July, but I didn't want to push the envelope too heavily and seem desperate, so I just let it be. She finished the internship and was hiking in different state parks, so I didn't really mind it. She started posting on Instagram often, which confused me, but again, I really didn't mind. She texted me again a few days ago apologising for being MIA and telling me everything that's happened since we last spoke. I really don't know how to feel though. I feel as if I get crushes too fast and easily (we spent literally one day together and I began to like her) but something feels different this time. I hadn't given it much thought, but now I feel really conflicted. Mainly I'm conflicted because I've had bad experiences in the past with people ghosting me out of nowhere and such; I understand she didn't have service a lot/probably forgot to respond, but something just rubs me the wrong way. We're going back to school in a month or so, so I'll probably see her again. I want things to work out, and I'm not scared to ask her out if things seem like they can plausibly work out. I just want an objective set of eyes on the situation. Should I respond to her now, or wait a little bit? Even then, with another semester just around the corner, how should I even proceed if things look good?

I (29m) need advice, I have been talking with some (30f) for since Nov. we had met a social gathering back in nov. Started talking as friends. I live in cali and she lives in GA. We only see each other for a weekend out of the month . As I go every month for business trip. She has pretty much became my only friend there. So we spend majority if not all of the weekend together . We get along extremely well and seem to have so much in common . Literally seems to be the female version of me. Even our past have seem to be some what parallel that it is crazy.  has the months gone by we have some what became more then just friends and she has been labeling me as ‚ÄúBF‚Äù . Even tho it was never really discuss.  Lately I have been going through some stuff mentally. Not depression but just stress and being a better father to my son that‚Äôs a Yr and half. Tho I‚Äôm not a bad father at all .  I do tend to work a lot and when I‚Äôm not working have a lot on my mind from work or other responsibilities. So I‚Äôm trying to fix those areas in my life. Even tho this women is amazing and would love to continue this. I feel like this time in my life would not be the best. Because I would not be able to give her everything she wants in a relationship . (She‚Äôs looking for a husband , has two kids)  she doesn‚Äôt pressure me on this but I know this is what she looking for. As has to stay in GA for kids agreement with ex .

1. Focusing on being a better father to my son 
2. Living across the country

"(29m)My ex-girlfriend(27f) wants to have sex with me ‚Äî Our story before breaking up Our romance backstory is a bit unique: we both are HSV1 positive and we met on a herpes dating site. This platform provided an opportunity for individuals like us, who wanted connections from people who genuinely understood our shared reality.  
  
At the beginning of our relationship, we indulged in the high intensity of our connection, the passion that was unfiltered. The HSV1 condition was a bridge rather than a barrier, a springboard for an intense emotional relationship which blended into romance. We were companions in every sense, dealing with similar fears, health issues, leaning on each other for support and solace.  
  
However, relationship dynamics altered when I discovered that she had several male friends who were uncomfortably close to her. Although she claimed they were just friends, the perceived intimacy was enough to cast a shadow of doubt over our relationship. Conflicts ensued, trust issues magnified, and the misunderstandings spiraled, beyond any hope of resolution. It was then that our relationship met its untimely demise ‚Äî the end of an emotional journey.  
  
Our romantic relationship might have ended, but we did not completely lose touch. Bound by our shared medical condition and a past full of memories, we kept lingering in each other‚Äôs lives.  
  
Recently, though, she proposed us to engage in sexual relations again. A proposition not just loaded with concerns for our emotional health, but complicated by our existing friendship and the implications it could have on our HSV1 condition.  
  
As I look back on our rollercoaster journey and considering the complicated proposal at hand, I‚Äôm at crossroads, unsure about the path forward. I thought sharing my story here might help.

"I was happier when I believed I would be alone forever Now that I have that little bit of hope, I‚Äôve opened myself up to constant rejection and pain. 

This process of having to relearn again that I not only am probably going to end up alone and sad, but that I in fact deserve it too, is excruciating. 

Why am I alone? I am decidedly an unviable sexual and romantic partner. First of all because when I was a teenager I had a problem with self harm. Cutting yourself is about the least masculine thing you can do. Even if I stopped 10 years ago, it doesn‚Äôt matter to the people looking at me. I‚Äôve recently tried to cover them with tattoos but they are still visible. Before that I just didn‚Äôt wear short sleeves or go swimming for an entire year. Maybe we go back to that to avoid the questions. 

Secondly, I lack typical masculine features. I don‚Äôt grow chest hair or really much hair on my legs at all. I can‚Äôt grow a beard. My voice is disgustingly high pitched. It‚Äôs like a squeaky toy going through a cheese grater. People often assume I am gay. None of this isn‚Äôt going to change either. I‚Äôm 25. 

I don‚Äôt have the genetics to get some insane physique either, so even though I destroy myself in the gym, I can‚Äôt seem to build any visible muscle and still look pretty underwhelming. 

I get that this is a confidence thing. You can make up for a lot by being confident. How the fuck can I be confident when I have zero good qualities? How can I believe that I deserve to be with someone when I know they can do infinitely better? I like them, clearly I want them to be happy. Why would I want them to be with me? Thats not their best life and sounds miserable.

"I tried to DTR via text and I've now been pushed away. Did I f**k up too much or could there still be a chance? (I tried to make it as short as possible, but its a long post) So I met a guy (we will call him JOHN) via a friend and for the last month or so, we have been in a situationship. He and I (F) share the same humor, a lot of the same hobbies, and as I have gotten to know him, my feelings went from ""Oh, this guy is alright"" to ""damn, I really really like this guy"".

I didn't say anything at first about liking him because he was a new addition to the friend group and I didn't want to mess with the chemistry there, but JOHN got my number and pursued me. We flirted A LOT via text, when we were at group hangs together, but he never asked me out on a date. I didn't put any pressure on our situation because I didn't want to rush anything, but then we hooked up a couple times, and classically, I developed feelings. Post hookups, he was still totally interested in me and seemed to really care about me, but I got nervous that I wasn't being taken seriously as a potential partner. I have easily triggered anxiety when it comes to dating, which I told him, so I was really trying to just live in the moment and not freak out that we hadn't DTR or anything. He seemed to understand and still care.

However, 3 major events have happened post hookups:

1. JOHN got jealous at a club that I have platonic guy friends that I drink / dance with, and even though I explained these guys are just friends of mine, JOHN was like ""we are done"". It wasn't soon after that I heard from JOHN asking if I wanted to be FWB - I said no because I had developed feelings for him and if he wasn't interested in a relationship, it would be better to be friends.
2. We didn't stop flirting (always initiated first on his side) to the point where I assumed he wasn't mad anymore and we fell back to our old routine. I asked him to get dinner and he shot me down with the classic ""we are just friends"". I was obviously very confused, hurt, and I told him it wasn't ok to be leading me on, which he acknowledged he was doing.
3. After a week, our flirting resumed AGAIN (initiated by him... again). But I clarified what I was looking for / expecting (he wanted FWB still, I wanted something more - maybe not a relationship right away, but something that would grow into one for sure and again - I always explained that). After a few days of back and forth, I texted him and he was giving cold shoulder. My anxiety got the better of me and I sent a long text (which I now regret) asking what we were doing. I was losing patience with the situation, so I asked him if he liked me enough to figure it out or just wanted to be friends. This annoyed / upset him and he said I was texting to much / being clingy. I apologized for it and now he still texts me, but platonically. 

All of this has happened within a month and a half. I know I should be more mature and having these conversations with him via phone call or in person (cause most of these happened via text), but since our last exchange regarding ""us"", I feel like I have to play the ""I don't care, I am moving on"" card because I know that if I reached out, he wouldn't be open to talking. I also want a relationship and he wants FWB, so reaching out isn't worth it cause we don't even want the same thing.

I am annoyed because there is clear tension between us when we are together, we obviously have feelings for each other, and though there is this hot and cold energy, it's just... very clear we would be a power couple and the physical aspect would be 1000%. That is all I can say - we would crush it if we dated, but I don't want to hold out hope that he will come back because I am better then that. I am not perfect, but I know I deserve better than this.  

The rational side of me says I should move on because even if he does reach out to me again, I need to be clear about what I want, but I have feelings that won't go away now, even though I am trying to set up dates with other guys / focus on myself. I'm also a hopeful romantic, so I am constantly thinking ""this is the one"" when it comes to my relationships - it's an issue I need to work on, but what can I say? I love Love and want to find my person.

So, what do I do? How should I read this (from a guy's perspective)? I am genuinely so confused by his behavior and I don't think he will come back, but I want him to. I want him to take me seriously as more then a FWB, more then a friend, but now I feel like I totally blew my chance. If he does come back, how should I approach it?

And no, the friends we mutually share do not know about the situation (or I haven't said anything to them. I don't know if he has said something, but ya, that isn't a concern for me because the friend group dynamic is still totally fine).",MountainPizza7313,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fv821/i_tried_to_dtr_via_text_and_ive_now_been_pushed/,1690940237.0,0.5

"At what point do you know you like someone? Admittedly, I don‚Äôt really have strong feelings or attachment towards other people. I date frequently and have never had issues with gaining friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc. 

A lot of media and whatnot will talk about sparks flying or something like that. General joy when you are with this person who you love. I don‚Äôt necessarily have high standards with the people I date, it‚Äôs mostly just to weed out the people I can‚Äôt stand. 

I‚Äôve apparently made a lot of my exes sad by breaking up with them. I break up with them when I get bored or decide to stop tolerating them, basically. I won‚Äôt sugar coat things. However, I never really feel any regret or pain over it. It all feels like just another part of the cycle. This leads me to believe that I never actually liked them and just dated them because I figured it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be bad for me to try something ‚Äòdifferent.‚Äô

So this leads me to a few questions:

"I (M32) feel uneasy about getting back into OLD as I‚Äôm feeling more insecure/unattracrive I started using tinder in in 2020, and for a year + or so I went on a lot of dates, like a lot. No struggles getting dates but it went just ok, a lot of 1st dates and some second dates, and the occasional 3rd date. 
 I felt more or less confident and I had no issues getting matches at all. I had pretty good photos, probably too good as I picked the best ones of me, which were a little too good compared to irl. Some were 2-3 years old. 

Fast forward to today, I have removed or replaced most of the photos to more recent ones. Photos that are ok but probably not as attractive as the previous ones, and I can tell it‚Äôs a lot harder to get matches for the past few months. Dating on the apps is really superficial, I‚Äôm aware of it and it sucks. Doubly so as I also want to date someone I find attractive.

The reality now is that I‚Äôm balding and it obviously changes a lot in term of looks. I‚Äôm not feeling very confident about my looks anymore and I don‚Äôt know how to tackle it. I‚Äôm not really living up to how I used to look anymore. Definitely feel like my looks faded.
Other than that, my dating wasn‚Äôt that succesful to begin with as I found it difficult to get past a second date-ish. How am I supposed to face this and carry on?

"Hookup advice Talking to a guy on tinder (legit account dw). 
I havent hooked up with someone before. I've had sex with one other person who I was really comfortable with since I DATED them for over a year, but for a hookup idk how ill be. my personality is awkward and I don't see myself as relly hot or anything so I cant really act that way, like enticing or anything. 
idk how I'm gonna be- like I'm great with boundaries etc so saying no if i feel weird won't phase me, but inevitably things will be a bit uncomfortable at times bc jts my first time hooking up.

so the question is, do I meet him first on a really casual ""date"" thing?? meetup whatever u wanna call it. Or should I just go straight in and go to his place?? (I have safety stuff like a friend to call etc so dw about that). he seems very nice and down to earth so ik we can get on.

a positive of meeting first is potentially being more comfortable with him to have sex later on since I know him more, grasp him a bit better. But the downside would be i have to go through a whole slightly awkward social thing, as well as a maybe awkward sex thing later on anyway. 
Also, it could turn either of us off a little bit since idrrrrrc care ab his personality too much since it's a hookup and if we're not socially that compatible it could ruin the hookup?? 

meeting at his house tho straight away, I won't really know what to do bc I've never hooked up and also I can't act sexy or initiate loads. I'm a verrrrry awkward person.
But it could be easier for above reasons???

"When and how it is acceptable to ask about your partner's previous relationships and sexual history? Probably a controversial topic, let me explain.  
  
I \[27M\] have a religius background, but I have not been religious at all since I was about 16, I would define myself as an atheist at the moment. Although I am no longer religious, my upbringing had a strong influence on my values. I have been only in 3 long time relationships and only had sex with these three girl. I did not participate in hookup culture at all, 0 one night stand, 0 fwb. Sex is something that for me involves a lot of emotions and I need to feel connecion and trust.  
  
As I hold and have lived by these views, I would look for the same in my future partner, but I don't know how and when to ask. Many people get offended if I ask anything about their past at the beginning, but I think it's something that should be discussed early enough so we don't waste each other time and don't hurt eachother.  
  
This is not about numbers. If she had 10 1 year long realationship and had sex with all 10 is perfectly fine for me, but if she had 2 one night stands or fwb it's a turn off for me.  
  
I honestly don't want to judge anyone. It's perfectly fine if someone has different views on this. I know many people will probably disagree with me, but these are my preferences, and I need advice on when and how to bring this up without offending others and to find out if we share the same views.

"Is she playing me.. again? 
[M21] [F20]

Beginning of this year we met and got close quick. Within 2 months we were doing all the BF &amp; GF stuff. But she would never commit because she was ‚Äúscared‚Äù from previous relationships. Overtime she‚Äôd dodge my texts, flake on plans and told me she needed to ‚Äúwork on herself‚Äù after leading me on for weeks. typical excuse.

I immediately went no contact &amp; we didn‚Äôt talk for 7 months. In this time i‚Äôve grown my own business, worked out and overall bettered myself dramatically. 

A few weeks ago she reached out apologizing for how she was before and that she should‚Äôve loved me and wants to hangout again. I gave in

We hung out and it went well. We caught up and in that time she mentioned how she tried dating other guys but got cheated on. Using context clues it turns out she left me to date another guy. 

She hypes me up, makes hints towards wanting something serious with me, how she loves my mindset when it comes to work and as a person. How i‚Äôm so much more mature and have my stuff together. Making future plans regarding events to go together etc. 

Me being stupid, I ignore the red flag of the past and we start hanging out again over the last 2 weeks. We‚Äôre now actively hooking up and seeing each other, she even mentions how great the sx is the day after each time.. so that‚Äôs good right? but randomly she goes cold on me and lags on texts, flakes on plans. Then will randomly will give that energy back as if she didn‚Äôt just ghost me. She is breadcrumbing me and it sucks.

Yesterday she posted on her story her in another guys car going to a car meet. I do a bit of digging and she‚Äôs commented heart eye emojis on this dudes tiktok‚Äôs as well as another guy from before all while we‚Äôve been seeing each other.

I understand that we‚Äôre not exclusive but I feel a bit played again. I feel like i‚Äôm just used for attention. How do I make it clear to her that i‚Äôm not going to sit and be an option to choose from. it‚Äôs either me and only me, or i‚Äôm gone? Make it known that if she doesn‚Äôt respect my time and effort then she gets none? 

I‚Äôve left her on read for over 24hrs now- i‚Äôve muted all social medias as if i went ghost.
No viewing stories or anything. 

Do I call her out on how she‚Äôs behaving? How do I make it clear that i‚Äôm not one to sit around and play games?

I‚Äôm not texting her unless she reaches out first, if that doesn‚Äôt happen then i‚Äôm already moved on but when she does reach out, I want a game plan moving forward.",Own_Inevitable4939,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fu58o/is_she_playing_me_again/,1690937261.0,1.0
"Why would a guy say they want to marry you without actually being exclusive with you? Disclaimer: I have ADHD so I apologize in advance if this story is all over the place but please read and let me know if you have any insight! 

This has happened to me twice, at 2 different moments in my life‚Ä¶

The quick little backstory, I messed around with both guys (not at the same time) and we werent exclusive because it‚Äôs just not what I was looking for at the time. They didn‚Äôt say it to get in my pants because we were already messing around. Months after messing around they‚Äôve brought marriage up. I make pretty good money and they both know it. One of them makes more than me but started talking about getting married once I actually got the money making job, haha. So it felt like convenience in a way, but at the same time it didn‚Äôt since he already made a lot of money. The other one makes decent money and I‚Äôve been knowing/messing around with for a while on and off. And he said that since we‚Äôve been messing with each other for so long it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre already in a relationship. LIKE WHAT!? What am I missing here? why would someone bring up marriage without being exclusive intentionally ? Maybe they don‚Äôt want to consider dating unless we both go into it with marriage in mind? 

I didn‚Äôt think about the whole marriage proposals back then because I didn‚Äôt want something serious but now that I actually want a serious relationship, not exactly looking for marriage, but I do want to settle down with someone, this comes to mind a lot. And I‚Äôm trying to make sense of it. I‚Äôve dated men I like after them and didn‚Äôt sleep with them cause I wanted to take things slow and not give it up unless we‚Äôre exclusive. And it feels like it backfired because it hasn‚Äôt worked out. Do I have to sleep with men for them to want to be exclusive!? I thought exclusivity first then sex, maybe there isn‚Äôt a right order, every situation is different. Like now that I‚Äôm trying to do things in the right order, things aren‚Äôt working out for me?

I was talking to this guy, for around a month. We started talking in mid June. We went on two dates and had a third date planned.

He was still starting conversations though. Then, he started leaving me on read and I asked him if everything was okay. He told me something had happened and that he needed to focus on himself and his family for a bit. I asked if he wanted to text me when things got better and he said that‚Äôd be great.

"conflict arising when an introvert dates and extrovert...off my chest, and advice? I was gonna post this in AITA but I felt like I am the AH..so now I am mainly venting and looking for insights and advice

  
I've been dating this guy (P) for 4 months and it was his birthday this past Sunday. We went to a nearby town with his friends who I had not met before. There were 12 of us. Now I am an introvert and social interactions really drain me, especially with people that I don't know. I kinda despise small talks as well. It's not that I am antisocial; I can be quite social, needing to see people almost everyday and love talking to people, but in small dosage like 3-4 hours, and with close friends. Therefore, after a few hours on this trip I was just absolutely drained. P on the other hand loves socialising and gets on with everyone (which is one of the things I appreciate about him).

  
On this occasion, because there were so many of us. Everywhere we went we had to split into different tables. Throughout larger part of the day, I felt like he was not paying attention to me at all, he always ended up on a different table, or a different group, wherever we went, so I was feeling quite anxious, because I felt like I had to make conversations with his friends for hours on end and he was off catching up with his friends, bouncing from group to group. I tried hard to rationalise it as I understood it was his birthday and he had to catch up with his friends, some of whom he might not have seen in ages. But as the day went on, I couldn't help but felt more and more, for a lack of better word, ""neglected"". My rational mind tells me I shouldn't feel this way as I know he was there for me and he was just there with his friend, but the emotional part of my brain was just screaming, ""why can't he even pay some attention to me, or sit with me for a while"". I felt like I was just thrown into the deep end (socialising with strangers) without an anchor (him). There was a point where the group went to laser tag, and we had to split into different teams, his friends teamed up by themselves and said this way me and him could be on the same team. I was standing next to him, when he went straight to team up with other people leaving me behind without even talking to me or looking at me. I was really fighting an internal battle because on one hand, I felt like a massive selfish, needy AH who needed so much attention and wouldn't socialise with his friends, on his birthday no less, and also kinda a failure for not being able to socialise with his friends and be a good partner in front of his friends that he can be proud of; I know rationally he didn't mean to make me feel any of this, he was just too excited to see his friends. On the other hand, I felt like I couldn't help how I felt, and it was an overwhelming situation for an introvert like me, like sensory overload, and I felt I wasn't getting any support / acknowledgement from him.

  
After about 6 hours into the trip, at 3pm, I was already drained and kinda didn't want to talk to anyone. On top of that, I received an email saying I had been rejected by a job I really wanted. This was when he noticed me having a bad mood and asked me what was wrong, and whether I was enjoying. I replied that I was struggling to have fun, and I was tired and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I really regretted my tone right when I said it. Also I didn't tell him about the job thing because maybe I felt it was irrelevant, or I was embarrassed, but it definitely contributed to my low mood. He went suddenly quiet and I knew he was upset. But I asked him to tell me what he was thinking, he just told me he wanted me to have a good time.

  
We went on to do the activities planned for the rest of the day. It was good time tbh. I think he consciously tried to pay more attention to me, so when the 12 of us split into two tables for dinner, we ended up sitting next to each other, and then also on the train back to the town where we live.  
Once his friends left and we were alone though, it was obvious that there was something in the air, because neither of us talked about the trip at all, nor did we debrief on meeting his friends for the first time. Well, we went straight to bed. The next day I picked a time and asked him whether he had been upset with me. He said he wasn't so much upset with me as he wanted me to have a good time and felt responsible for it if I didn't. I told him social interactions just overwhelmed me after a while and it was a lot for me. And most importantly, I felt like for the first 6 hours of the trip we hardly spoke. I hardly saw him / interacted with him. He said it wasn't true (I concede he might have had a different perspective? but I really thought what I thought). I explained that even when I was at a festival the day before the trip with my friends, I still had to go off and be alone for a while because it was getting too much, and that was with MY friends, this time I had to make a lot of esoteric conversations with 10 people I just met, it was just too much. He went sometimes it just had to be that way, that we had to make conversations, and we couldn't just not hang out with others ever, which I actually agreed. I did end up telling him about the job, which he understood.

  
That was two days ago, we moved on, but for the past two days I felt like shit, because I felt like I ruined his birthday, we were so looking forward to it, but now he will remember not feeling good after I said I wasn't having a good time. I hate that I contributed to that. I also feel conflicted because I don't know what I could have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same thing happening again, because I know what I know logically, I tried on the trip to rationalise and lay out the facts in front of my eyes (that he was just too excited to see his friends, that he wasn't ignoring me, that it's normal to have to socialise in that way), but I still felt the negative emotions at that moment. Honestly, I feel like I failed. I knew the facts, I knew I should have been better, but I couldn't. And knowing that his friends are so important to him, I just hope it hasn't put a damper on what we have going forward. The only solace is that I don't think his friends would have been aware of my internal struggle; I did talk to them normally and they probably just thought I was someone that are quieter than the average person. Honestly they are all super nice people and I would love to hang out with them again.

  
I always believe it's good to compromise / communicate / find a solution. But when we tried to find a solution to this, we were both stumped. As I said, not sure what I should have done differently, not sure what we could do going forward to prevent the same happening again.

"55 and still going strong. But......... So today (8/1/2023), I celebrated my 55th birthday. As much as I thank God for this opportunity to still be on his green earth üåé, I feel like my life is at a standstill especially in the relationship dept. Long story short, I was dating the same woman since 2000, got married in 2012, became a father in between (those years), officially divorced in 2019. It's been 4 yrs since the divorce, with most of that time focusing on work, and trying hard to be a good and exceptional father. So much so, that my friends feel that at some point, I need to find some time for myself to hang out maybe even date again. I do go out once in a while (movies, restaurants, etc) but with friends (no issue there). But dating, especially today's MF app filled world we live in, presents a real challenge to those like myself.  After reading some of the dating threads on reddit (particularly those geared toward the older adults), I don't know if I really have the patience to deal with alot of the BS that comes with most of these dating apps people use. On the other hand, THIS IS the type of world we live in today. The majority of our lives, to a certain degree, revolves around apps and social media.

"Should I work on social skills before dating skills? (25M) With the help of my therapist, I recently discovered that I‚Äôve had issues with intimacy/connecting with other people for practically my entire life. I operate well in group settings and have a circle of friends, but I have never been comfortable with taking social risks or initiating conversations. As a result of this, I‚Äôve spent the vast majority of my spare time alone. There are several social experiences that I feel pretty insecure about not having done, like ordering from a bar or going to a real party, but anything relating to dating and romance is by far my biggest insecurity. I‚Äôve never even held someone‚Äôs hand, let alone gone on a date or kissed, and I feel that my understanding of how relationships actually work is very na√Øve and influenced by movies and TV. 

I know that I will need to put myself out there and get into uncomfortable situations to improve my social skills. I‚Äôm wondering, though, if I should work myself up to dating by doing other things with friends, or if I should try finding dates right away to gain some experience. I think it would be helpful to get a better sense of myself and understand how to navigate more social situations first, but I also suspect that my lack of romantic experience is only going to become a bigger red flag as time goes on. 

Any thoughts, advice or perspective on this would be most appreciated!",blacklabradoodle,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15flyn7/should_i_work_on_social_skills_before_dating/,1690917551.0,1.0

"Confused Hello all! I just started seeing this guy. My stomach fills with excitement thinking of him. Can‚Äôt wait to see him again. It feels crazy, it‚Äôs so easy to make plans that are literally months out. I feel confident/secure with him. I am always so hung up on if he likes me, does he want to be with me.

My hang up- I think he‚Äôs cute. I think I‚Äôm sexually attracted to him. I say think because I haven‚Äôt had sex in 5 years. He is awakening those feelings. I definitely didn‚Äôt have these sexual feelings before on one night stands or even past relationships. What I‚Äôm feeling right now. But I am overthinking this part: is it because I haven‚Äôt had sex in so long- that I am just excited or is it him? I can picture sex with him and all the things I want to do and want him to do. 

I am scared of what if this works out? I‚Äôm scared of being hurt. But I want to be with him. Picturing future things with him and it scares but excites me. I want to know more about him. 

I worry I‚Äôm not attracted to him enough, I think he‚Äôs cute. But I think he deserves more from me. I think as time goes on I become more attracted to him. But is that fair to him?

We met up and he said that he has been feeling scared and insecure about our relationship but he feels the idea of losing me has made him want to be better for me.

He has called a therapist to discuss his insecurities.

"Guy didn't look like his pictures. Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great.

I've begun to really wrestle with the philosophy of bad luck vs my own inadequacies the last couple years because of my story; Basically I had a first relationship that lasted 5 and a half years starting at the end of my teens and I believe a lot of its longevity was down to my work ethic and ability to know what a girl requires and treat her right (until I decided that I wanted to try something different, maybe a huge mistake on my part) so I have a self assurance/confidence about my ability to maintain a relationship.

I went to university and devoted most of my efforts into being as social as possible - especially for the first year I became known as the social, charismatic guy in my circles and knew a pretty insane amount of people tbh, like on friendly terms with a lot. Important to mention due to my university about 80 percent of these people were girls so you probably wouldn't imagine that I've barely had 2 non substantial shows of interest (that never went anywhere) from girls romantically in those 4 years. It's led me to question where I'm going wrong, like 'is it my looks' (even though before I always considered myself to be average to kinda decent with good style etc) or is it actually luck that has been the major factor I've been missing.

"Am I (17F) wrong for ending the relationship(16M) because of my preference? TL;DR: Guy I used to date would lust over other women and tried to hit up my friend. I blocked him without an explanation. am i wrong?


A while ago, this guy from my school texted me on Instagram complimenting me and basically hinting that I was attractive. He told me he noticed me in the cafeteria everyday, and that from day one he was too afraid to approach me. Well that‚Äôs when I made my move and the conversation started to spark from there. Every time someone shows interest in me, I tend to check their following just to see who they‚Äôre mutuals with or out of curiosity. 


I noticed that this guy followed a lot of insta models and very pretty local girls that went to my school. I tend to find this common within guys so I basically let it slide since we weren‚Äôt really in a relationship. Well, like a week later he asked me out and i accepted, still aware of his following but not really taking it to heart. It was nice, we did things together and hung out after school. However, after a month it kinda started to bother me, especially considering the fact that he liked photos from several models that recently posted within a day. I tried not to take it personal, but it was after he kept telling me I was the only girl he had his eyes set for, that really triggered me in a sense. Like I really don‚Äôt care about men masturbating to porn, but lusting over women that didn‚Äôt look anything like me is depressing. And yet when I would talk to him about certain guys I found attractive just to be even, he got highly upset with me. He was even in my friend‚Äôs messages, calling her attractive and never let her know he was in a relationship.

After that, I basically blocked him without having him explain himself because we have had conversations about this in the past, and he told me ‚Äújust because i follow girls doesn‚Äôt mean you have to break up with me‚Äù; I gave him several chances after that but it just kept getting worse. He would try and hide his phone from me even though he literally asked for my account, he moved every girl he talked to into General on insta, and he would even like local girls bikini pics.

From that point I deleted social media to try and heal. Im just wondering if I‚Äôm crazy for feeling the way I do.

2 hours later I‚Äôm leaving and told him I had fun and to text me if he wanted to have sex again.

I‚Äôm not looking for anything past sex, not sure if he knows that.

"Advice on getting in touch with someone i ghosted? I was talking to this girl for awhile and I decided that I really really liked her. We talked, I got to know her and we have a lot in common. She seemed to have everything I‚Äôd want in a person emotionally and I found her really attractive

She said something small to upset me and I got scared and cut all contact. It was this as well as the fact that she has ADHD. I know this is a really dumb reason; I‚Äôm autistic and I attract people who are like me

The thing is, I was abused by someone with adhd. They who used their issues with object permanence (or emotional permanence I‚Äôm not really sure of the right term) to harm me. Basically, since they knew I have abandonment trauma from a parent and developed issues around that, repeatedly told me that I am disposable to them. That they don‚Äôt think about me at all when I‚Äôm not around. So out of fear of this, I avoid people who have adhd

Does anyone have advice on getting back into contact and working through this with the girl I stopped talking to? I sent her a discord message a couple months ago and she didn‚Äôt respond

"What on earth is casual dating and how does it work? So, I‚Äôve only ever understood dating where you see each other more and more with rising levels of intimacy, frequency of communication and commitment. It all goes well you end up in a committed, exclusive LTR. If things don‚Äôt go well, you break up.

I have a somewhat anxious attachment style and I tend to match and escalate levels of affection. It tends to get me into trouble when I find myself overcommitting. I can‚Äôt fathom being interested in someone but only a little bit, where you only talk or see each other from time to time, but maybe I should explore it.

"My heart is hurting 
So, met this girl at a party. We hit it off, she asked for my phone number and she wanted something serious.
 
Every one of our dates went great! She would want to extend our date and everything.

We went to Hollywood Studios. She got us to take ‚Äúcouple photos‚Äù and hinted that I asked her to be bf/gf. But I was stupid and didn‚Äôt ask.

She went on family vacation. Got drunk and said
‚ÄúHey I think you‚Äôre great, but honestly don‚Äôt see it going anywhere‚Äù
 She then started reaching out to me like nothing happened.

We eventually went out again. Once again everything went great! But she kinda distanced herself from me a bit.

It got really bad when she had a breakdown in my room. Like a mini one. Then got embarrassed and left. Didn‚Äôt talk to me for a few days.

Our mutual friend asked how she was and she said ‚Äúgreat!‚Äù
Mentioned how things between her and I are ‚Äúgoing good!‚Äù

Him: safe to say you guys are bf and gf now?
Her: no
Him: How come?
Her: why would we be?
Him: idk. Figured you‚Äôd be happy in a relationship
Her: lmao maybe


When I opened up and said how I felt. She rejected me by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pursue that‚Äù

So, I cancelled our next date. I needed time out and went out with friends. (a lot of my friends are women). I guess one of the posted a picture of us all hanging out. And now she is being a bit more respectful.

We spoke on the phone and she still wants to see me and hangout. Maybe she isn‚Äôt ready for something serious. She is a VERY career focused individual. I did set some boundaries. Telling her she can‚Äôt just go through stuff and essentially ghost me. And she can‚Äôt play games of not feeling okay and me asking and her not telling.

She also apologized for her behavior. Said she NEEDED to focus on her Mental Health that week. She was going through it and shit the world out. She has anxiety and dreams but I think it‚Äôs more than that.

I really like her a lot. I do wish I was more successful and I‚Äôm currently working in that. I‚Äôve been treating her like a gf when I probably shouldn‚Äôt have. She used to treat me like a bf when we were first dating. But stopped suddenly. 

We don‚Äôt talk to each other as much. Which is what I‚Äôm sad about. But she is like afraid of letting me go.

We are hanging out Friday. Imma see what happens.
But I‚Äôm not going in with high expectations. I should‚Äôve asked back then, feel like I fucked that part up. We‚Äôve been dating 2 months, into our 3rd. We hookup usually when she comes over. She wanted to meet my brother and play board games with me and my siblings.

But idk if we‚Äôre still dating or she wants us to go as friends. I guess I‚Äôll see. But yeah, I‚Äôm focusing more on my career than women now.

"Dog fear problem I recently met a very charming girl. She is an animal lover and has around five different animals at her small apartment, including two dogs. However, I have a significant issue with dogs. Ever since I was bitten by a dog in my childhood, I have developed a phobia of dogs, if such a thing exists.

She didn't seem offended when I showed fear towards her dogs, and she said her dogs liked me and they don't get excited unless they like someone. I don't know what to do; should I try to overcome my fear, or should I stop before any of us get hurt? Will this ever work out? I love dogs and dog videos, but I can't be near one physically.

"I tried to please my boyfriend and it backfired TL;DR - I tried to improve my long distance relationship and instead it turned into a breakup and I feel confused and heartbroken, how can I move past this?

Me (21f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been long distance (7 hours away) for a year, and with that can come arguments. However when we‚Äôre in person we‚Äôre completely fine. I talked to him about doing my year internship in his city so we can be together and he was overjoyed. We found a place and paid a big deposit and I was due to move down today and start my internship a week today.

Last week he turned around and said he doesn‚Äôt like the place anymore and he doesn‚Äôt want to live there, I was of course upset due to how late he had left it as I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find anywhere else now. He suggested living together at his parents until we‚Äôve saved enough money to get our own place, I was apprehensive as this wasn‚Äôt our plan and I like independence (no parents) and on top of that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to do whatever in his house so usually stay in his room, but I said I‚Äôd think about it but if I didn‚Äôt want to do that then we‚Äôre stuck and I can‚Äôt do my internship as it‚Äôs an expensive city and could not afford rent by myself. He then says the place is fine (which is a lie because he‚Äôs already said he doesn‚Äôt want to live there) but I said the place is off the table now as I don‚Äôt want him to live somewhere he isn‚Äôt comfortable with and for him to resent me for it.

8 hours later he rings me and breaks up with me saying he can‚Äôt do this anymore and he doesn‚Äôt deserve me etc. of course I was devastated and tried to fight for him to change his mind, he didn‚Äôt. Since then we‚Äôve had a couple arguments regarding my chances of doing my internship I worked really hard for are gone and how this came out of no where as the days before he was talking a lot about our future, and how I sacrificed so much for him by moving 7 hours across the country with no friends or family to be with him.

Yesterday I asked him for my deposit money back in which he said the landlord hasn‚Äôt gave him it, this then escalated to him saying he broke up with me because we argue too much, I‚Äôm draining and tiring and he wants to move on (he deleted any sign of me off his ig and followed girls back I was uncomfortable with a couple days after we broke up). He‚Äôs turned all of this on me and made it out to be all my fault and he doesn‚Äôt care in the slightest meanwhile I‚Äôm heartbroken and worried for my future. I won‚Äôt deny that we argue, mainly over silly petty things as we‚Äôre both stubborn and recently my mental health hasn‚Äôt been great which can contribute towards it but he‚Äôs said some nasty things to me too yet in person we‚Äôre great.

A couple weeks ago he argued we aren‚Äôt putting in effort anymore so I did all that I could to show him I was (I made him tiktoks, ig story posts, sent him big loving paragraphs etc yet he didn‚Äôt reciprocate) I still tried to be a good person and I sent him all his birthday presents down for him even after we broke up (I wrote him a love letter about our future, I made mini Lego figures of us, I made a picture book of our firsts, the many reasons I love him, a plan of 85 dates for us to do when we live together, and customised vinyl) I also spent a lot of money on a record player for him but couldn‚Äôt sent it down as it was too expensive for shipping, but I was trying to prove I was willing to make effort which he asked for.

A conversation I tried to have with him a couple weeks ago was that I‚Äôd appreciate if he could do my love language more for me (Words of affirmation) to tell me how much he loves appreciates and misses me etc yet that escalated into a big argument as he sends me flowers regularly but I‚Äôve told him as much as I love and appreciate them not to spend money on me as I just love the little things and a message costs nothing.

""You're a great guy, but my ex (insert something ex did here)""

""You're a great guy, but I don't want to commit"" (it's worth noting that this particular girl got into a committed relationship 2 weeks later)

""You're a great guy, but I actually don't want to date"" (whenever I hear this, I wonder why even be on a dating app in the first place?)

I always try my best to be my authentic self, I try to make people laugh, I like to talk about life and hobbies, I go into a date expecting nothing except a good conversation with someone I'd like to know better, and I respect boundaries. So what am I doing wrong here?

"Am I just a booty call? I (F21) have been seeing this guy (M21) for a month or two now. We talked and texted a ton before hanging out. We met through Hinge.

He definitely gets really nervous, awkward, and shy when we hang out and never really knows what to say. Since then, he‚Äôs stuck with inviting me over at night after he‚Äôs been drinking or after we‚Äôve both been drinking.

Here‚Äôs where it gets confusing: when we hang that late, I assumed he wants sex but we haven‚Äôt had sex because he gets whiskey dck and can barely hard enough. Yet he keeps inviting me over after he‚Äôs been drinking. He just wants to kiss, cuddle, sleep and spoon together, talk, show me stuff he‚Äôs been up to and talk about each other family, friends and life. He‚Äôs always saying that we don‚Äôt have to do stuff and he wants me to be comfortable with him. And whenever I can‚Äôt hang with him, he‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúI kinda wish you were with me‚Äù etc.

However, now I‚Äôm super confused because that‚Äôs usually a booty call if he‚Äôs calling and inviting me over during times from like 9pm-1am? 

The only thing I can think of is that it‚Äôs just an unhealthy coping mechanism to be more confident when we hang. When we‚Äôve been drinking, he‚Äôll call me pretty, be so chatty, want to kiss me and can‚Äôt stop smiling like he‚Äôs really happy I‚Äôm there. While his personality is the same, he‚Äôs just more honest and outwardly affectionate after drinking.

I just don‚Äôt want to be boiled down to a person that he only likes to be arounr when he‚Äôs drunk late at night. I do like him a ton and think he‚Äôs great.

"I (25F) don't know how to proceed with my partners (28F) behavior Ive gotten into a new relationship with a girl who has never experienced being in a homosexual relationship before while I myself have been in a couple. She's told me she was confused and was afraid of letting down her homophobic parents and I've always been understanding about that and said she could take her time figuring it out. That really isn't the problem here.

My problem is that she seems to be afraid of letting people down, seemingly becuase she's in a relationship with me. She goes out with her ex boyfriend who has repeatedly expressed that hes still interested with her. Even sometimes still sleeping over at their formerly shared place even if I've expressed discomfort about it before. She asks him for rides and entertains conversations and going out with him. She tells me its because she wants to keep him close so that she wouldnt have to explain to her parents that she might be with someone new (me), while at the same time she doesn't really wan't to hurt her ex.

I honestly don't mind that shes struggling with her identity, or that she doesn't seem to be fully comfortable with being in a queer relationship. But honestly, her actions hurt and I know she just want's to please everyone else but it almost feels like it's at my expense.

I don't know how to handle this. Should I cut my losses and just leave? Should I stay because she repeatedly assures me that I'm the one she want's to be with? It's all getting a little bit too much and I honestly don't know what to make of it anymore. Any advice?

So we had a couple of days that were amazing and both were initiated by me but he acted like a gentleman in both instances. I even said no to sex with him on the second date and after that he still wanted to see me and was nice about it. We don't live in the same state so I have to travel to the neighboring state to see him. He seemed so shy and almost in love that even my friends were surprised. And after I left, nothing. He leaves me on read, doesn't reply until 24h later and barely views my stories. I'm going back next week and he said he wanted to meet but I don't understand his behavior. Now, I'd think it's because he doesn't give a damn, but it apparently isn't?

I texted him about his ghosting and he replied 1sec later telling me that he's busy, not ghosting me, and apologized. He also waits until my stories almost expire to view them which gives me the suspicion he's playing hard to get and is into mind games. After I left I thought he'd block me or unmatch me or both, but he hasn't so far, which is weird for a duckboy, so I'm completely lost. 

A few things that might shed light on the issue, though, are:

He said he didn't want a ldr but kept talking about the possibility of dating and also brought up kids and marriage on the second date (I didn't, I kinda laughed awkwardly when he suggested dating).

We didn't really have dates dates, I brought him with my friends both times (althoufh the first one we ended up at his place) and he's a bit shy.

He gave off vibes of either a narcissist (kept talking about himself) or a shy person that's trying to look cool and impress the ""hot girl"", clearly doing it wrong.

He said he's very picky with women and was a fuckboy years ago after a breakup but didn't really like it because first time sex is awkward to him, so now is trying to find a wife (he's traditional) because he already has a stable job and money.

When I post a ""thirst trap"" (selfie looking good) he posts one that same day or the day after lol

He told me he's bad at texting before this issue began. However I've seen him text his friends during our ""dates"".

He says his best friend is hyped about him getting with me. And he also tried to impress my friends (girl and guy) and be extra nice to them. My girl friend says he's just shy and we are misjudging him, and my guy friend says he's a narcissist and a POS (the guy friend wants me so idk about that opinion).

Help, please.

"Can‚Äôt keep a girl‚Äôs interest My whole life ode struggled with anxiety and the fear of talking to girls. As I‚Äôm sure lots of guys have. In my 20‚Äôs now, and while I‚Äôve had fun here and there, anytime it comes to a relationship I just feel like no one I‚Äôve been into hasn‚Äôt been into me. Even girls that I do date, always brake it off after no more than a few weeks. Months if I‚Äôm lucky. 

Fast forward to now, this girl I was just recently seeing is amazing and I wanted a relationship but before I even told her how I felt she told me she wants to be just friends. Anyways, any time we hung out and she talks about her past flings or boyfriends and they all seem like biggest assholes.  She‚Äôd tell me stories about how they mainly force their ways into relationships and other ‚Äúactivities‚Äù. For example she told about this one guy who sounded awful for the way he treated her, but then when she talks about them being romantic or how he‚Äôd just kiss her without asking or start doing sexual stuff without really asking because they think it‚Äôs romantic or attractive that the man is taking what he wants and ect. 

It just upsets me bc I feel like that‚Äôs what girls want.  I don‚Äôt want to believe the stigma around the whole ‚Äúgirls love assholes‚Äù thing bc that‚Äôs just not who I am. I can‚Äôt just start making out with a girl if she‚Äôs crying bc my anxiety and consideration for others always stops me from doing stuff like that. I just feel like they always go back to these kinds of guys. They just lose interest in me. Anyways, I felt like I pushed her away because Im not like those kinds of guys. Not just her, but lots of girls I‚Äôve been into tell me stuff like this and it just makes me feel like im not going to find someone unless im some asshole gym bro who just wants sex.",Parzival_43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15fi0e6/cant_keep_a_girls_interest/,1690908748.0,0.5

"(27M) dating a single mom (36f) with 2 boys (5/7) - ADVICE? Howdy!

Just wanted to pop in here and see what y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinion is of how things are going in this new-ish relationship. This is such a new territory for me being younger and I felt this would be a good spot to breakdown what has happened so far and get y‚Äôall‚Äôs take on it. 


Bio:

Me: 27M, no kids, never married, got out of a long relationship 8 months ago, no relationships in between, works in real estate and I do really well for myself financially. I have always wanted a family, I just needed to get my career right and my last relationship just wasn‚Äôt the right fit with that. 

Her: 36F, 2 boys (5/7), married for 6 years, divorced for 2.5 years, no relationships in between, only seriously interested in one guy prior to me, works in real estate and does enough to get by financially. Her divorce ended mostly because her ex changed and became a POS. He barely sees the kids for 6hrs/wk and every other weekend. 


Background: 

Met on a deal we worked together in April, when it closed she messaged me on FB and gave me her number in case I wanted to work together again. I shot her a text and we hit it off. We started texting a ton and had a lot of fun conversations. We had a business coffee meeting the week after and then scheduled our first date. Drinks after work. I met her kids pretty quickly in the process too. Her kids love me and they are amazing, we get along great and they are a blast. Ex is POS who barely sees them and does not follow his custody orders all the time. He will be late with picking them up and delay things. Custody orders state that another guy can not sleep over with kids present until they go through a vetting process, we have not done that yet. I have passed out a few times with the kids there and no issues have popped up but she makes it very clear I can not spend the night. 


Timeline: 

4/6: closed the deal together and saw her in person for the first time. 
4/19: she gave me her number and we started texting. 
5/4: first coffee business meeting. 
5/9: first meeting with drinks. 
5/11: date playing darts/drinks. 
5/14: met kids and we went bowling. 
5/20: first night at her place alone and we had sex. 
-dates, lunches and time with kids in between-
6/9: she marked she was in a relationship on FB. 
6/16-18: first weekend alone with her at her place, lots of sex. 
6/22: she removed her relationship on FB. 
6/25: weekend with kids and we took them to Six Flags together. 
7/1: first time she came to my house for a bit, had sex again. 
7/2: old fling popped back up. 
7/3: she chose me over him, sex again. 
7/15-16: weekend with kids, shopping and indoor skydiving. 
7/21-23: she was out of town visiting a girlfriend the whole weekend, didn‚Äôt see her at all. 
7/28-31: spent 4 days with her and the kids straight. First time she let me take one of the kids fishing for a bit with just me an him. Each night I stayed until I help them fall asleep, it was a great weekend. 


How our relationship is:

We really get along well, relate to each other with work and we love our sense of humor together. There haven‚Äôt been any major fights or disagreements yet (besides the old fling who tried to come back and she turned him away). Sex is tough as there is not a lot of free time with us and she does not feel comfortable with the kids being in the same house as us, hard for her to get in the mood. I have been financially supporting them a bit since we have been together. I pay for everything when we go out places, I‚Äôve gave her some money when things pop up and she is tight on cash. I don‚Äôt mind supporting them and she has never once asked me for money or anything, I do it voluntarily. Long term wise, she has mentioned it will be awhile before she considers getting married again and I am okay with that, gotta make sure it‚Äôll work out before rushing into that. Her kids want a baby sister but she is getting older. She did not shoot down the idea and I am open to it in the future as well. With that said, if she only wants to have her 2 kids, I am fine with that. Having my own is not as important as being a good father to someone if things get that far. With her youngest being 5, it is enticing having the kids already being 18 by the time I am 40 myself. We are both on the same page religiously and politically. Her friends and family know of me already. We have tried to make plans twice to see her friends but something popped up with them and it got canceled. She does not have a huge social circle (I do not either) but we will both meet each others friends soon. 


Questions:

1- How do you think the relationship is progressing so far? Is it moving too fast or is there something I should be concerned about?

2- Would a single mom let me get this close to her kids if she does not see a long term future with me? I am super close to them now. 

3- She sent me the FB relationship invite first and then removed it herself 2 weeks later. When I eventually asked her about it, she said that she did not want it to interfere with our careers since we‚Äôre both in the same field. I still have my profile as ‚Äúin a relationship‚Äù but she has no relationship info showing. Any ideas here?

4- Sex has been great when we have it. Since we started dating we have had sex 5 times over 2 months. It‚Äôs just hard with her schedule. The only real times we could get are every other weekend or maybe slip something in during her lunch break. Given our busy lives, should we be having more sex than we are or is it going to be this sporadic until we eventually move in together? Is there something I should try to do like schedule it out? It‚Äôs now been 4 weeks since we have slept together or had any alone time. There was a five week gap between the first time we had sex and the 3 times we had it in the last 2 week period. Single/dating moms help!!

5- Texting has went from 100-200 texts/day during the first 1.5 months, to 50 texts/day over the last 1.5 months. Maybe we just got out of our honeymoon phase quick? She eventually always replies to me and we usually talk from morning to bed time. Any ideas?

6- How do things seem to be going overall?

"Was He 24/m Planning to Cheat on Me 24/f 
Hey guys. I (24F) and my bf (24M) have been officially together for 3 months. I won‚Äôt lie, things have been pretty rocky but we resolve problems efficiently and communicate very well. Unfortunately, this event has strained our relationship to what I think is the point of no return. 

On the day of my bf birthday I had to work so we both agreed it would be best if he visited me on my lunch break. He texted me he was on his way, which normally takes 30 minutes. It ended up taking him an hour and a half. When he came to see me, I asked him what took so long and he said traffic. It was 11:30pm on a Wednesday so I felt uneasy but brushed it off. I asked if he wanted to get frisky and he declined, which again seemed odd to me. 

He had a new crossbody bag, which I asked him about and he showed me what was in it. I asked what he had in there and he showed me but refused to show me what was in the inner most pouch of it. He finally caves in and there are an old pack of unopened condoms and 6/7 condoms not in a box. I asked him about it and he said he was transferring everything from his old bag to his new one and put the condoms in there. He said he did not really think about it. I immediately freaked out and got out the car. We never use condoms and I couldn‚Äôt understand why he would put them in a new bag that he carries around all day. I told him I did not want to speak him anymore and went back to work. He would not allow me to go back so I had to run inside. I blocked him on everything. I ended up leaving work early because I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking and crying.

My male coworker was also leaving early and offered me a ride to my car.  I accepted it and as we drove to my car, we saw my ex parked next to it, sitting on top of his car. I got out of my coworkers car, went to my car and my bf was there telling me how he wanted to ‚Äúfight for me.‚Äù I left and went home.

I called him the next day and he was livid. He said I had trust issues and that I shouldn‚Äôt have blocked him. He does not like my male coworker and was upset that he gave me a ride to my car. Rightfully so, because my male coworker has a crush on me and tries to contact me outside of work but I keep things strictly professional. He ended up apologizing for having the condoms, telling me how I knew he had condoms, and that he wanted to speak in person. I agreed and we met the next day.

I told him I didn‚Äôt understand why he felt the need to pack condoms in his new bag and he said he wasn‚Äôt thinking and was just rushing to transfer over the items. He then suggested we break up because I‚Äôm toxic and have major trust issues. He said I was trying to find a reason to break up with him because I expressed I had some doubts about the relationship. We ended up making up and trying to make the relationship work.

After this, I found out not even 24 hours after our breakup, he slid in a girls dm that I had asked if they had something going on because he liked all her pictures. He also reached out 2 female friends that he has never mentioned before and let them know we had broken up. I had a bad feeling because these people showed up out of the blue and he immediately started talking to them, asking them for advice and falling asleep on the phone with one of them. I can‚Äôt be mad because we were broken up but it makes me uneasy. I also found out he told all his friends and family and they encouraged him to break up with me because I‚Äôm toxic.

My mind is scrambled. I will admit I‚Äôm not proud of my actions and that I am insecure and have trust issues that I am working on.

TD;RL: I broke up with my bf because I found condoms in his bag and we got back together but now I feel uneasy.

"I(23M) don't know if I got my hookup(23F) pregnant. Her communication has been terrible Yea i know, if it says negative then we should be good but I need help.

TL;DR- Hookup didn't get her period. Took 3 pregnancy test that all came back negative. She informs me that something similar has happened to her before and when it did, she found out she was 2 months pregnant. Now I'm confused on what to do since her communication is spotty.

I'm a 23 year old male still in college. I had sex with an old friend (22F), well call her Tay. Me and tay had sex on the 31st of May. Like a dumbass, I didn't use a condom.  While I don't remember fully cumming in her, I still got her a plan B. She immediately took it after sex. I was worried later that the plan b wouldn't work as she weights over 200 pounds. However, she told me she had taken plan b before and it worked. May 31st was the only time we had sex.

She texted me on July 8th and told me she never got her period (despite her telling me she was on it on June 14th when I was laying with her so idk wtf she's talking about.) But she said it had been over a month since she had her period. I told her to take a pregnancy test and she took one on the 8th of July. The test came back negative. She however then told me she was still worried, so she took 2 more pregnancy test on the 10th of July. Both came back negative.

You may think its over right? I thought so too, however, she is still worried and we had a talk. I told her that at this point its been 6 weeks since we had sex (as of july 10th). If she was pregnant the tests would more than likely show it (I know this isn't always true, but more than likely it is). I also told her that it was normal for the plan b to mess up her cycle, and make the period take longer to come. I told her at this point, she will need to go to the doctor and see what they say. This is where the problem comes in:

She then informed me that was not necessarily true. She then informs me that in the past before me, she has taken pregnancy test before and had them come back negative, AND she ended up being 2 months pregnant. She also said that her cousin has taken a plan b before and still ended up pregnant.

Im getting concerned but irritated because of many things: for 1, her communication around all of this has been really subpar. I've had to tell her to call me multiple times to get the details surrounding all of this, and she has hesitated to to that. She keeps just wanting to text. I understand she works, but this is serious and there is no excuse for us to not be able to be responsible adults and talk about this when she is off work. On top of that, I also warned her about the possibilities about the plan b not working on her, and she brushed it off to me being paranoid. Now that we are facing down the barrel of reality, it finally starts to hit her.  I really would have liked to know about her getting pregnant before, as I would then expect to understand that some times, a pregnancy test may not be 100% accurate for her. Also, I keep telling her she needs to go to the doctor soon, and she just keeps saying she'll get to it eventually. I'm like wtf is wrong with you? You aren't that damn busy for something like this. I even called around and got her a free blood pregnancy test and ultrasound appointment. I told her about it and she never responded.

She got an abortion before (Just this year. She just informed me of that too). She is familiar with the process, and said there were programs and other sources to help in the case we cannot afford one. I'm not sure if these ""sources"" will cover a second abortion for the same year.

The last time we talked was July 11th. As of July 30th, I have not heard anything from her. She has still been posting on social media, but has not said anything to me since then.

Do yall thinks she could be pregnant? What do I tell her to make her go to the doctor sooner rather than later? She said she promises to keep me updated, but how do I instill in her she needs to stay on the ball on this? Should I just drop it at this point?

Edit: So there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about how often im actually contacting this girl. To be clear, this is not a situation of me ""annoying"" this girl.

"I NEED ADVICE I‚Äôve lived with my roommate for 3 years. she‚Äôs about the same age of me or a bit younger. I‚Äôve had feelings for her for a while but I respected the fact that we live together and didn‚Äôt pursue it further.

We do and did hangout from time to time at some point our bond became really strong and we were hanging out a lot but then it turns awkward and she ends up going back to her room.

I used to hit on her and lightly touch her and she didn‚Äôt mind.

I think at some point we gave a lot of hints to each and she told me I liked this guy but wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs actually talking about me but it was a reference to something we talked about I told her I went on a couple dates which I haven‚Äôt done in a while but I told her I like this girl but for some reason I can‚Äôt tell her and wouldn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for her.

I‚Äôm a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can‚Äôt seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we‚Äôve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn‚Äôt know what to do!

She‚Äôs travelling for a year now and she said she‚Äôll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I‚Äôm extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she‚Äôs been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn‚Äôt tell her since she doesn‚Äôt want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a creep and awkward


She‚Äôs leaving now in 2 weeks. It‚Äôs been eating me from inside I want to get it off my chest. Id love for her to feel the same but if not it doesn‚Äôt really matter. But I‚Äôm really sad and feel it every night. I‚Äôve been crying for a couple days now and feel depressed and she noticed that I‚Äôm really sad.

Is it too late should I tell her, or should I let it go. I think I also wanted to make sure that I have feelings for her that‚Äôs beyond attraction She‚Äôs so sweet and I like her and don‚Äôt know why my dumbass never made a move.

"Venting about a date I'm a 26m, went on a date the other day.
I had some money set back cause the date was planned a week ahead of time, so I had $120 (usd). I told him that we could do whatever or go wherever and that I didn't know him well enough to plan it well without discounting him. 

We just drive around a while and ended up just getting fast food (25ish dollars from a Hardee's)

We went to a park to eat and chat and there were like, two guys just walking around being odd. The dude I'm with says ""they are just cruising"" I had to ask what that meant and be awkward as fk, and the two dudes kept staring at us. The dude I'm with finally decides to drove away after like 30 min of sitting there. (I felt like he may have knew them or something, cause he acted weird).

He was looking at his phone most the date looking at others on different dating apps, he didn't seem to care about much I said and most the date seemed to be him either venting on his job (which doesn't bother me usually) or the aforementioned phone scrolling. How I know what he was looking at is... he showed me, like almost proud of it. I've never felt so small in my life. I just played it off and tried to brush past it.

I'm not proud of it, but we ended up somewhere secluded and etc etc etc. 

I tried talking with him after and it seemed like he was not interested. 

I didn't really post this for any reason beyond trying to understand how I feel by writing this out and trying to deal with my emotions on it. I deleted that dating app cause after being on it fir a while and everyone basically fell into *wanting to marry after 2 weeks of chatting on an app* or *use you and drop you in less then 2 dates while pretending to be interested, to then ghost you*.

I'm gonna take a good long break from trying to date. I've got a lot of things to work on before I feel comfortable trying to, I dunno, flounder around?

"I‚Äôm feeling insecure about my sex life and relationship with my girlfriend I (28M) have been with my gf (30f) for about 3.5 years now. She is my first gf. In high school I never had the confidence to talk to girls and have relationships. I was always focused on school and extracurricular activities. Even in college, I didn‚Äôt have any relationships or hook ups either I did lose my virginity to my high school friend in college and she was also my first kiss. It wasn‚Äôt until after college I started working and got into online dating is when I finally start. I had a lot of Situationships with girls. And a lot of them even would be surprised when I told them I‚Äôve never had a relationship before they all said I was very good looking and very charming.

My girlfriend on the other hand, had a very different experience growing up. She had high school relationships, high school hook ups, college relationships, college hook ups.  She has definitely had a lot more hook ups than I have. She only has one more sexual partner than I have. She‚Äôs done the whole sneaking out at night to go see her boyfriend, looking up at the movies, trying different sexual experiences (car sex, shower sex, etc.) 

What makes me insecure is that I haven‚Äôt had a lot of these experiences growing up. My security isn‚Äôt so much that she has been with other people because I have also been with other people it‚Äôs more so that she had a lot of these experiences growing up since high school college whereas I only had like a few experiences later in life. 

What can I do to be more confident about myself. I am a good looking person or at least that‚Äôs what a lot of girls have told me. They have also told me I‚Äôm very charming. Even my girlfriend was surprised when I told her I‚Äôve never had a relationship before because of how my nature is.

"I think that I was not my ex‚Äôs type We met online and he seemed like the man I have been looking for all my life. I was extremely hesitant about starting something long distance, but he convinced me that we were meant for each other and that finding a connection like ours was extremely rare. 

He repeatedly told me that I was his type. However, only 2-3 days after we had formally met in real life for the first time (and been intimate with each other), he commented on my body, saying that it was obvious that I did not work out and that I had bad posture (which is something I have never heard in my entire life), while simultaneously telling me that I needed to eat more to be healthier. I was by no means fat or heavy, I am just tall (not petite) and I did not go to the gym, so my body was not toned. He had very manipulative tendencies and would lie to me about the smallest things any chance he would get. He was so cold towards me when we were together. I blamed myself and thought that I was doing something wrong or that I was not good enough. At the same time, he was talking about how we were going to get married and telling me that he wanted me to move in with him and have his kids. Make it make sense. 

I have realised now that all his exes before me were petite brunettes and so is his current girlfriend, who was already moved in with him 7 months after I broke up with him. I am starting to think that I was never really his type and that he was not attracted to me, and that that is the real reason why he treated me the way he did. Why did he pursue me then? Why did he not end it himself earlier? Why did he introduce me to his family? Why did he try so hard to convince me that this would work? He should have left me alone. He is happy now with his gorgeous new girlfriend and here I am, still trying to process what even happened between us and going to therapy because of him.

we are both working professionals honestly with master's degrees and similar work experiences, so really i was only ever going to talk about those commonalities and see if he wanted to connect, if not, cool, best of luck. i would never do something like ""HELLO I SAW YOU IN INTERNET, YOU GO ON DATE WITH ME?""

We have a lot of mutual friends so we technically know about each other. I say I kind of attractive but cannot say I'm beautiful. You will not fall in love with me at first sight. So here is the thing, 3 years ago this guy asked one of my close friends if I had a bf, knowing this from my friend I asked her to tell me that I had a bf although I didn't since at that time my love life so complicated to the point I don't want to be in a relationship. But I was curious about him and kind of investigated his posts. I think I kind of like his vibe and perspective of the world. And also he is kinda cute. so I will say I develop a little crush on him but it was never that serious. And recently when I'm about to forget about him he again asked my friend if I still have a bf. I don't know what she said to him since she thought I'm not interested in that anymore, she never tell me, and I didn't ask back about it. The thing is I'm even afraid to face him, I'm not in my best condition with my sudden breakout with pimples, pimple marks, dark spots, skinnier etc. And I believe I'm a little photogenic in photos but not in real life pretty. Plus I'm having a dark skin tone than in the photos. To meet my biggest fear I met this guy in real life the other day. I was uncomfortable since I wasn't confident. I don't even know if he recognized me. But I'm pretty sure he figured out seeing with my friend since he knows her too. He still never chats with me about anything.

"I (19M) am considered a fairly attractive man but women act as if they‚Äôre scared of me I try and talk with girls at the gym, school, clubs, rarely at the mall and I usually get told ‚ÄúSorry I have a boyfriend!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lesbian‚Äù. When I try to keep things platonic with girls many treat me like a 40 yr old creep and get nervous even though I didn‚Äôt do anything, how is it now that I‚Äôve made myself attractive I have even worse luck with women?

To describe myself I‚Äôm ripped, have nice face/hair, dress well, decent confidence and great hygiene. When I look in the mirror I think I look amazing and would totally date me, but then I go out in public and most of the time this loneliness has reminded me why I might die alone without ever having experienced the dating life other guys my age do.

I feel like dating apps will make me even more miserable, especially if I put my height down (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8). I‚Äôve only been with one girl and it wasn‚Äôt even a relationship, she was 27 and we spent a night together and had fun. However I realized she traveled a lot and did the same with many other men on a 1 to 2 month basis, my confidence plummeted after I found this out.

Being alone for so long has made me bitter honestly and I just want my life to change. When I was butt ugly I had more success with girls and had more friends around me, now that‚Äôs changed and I‚Äôm an outsider to everyone. People look at me and get intimidated or scared and I‚Äôve done everything to be likeable socially but I just don‚Äôt fit in anyway.

"Online Dating and Weight Loss How important it is to tell someone that you‚Äôve been talking to (online) that you‚Äôve lost a lot of weight?
I‚Äôve naturally lost over 100 pounds the past 1.5years, and I‚Äôm still on my weight loss journey.

"How do you make your boyfriend's ex get over him? Hi me (21) and my boyfriend (22) were walking on the street last week when we saw and met his ex again.


 They exchanged a few greetings and life updates, and i also greeted her (i knew her way back in highschool because all of the 3 of us graduated in the same school. We weren't exactly the friends type because i only knew her through our mutual friends). And that night when we came home and settled down for bed, his ex messaged my boyfriend consulted me and showed me their convo.


 In the convo she said that she still wasn't gotten over him and she still loves him. But can't do anything about taking him back because i am here, his girlfriend. My boyfriend rejected her and draws boundaries that they won't be together again but his ex is just persistent. 


I got mad and took over my boyfriend's phone to talk to her not knowing it was me who was she talking to. I got her to say the reason why she hasn't ""moved on"" after all these years and she said some pretty much depressing reasons. 


Now this situation where my boyfriend's ex still wants him bugs me as a girlfriend, i mean who wouldn't right? I trust my boyfriend as he is a great man. But as a woman, i really want her to stop liking my man and get over him. But again, she said some pretty depressing reasons why she hasn't moved on and i'm afraid this might ruin her mentally or anything.    I'm not going to disclose any information about her for confidentiality and as a respect for her too. 


And now i feel hurt for her as a fellow woman but what she's doing isn't healthy for her. My boyfriend tells me to stop feeling sorry for her and that we should just focus on chasing her away but i can't. I've seen a similar situation as her from one of my close friends and i know how devastating it can be. It destroyed my close friend, and it will also destroy her (ex).


So the point is, how do i make my boyfriend's ex get over him without the cost of her insanity? Should i just stop being empathic for her?",Foreign_Reaction_888,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f7a7e/how_do_you_make_your_boyfriends_ex_get_over_him/,1690881544.0,0.5

"Intense anxiety and guilt surrounding doing anything sexual is stopping me from losing my virginity 
I‚Äôm a 25 year old guy who‚Äôs a virgin for reference. I was always an ugly duckling, terrified to flirt because I didn‚Äôt want to be a creep, etc., but I‚Äôm a late bloomer and the last few years I‚Äôve really grown into myself, become a bit more confident and stuff too. I get a good amount of matches on tinder, and I‚Äôve had quite a few women flirt with me more and more recently. Women have approached me in clubs and bars a couple of times, I‚Äôve had women from tinder say they‚Äôre down to hook up and date, my friend told one girl while we were drunk that I was a virgin and she gave me her number and told me to meet her later and she‚Äôd happily ‚Äòteach me a few things‚Äô, etc.

But I can‚Äôt stop getting in my own way. I have this really intense, almost intrusive irrational anxiety about being a creep, violating someone‚Äôs consent, etc., and I don‚Äôt know where it stems from. I think I have such a deep belief that I‚Äôm not sexually attractive that I have this anxious belief that any time someone‚Äôs interested in me, that it can‚Äôt be real, and that I‚Äôd be doing something wrong by disrespecting that. It‚Äôs like insanely low self worth. It used to be easy to rationalise this; I didn‚Äôt get much romantic attention, so it didn‚Äôt matter what I felt. Now I do, and I‚Äôll be happily talking to someone, or getting to know them, and it turns sexual and suddenly I need to get out of it.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs asexuality, I want to have sex. I‚Äôm just scared. And any time something does happen I feel intense guilt. I‚Äôve made out with a few girls now, and every time I have intense guilt after. I replay it in my head the next day, wondering if it was all okay, if I went too far, if maybe they didn‚Äôt actually want to, even though like every time they initiated it or kissed me because I was too scared to kiss them. 

Last week I had a really explicit example; I was in a club and this girl literally just told me I‚Äôm cute, we talked for a few minutes, she told me she wanted to kiss me and we ended up making out for quite a while. She was clearly really into it; the kissing got really intense, we were both grabbing each other, she was basically grinding herself against me while we made out and like lifting her leg up over me to get as close as possible lmfao. We pulled away a couple of times and just kept going back in. After that she said ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love if we could fuck right now‚Äô, but then my friends told me they were leaving. They said they get it if I decided to stay, but I left with them. The next day I was terrified because what if she wanted me to stop? What if she was too drunk, or I‚Äôd taken advantage or something (I was really drunk too). Like I don‚Äôt think any of that‚Äôs the case rationally; it was a drunken makeout where we both just got a little carried away. It happens. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like dirty and like I done something wrong.

I don‚Äôt know where it comes from. It‚Äôs like intense guilt surrounding sex, like it‚Äôs something i shouldn‚Äôt be doing, or like women can‚Äôt like me enough to want that from me, so my brain decides I must be a creep for even wanting to or enjoying it. There‚Äôs been other times too where someone‚Äôs made a move on me and I just feel so creepy for reciprocating, and usually they‚Äôre incredibly blatant about wanting something to happen. I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm like this.",Mr_Jek,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eu184/intense_anxiety_and_guilt_surrounding_doing/,1690842158.0,1.0
"ME (26M) CAN'T GET OVER MY EX GIRLFRIEND (21F) In 2022, I `(26M)` broke up with G `(21F)` who was 20y.o at the time. We had been through a lot of arguing, fighting which had seen the us being involved in a **break-up and make up pattern** which started 2019. Though last year marked the end of our relationship, I find it hard to get over her. Since the break up, I have been emotionally drained, angry and broken. In all honesty, I still love her and what makes it harder is the more I try to come to terms with our breakup the harder it becomes. I even tried telling her how I felt and try to seek closure but it all seemed to make it hard. I sometimes try cutting off contact with her and a part of me would miss her. Even if I manage to cut off contact with her, she would call after a month or even two. I even tried dating other girls but there was **no connection** of any type. **Moving on has been impossible and the more I tried the harder it hurt**.

"How should I (M26) approach reconnecting with my ex (F21) after a toxic breakup, considering the timing, distance, and past issues, while focusing on personal growth and respecting her need for space? I am in a MD/MBA student in US. She is in one of the best engineering programs in Girona.  
So the last thing I heard from my ex is that:

1. She doesn't know if she loves me anymore
2. She doesn't want to make any decisions about us as she's going to China for study abroad for the summer.
3. She wants space and no contact
4. She made it clear that she can't do a Long Distance Closed Relationship

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up in December of last year. A lot of toxicity on my part. The breaking point was someone who failed medical school sent me a voice note of my ""ex cheating"" and I confronted her about it. She broke down crying cuz I didnt believe her with this ""clear evidence"". Literally like two weeks ago, this dude admitted that it was him. I cant believe it. This is such weird and high school like shit but medical school is like that. A bunch of weirdos. They do anything so that you fail or to distract your peace and she mentioned that it was him so I tripled fucked up. Completely fucked up.

  
What an asshat. A jealous pr\*\*\*  
Anyway, thats my loss.

  
I am looking to move on. I tried having casual sex and didnt like it. I've been in therapy which has been good for me mentally. I've cut ties with these fake friends and only depend on really good friends of mine. I accept to give her space and tons of it. I might not speak to her again. I also dont know what to do with this dude who did this shit. Im at a lot of words that he would do something like this knowing how much I liked this person. Claimed to do it for my own good ""long distance relationships are fake and she will cheat"" I still have no idea how to address this, this is absurd.

  
Anyway, back to the question:

  
I may have opportunities to visit more often. Weeks/months at time even. Making very good money while still saving on housing and etc. and while im in school definitely twice a semester. This is something that I will do for her cuz my life is better with her.

  
The distance and my toxicity, and the baggage of jealous friends I think I can fix and work on. I'll continue therapy and etc.

  
So here is where I need advice. Since right now, I dont have the means to see her I wont bother her. Ill maintain space.  
If my situation changes, which it could very well. And I have the finances and time to see her, I wonder if reaching out would be appropriate.

1. My dad suggested I waited until 2 years when we both are done with school. This would allow us to make actual adult decision as the distance doesn't work for either of us.
2. We broke up in December so I dont know if giving it a year would be best or give it like a year since we met in person. Which was late September.
3. Just give up lol.  


My plan, if I decide to reach out, would be to ask if she'd like to meet up for coffee and have a face-to-face conversation instead of relying on Facetime or texts. I believe that being in person might show that things can be different and more meaningful.

  
Additionally, I'm not sure if I should bring up the false cheating claim made by a friend. It's a strange situation, and I don't want to create unnecessary drama.  
For now, I'm prioritizing my personal growth and healing, whether we reconcile or not. If we do decide to give it another shot, I want to do it with a healthier mindset.

  
TL;DR: After a breakup caused by my own toxic behavior and a friend's false cheating claim, I'm considering reconnecting with my ex when I can visit her more. Unsure about timing and how to broach past issues, I'm focusing on personal growth and respecting her wish for distance.

"Dating in the Western world... Western culture has always been applauded as progressive amongst all the different cultures of the world. So it is a big surprise to find that other cultures are actually more progressive than the Western culture in this age and time, especially when it comes to dating.

Traditional norms centered around a boy seeing a girl, asking others about her, getting to know her and then finally going to meet her parents for her hand in marriage. Nowadays that isn't the case anymore. People are ""more civilized"". But sometimes you sit and ask yourself; ""have things really changed for the better, or are we just doing the same thing with a different approach?""

This can be said to be true for the Western culture. Nowadays, following the Western culture, a man sees a woman. In most cases he can't approach her because either the law doesn't allow it or he gives an excuse stating that no one does that anymore. Women as well don't approach men stating that women fear rejection more. This isn't true. People fear things they haven't done before in most cases. So if a man has never approached a woman before, he will fear rejection more than a woman who has approached men.

If traditional norms of women cooking and cleaning is dead, why shouldn't the expectations of men approaching women and taking them out die as well? When a man manages to approach a woman or meet her online, he has to chat for weeks and months, and go on 10 dates before getting a kiss, and 10 more before getting a hand job. This doesn't happen in other cultures around the world. So, if that's the case, which culture can be said to be progressive? 

Why not just be more civilized? Everyone knows what they want. Why deceive yourself by going on 30+ dates just to know someone. Some chat for months before deciding to go on dates. Who has such amount of time to waste. After spending years and countless dates, they end up dating and getting married only to divorce in a few years. The so-called uncivilized cultures spend a few days and start dating and they get married and most never divorce.

"How to invite a girl out after meeting her Hello Redditors. I met this really charming girl at a festival this weekend. I usually dont have it in me to talk to many girls, but i couldnt let this one get away. We smalltalked a bit and ended up dancing a while before she went to her again. I didnt feel like it was appropriate to ask her out there and then. I  also met her the day after, where basically the same thing happened. Some small talk and dancing, for her to go back go her friends. I should have probably asked her out then.

I did however take the chance and asked to follow her and instagram, which she accepted and asked me back. Therefore i was wondering of sending her a text. I was thinking of something like ""Hi! I really enjoyed meeting you and dancing with you this weekend despite my bad efforts. Are you back at work or are you still on vacation?"". The bad effort dancing was a thing we small talked about.

"Am I overthinking things with this girl I‚Äôve been talking to the past month and a half? I‚Äôve been dating this girl for a month and a half now. We see each other every weekend and we have great chemistry. We spend the whole weekend together laughing, cooking food for each other, cuddling, going on dates, watching movies etc. However, her texting recently has progressively gotten worse. 

Initially, we would send multiple messages per day, and towards the evening we would start exchanging back and forth texting for a little bit before bed. Then it started to fade towards a few texts per day, to just good morning and good night texts. Now, I sometimes don‚Äôt get anything back from her for over two days. Currently haven‚Äôt heard from her in over a day after just being at her place on Sunday. 

But the thing is, she‚Äôs actively making plans for us to do on weekends. For example, she invited me to come over her place this weekend. We are very intimate together, she‚Äôs introduced me to her friends and hangout with them often. It‚Äôs known to them that we have something going on as we hold hands in front of them or I have my arm around her.

I really like this girl and we haven‚Äôt talked too much about our expectations and wants. The last time we did was about a month ago when she asked me what was going on between us. Deep down I wanted to say let's be exclusive, but I didn't want to scare her off after only talking two weeks at that time. So, I said I'm just going with the flow and seeing where things go, but that I enjoy spending my time with her. She said the same, and I followed up by asking if we're dating other people. She said that we can, but if we do we'd just have to let each other know. 

She's a great person and we get along so well IRL, but I just wish I could get some more communication out of her when we're not together physically. And we're not official yet, so I know she doesn't owe me anything, but it just makes me unwanted. Then I go into a spiral of thinking worst case scenarios in my head, and that she's over me or talking to someone else. I'm aware I have this anxious attachment style, and I really am working to fixing this. Maybe the next time I should bring this topic up with her again and tell her I really like her since it's been a bit longer now? 

TLDR: things are going great in person and she actively makes plans to see me on weekends, but as time has passed, her texting has gotten worse.",coolbeans227,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15f5jou/am_i_overthinking_things_with_this_girl_ive_been/,1690875631.0,1.0
"I never get a second date and I don‚Äôt know why. There‚Äôs something about me (36f) that men don‚Äôt like. I can‚Äôt figure it out. I get lots of dates. I go on lots of dates. But usually after the first date men seem interested but slow fade, ghost me or ask me on a second date but then cancel. 

My female friends tell me that I‚Äôm wifey material, my guy friends think I‚Äôm awesome (no they‚Äôre not single), I am well liked in my community, and men are always telling me how pretty I am, so it has to be something about my personality.

I just can‚Äôt figure it out. I‚Äôve been single a long time and I am so lonely, I feel unlovable at this point after going on 80+ dates the past 5 years and have nothing stick. Not even friendships coming out of it. 

How can I figure out why men don‚Äôt like me?

"I cannot understand dating women hey everyone, 
little about me I‚Äôve been solo traveling for a while now, been great so far in terms of socializing, meeting friends, girls, etc.

I‚Äôve had quite a few ons in this trip which is great because there‚Äôs no commitment and you‚Äôll never think about them anymore and it‚Äôs just about having fun.

Although I met this one girl from a different country than me on my last night in a city, my type, great smile(my weakness), likable social typa person. night was great but cut short because she drank a lot.. she wanted me to stay another night in the city and was sincerely happy when I said I extended for one more night.
her friend also let me know that the girl was into me so I was even more excited to try to make things happen.
We went out the night after, everything was great, we did it, cuddled and chatted about how nice the night was. 
After that I went to another city but ofc I wanted to see her again(she also said that I should come, that she misses me) because I assumed there‚Äôs a little bit of potential out of it.
when I changed my routes to see her, and even when I got to the city she was at, she was a little bit colder, sometimes took 16-22 hours to respond.
 one day she went out but she said I could come if I want to but I said nah that‚Äôs not an invitation. 
The day after she told me she wanted to see me that night and will never forgive herself if she doesn‚Äôt see me here.
the other day we did meet, had a picnic with wine, she complimented me all the time, we laughed, we had some open talks, went to a ferris wheel and listened to her earphones music together, made out, made stupid funny selfies and pictures, just like in the movies. we chatted about meeting the day after,
but the day after she disappeared for like the whole day and would not respond, then in the night she wanted to stay home and not go out. It was her last night, so I asked if I see her before she leaves, she said ye tomorrow midday before she takes the train. I said great let‚Äôs see each other an hour before and
she never responded again.

I was never played as great as this time, since I got all these compliments from her multiple times about my personality, my looking, my humor, my style, my smell, figured out she‚Äôs very into from her friend, and what? tryna avoid me in a way and not reach out to meet as much as I tried or even meet for a goodbye.

"Confused 26 M 27 F Im confused....

im so confused....  I thought this girl at work liked me... we sit by each other, she isn't a manager or a higher position, simply another co worker who works in a different department. Our teams just sit with each other. For weeks on end we had this back and forth looking at each other ""game"". eye contact, holding eye contact, smiles etc. She made is very obvious of her looking at me.  I always sat a seat behind her and to her right. She would make it obvious of her turning around to look at me then once I ""caught"" her she turned around super fast. Things like this happened for like a month straight. I got the courage to start talking to her for past couple weeks and so far she seems genuinely happy to talk to me, by her voice, her smile etc. BUT this is where im so confused. I texted her asking her how's she's doing because she didn't come into the office. She IGNORED my message for the second time and left me on read..... everyone at works uses the work messenger which is Microsoft teams. This was the first time texting her in a month because the first time she ignored my first message. Even at the very beginning when I texted her after meeting her for the first time, she wasn't short but has short responses. At the time I brushed it off. Ive made other friends from her team she's on and me and them casually text each other during the day. BUT when it comes to her, she doesent reply.... like do you know how to talk? text? communicate? this isn't hard.... like hello? What does it mean when a girl shows interest to you in person but when it comes to messages at work they act the complete opposite??

"How to tell a girl that I don't want to continue seeing her if she doesn't want to commit? **EDIT: I realize now that the title is a bit misleading. To tell her I don't want to see her is one of the options I've laid out for myself, but if you think that there are better options out there, please tell me!**

Hi. I'm a 21 year old guy with who's been in a few relationships in the past. It seems that I've put myself in a textbook ""situationship"".

This girl (21) and I, we've spent a lot of time together over the past month. I've taken her on dates, been to her place, been intimate, etc. It's great. When we're together I can tell that we're both really happy. Her personality and physical appearance is everything I could ask for in a girl. I've been out of relationships for the past 2 years, working on myself as a person, and finally feel like I could be with someone. I have truly grown a lot and I feel like this girl is the one I could see myself committing to. It's something along the lines of... ""don't let a good thing go when you see it.""

Only one issue arises when thinking about this girl. After seeing her many times, I finally ask the question: ""are you looking for something serious or not serious?"" She tells me that she doesn't want anything serious at the moment. Pretty soon (November) she'll be out of the country for a few months and she doesn't want to deal with the long distance. Plus, I feel at the moment like she would be single rather than committed to one thing. I totally get all of it. I don't knock her for it at all. Initially, I was like ""ok, I'm glad we're on the same page now! I understand."" I was, at the time, willing to face the repercussions of getting into a casual, short term fling with someone because she made me really happy.

But honestly, it's been eating at me. Genuinely, the way she makes me feel is indescribable. I have seen many girls in the last two years, but none have compared to this. My brain is screaming at me. This is what you've been waiting for. Am I delusional? I'm so fixated on her that the prospect of succumbing to societal standards and ""putting a label"" on it is actually always at the forefront of my mind. I never really believed in this stuff. I feel like I'm going insane. But she really makes me consider it.

However it's not what she wants, and I respect that immensely. Pressuring her into a relationship is not an option. It's either, stick it out and see if things change-- maybe she likes me in the same way but wouldn't consider committing until later-- maybe I'll realize that this short term thing is what's best for me and my school/work life; or I tell her that if she doesn't want a relationship, then I would no longer like to see her. Because I'm now so anxious all the time about it and I could be digging into false hope that it could change. Maybe things would be better if I cut it off and tried again with someone else.

"Why do men always expect one thing? (Confused 20F) To start with, I‚Äôm friends with some guys and I also tried going on dates with people. One thing I‚Äôve noticed though is that they ALWAYS expect me to ""pay back for the date"" by having intercourse with them, even if it‚Äôs only the first date. They are way too obsessed with that as whenever I went on any dating apps they straight up offered intercourse to me (sometimes even offering to pay). I could never have a good conversation with anyone without getting hit with some nasty cheesy disrespectful flirty line. 
You might just go ahead and say ""but dating apps are MADE specifically for THAT"". However, dating apps and ""apps for meetups"" are different things. And logging into a dating app I have no idea that all I will get is harassment. 
Even if dating apps have been rethought by men, I can‚Äôt even feel safe around my male friends. Last time I visited my friend of 7 years at his house (because it was raining outside) he casually tried to rape me and then asked me what I expected coming to a man‚Äôs house.

And even when I completely gave up on dating and befriending men and just wanted to practice speaking foreign languages on Tandem, one dude asked me if I was a virgin right after asking me if I could help him practice English.

"[Repost] (30M) I've never been in a relationship, which also means I've never had a GF, and I've never been on a proper date. Am I doomed? I apologize in advance if this goes haywire, I don't know how to write what I want to write in proper fashion or if it's going to come out right. Having said that, here I go... So yeah, the title is the gist of what my love life is like. I blame no one but myself. I would say from the time of middle school up until the time the pandemic really started, no dates/kisses/relationships/sex, also it didn't help that (among other things) my teeth did not look good. And for the most part I was overweight. Before I started working for the first time at age 23, I was a nobody, just at home taking up space and not doing a whole lot of living. So how would I get my fix if you will if I couldn't have a gf or have sex? Porn. I know, smh. Heck, I would say I still struggle with porn and masturbation to this day. There was an improvement in my life around the time the pandemic started, I finished my Invisalign treatment after 1 1/2 years. But I found it ironic that I was ready to show off my new smile and then the mask mandate happened haha. But yeah, getting my teeth fixed was the most important thing that could have happened to me, it needed to happen. From there I think things improved slightly, at least I became a little bit more social, mainly with people from work. And then, the best thing that happened to me last year, I met my best friend (I'll call her Jennifer (not real name of course) at work. We got to know each other little by little, and to this day we are best friends. At some point, there were times (not many) where we were more than just friends, we kissed, cuddled, and of course had sex. Even with us doing that, we are, and will remain, best friends. The reason I bring that up is if it wasn't for her giving me those experiences than I would be here at 30 years old thinking to myself when is this this this and this going to happen. I could never repay her for what she did for me, she didn't have to do that, but she wanted to give me for the first time in my life a taste of what I want in my love life, when it comes to the physical stuff, the dating/relationship stuff is a whole other thing. Am I lost cause? Am I loser? Has the ship sailed for me? Is there a woman that would want me even when I improve myself? I would appreciate all the comments and questions that I can get. So ladies, and gents, what say you?

"I (22M) have been single my entire life and I'm just so tired of it I've only had two crushes in my life, an unrequited one when I was 17 and now this one with one of my best friends, which everything points is unrequited as well.

It's not like I have trouble putting myself out there, if anything this is the most socially active I've been in my life - while I wouldn't say I'm popular, but I'm pretty well liked with quite a few people saying I'm a passionate and funny person with tons of personality. Heck even my friend group consists of 10 members all of which I trust with my life. It's just that developing romantic feelings for said person is almost downright impossible for me, let alone being interested.

I know that made me sound like a complete self-centered jerk and I'm so sorry about that but I swear is what they've said about me.

Over the years I've worked on myself and, while I still stride for more, I'm happy with who I am - it's just that sometimes the dread of not being someone's special person is a bit too hard. I've never kissed or slept with anyone and it was just recently I held someone's hand.

I know that I must be patient and that forcing anything will only result in a terrible relationship which is the last thing I want to do, but you know there's just so much love, kindness and affection I've been yearning to share with a special someone and not being able to is emotionally exhausting sometimes.",ShrekTheOverlord,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eymt4/i_22m_have_been_single_my_entire_life_and_im_just/,1690854031.0,1.0

She read my message and never replied back. I wasn't trippin about it or anything because she probably will get back to me soon, no big deal.  
  
But a week past, and I noticed she never replied back at all. But I've noticed she watched all of my stories and such. So, I started getting all of these weird thoughts in my head. I was thinking, maybe sending her a message saying ""Hi, Lily"" with a smiley emoji came off too strong, or I came off too ""thirsty"" or I sounded like a ""creep"".  
  
I just took the hint that she doesn't want to talk to me. So, I unfollowed her, and I clicked the ""remove friend"" so she doesn't follow me back. I know it sounds petty. But I just took it as she wanted nothing to do with me. And nowadays, women will easily label the guy as a creep for trying to slide into her DMs. Men told me, if a woman doesn't reply to you at all, she doesn't like you, and that you should just take the hint and move on. Because women will always make time to get back to a guy that she likes.  
A few days has passed. And I woke up in the morning to a notification. It was Lily. She's requesting to be my friend on Instagram again. I'm very confused now. Why would she go out of her way to send me a follow request if she doesn't want to talk to me at all? I don't keep people as friends on Instagram if they won't want to reply back.

"I cry myself to sleep, heads over heels for this girl Updates on falling in love with a fellow intern...
The original post can be found in my profile, can't post links... For context I(25M) and the girl I'm having the feelings for is (22F).

As of yesterday, 31 July 2023, the intern that came in 5 weeks ago, that I have been having such intense feelings for had her final day at the organization.

 I got her a farewell gift pack consisting of a little card that stated my utmost thanks to her for the last 5 weeks, that she made me rediscover some things about myself and that our interactions have made me so happy and comfortable. I also gave a her little Teddy bear and some snacks. I asked to take a couple of photos with her, which we did. Afterwards, she drove me to the nearest train station which has been quite the going home routine over the past 2 weeks, and in the car I told her that I'm really, really thankful of her for the past 5 weeks, and that her being in my life at a low point in my life which was at the end of June and throughout July made me really grateful towards her.

 And I told her I really enjoyed our time together and our banter which she said she enjoyed the banter too. I then told her let's hang from time to time which she said she'll let me know. So at the very least it wasn't an outright ""no"", which I'm a little happy about.

Today, 1st August, at work, the sight of her empty desk and seat which is right across mine..and just remembering her coming into the roo, and lighting up the room and my life, the paths we walked in the workplace, her smile, her empty seat..ugh fuck I just broke down right there and them..that was about 15 minutes ago. I'm now writing this in the hope that it will do me good and a cry for help too? 

Like I'm really at such a low, low mental state. It's affecting me so terribly. I have her social media and her contact on a messaging app but she hasn't replied me.

why am i always the one to get broken up with? it must be something i‚Äôm doing if it‚Äôs happened multiple times but i feel like i‚Äôm a kind and understanding person. he told me i was his sweetest and kindest girlfriend and that he appreciated that i always listened to him and got along well with his friends. but it just feels like i‚Äôm doing something wrong, every time i get to the 2 month mark with someone, they end things with me. maybe i‚Äôm just not long term relationship material? :/ idk, i‚Äôve been trying to get over this for months, i just feel so unconfident in my personality and appearance. 

i‚Äôm working on losing weight right now but i feel like the main issue is my personality. i told him while we were together that i have a fear of being left and not feeling wanted, maybe it was a mistake to tell him that only a couple months into the relationship? i‚Äôm quite open about how i feel and what i think, not everyone likes that kind of quality. i unadded him on everything about a month ago to try to move on but i still constantly miss him and haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone new bc of how the breakup is effecting me. i just don‚Äôt know how to move on and feel good about myself again, any advice would be appreciated üòÖ",chubbylil,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eumjk/how_to_feel_confident_in_yourself_after_a_breakup/,1690843599.0,1.0

"Would you consider moving to somewhere with a better dating pool? My roommate (27M) and I (26M) rent a house in my hometown (a relatively small beach town in New England). The place is great for what we pay - large private fenced in yard, plenty of off-street parking, cool neighbors, literal 2 minute walk to the beach, etc. This was never really my plan; I graduated college at the height of covid and had to move home to take care of family, and I happened to find a job in town that has been great for my career over the past 2.5 years. I bought my dream truck and motorcycle, take vacations, max out a 401k, have equity in a promising startup, have hobbies, and I'm generally pretty happy. I promise I'm not bragging, but just trying to convey that things are going pretty good. 

The problem here is that this place is pretty remote, and due to rising costs it gets more difficult for people my age to live here every year. I know almost every person my age here, and I could probably count the (single) girls that I have any interest in on one hand. It's a minimum 30 minute drive to go to a bar where I might see new faces.

I've been considering moving somewhere where my hobbies are a little more popular to try to find more dates. This would include finding a new job closer to wherever I move. I'm very conflicted about moving - I'd be leaving behind a lot of family, friends, a great job, and a great living situation. 

What would you do in my shoes? I stay optimistic, but it really feels like I will never find love here. Am I overthinking this?

"Any help or advice appreciated. I recently broke it off with my ex girlfriend. We were on again off again for a while. I miss her so much but she was toxic and controlling. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to try and contact me again soon, if for no other reason than to laugh at me about my recent misfortunes in life. To be honest I hope she never reaches out to me again. 

The parts of her I love cannot be separated from her tendency to get angry and hostile towards me if I ever did something wrong. Instead of supporting me and communicating with me about her concerns her immediate reaction was always to punish (discard) me and devalue me.

My identity is eroded on and I sacrificed nearly 2 years of my life trying to make it work. I‚Äôm now faced with the inevitable reality of a broken heart and a path that has been disrupted. I understand that my experiences have been rather mild compared to someone going through divorce with kids for example.

"Should I try talking to someone I've tried to talk to in the past? There is a woman I tried texting/talking to while I was in high school, it was the first attempt I ever had at actively trying to talk. Well it crashed and burned lol, I can laugh about it now. 

A few years later, I started dating a girl that was in the first woman's network, it posed no issues or anything like that. We dated for 1.5 years, and broke up a few months ago (rough breakup), and I think I'm ready to move on. Given what I do for work, I'm limited in the time I have to go out and actively seek relationships (working off hours). 

Now that I am single again, and it's been a few years since I tried talking to the first woman, should I try texting or DMing her on Instagram? Or is it in my best interest not to?

Here are my concerns:
- she will tell my ex (which could backfire, since it was a rough breakup)
- facing a ""public"" rejection, where I'm ostracized by the whole friend network (I don't mind getting rejected, just not embarrassed, that sucks)

If I were to DM, what should I say? I've obviously changed since high school, and she still may not be interested, which is alright. Or should I just leave it and not DM?

How do you find people who are understanding? I (26m) have recently identified with the help of my therapist that the kind of person I would be looking to date is probably going to need to be someone who is understanding/compassionate. The reason for this is I‚Äôm a often a misunderstood person who is passed off because of my parents success or because of other reasons. What I‚Äôm trying to understand is what are some qualities or some indicators that someone is understanding or compassionate when it comes to dating. One of the ideas I had is that maybe someone‚Äôs job can suggest that they might be a more understanding person but it‚Äôs also entirely possible that is not true as well. I‚Äôm leaning towards thinking that some teachers might be more understanding types. If this is the case what sort of jobs and or hobbies would someone who is understanding do? Also what are some of the qualities that might stand out in someone who is understanding?

"Should I tell her that I have feelings for her? I‚Äôve lived with my roommate for 3 years. she‚Äôs about the same age of me or a bit younger. I‚Äôve had feelings for her for a while but I respected the fact that we live together and didn‚Äôt pursue it further.

We do and did hangout from time to time at some point our bond became really strong and we were hanging out a lot but then it turns awkward and she ends up going back to her room.

I used to hit on her and lightly touch her and she didn‚Äôt mind.

I‚Äôm a confident guy for the most part but for some reason I can‚Äôt seem to tell her which is weird.

What completely sucks is I saw some girl a week or two weeks ago and suddenly after we‚Äôve hangout and had sex and fun I suddenly started crying and poor girl I caught her off guard she didn‚Äôt know what to do!

She‚Äôs travelling for a year now and she said she‚Äôll come back but who knows what will happen tomorrow ever since she told me I‚Äôm extremely sad and depressed and tried to ask her to hangout a couple times but she‚Äôs been acting busy and forgetful.

Does that mean that I shouldn‚Äôt tell her since she doesn‚Äôt want to hangout? 

Should I go all the way in or she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a creep and awkward

"IMO being emotionally mature and open is actually a detriment to dating now I'm someone who is now (wasn't always for sure) very comfortable with themselves and I do not mind being open and honest with people. 

I understand the whole oversharing and being too intense at first meet can be a huge problem, but this is not what i'm talking about. 

I mean like weeks into dating, being open about what your expectations are with someone, sharing that you really care about them and being open about your feelings. Again, this is like 5th-10th date i'm talking about.

90% of the time I get completely ghosted after. 

It's really my opinion that if you are emotionally mature and open and honest, you are in the minority of people these days in the dating scene, and doing such makes people who are not extremely uncomfortable, lesser than you, and brings up emotions they don't want to deal with.

"My ex-girlfriend wants to have sex with me I‚Äôve somewhat been caught off-balance by a recent inquiry from my ex-girlfriend. We both are HSV1 positive and first met on a herpes dating website. Our shared experience brought us together and blossomed into a meaningful relationship. It was comforting and liberating to be with someone who understood precisely what I was going through.

However, as destiny would have it, our emotional pathways diverged, and we decided to go our separate ways. It was a mutual decision founded on understanding for the betterment of our individual lives. Post-breakup, we gave each other time and space to heal and move on.

Recently, my ex connected back with a proposition: to continue having sexual relations. That was unexpected, and it has left me quite confused.

Physically, we are still attracted to each other. Since we both are HSV1 positive, there‚Äôs no potential threat of transmission between us. However, I‚Äôm genuinely concerned about reentering such an intimate relationship with my ex, given our history and the emotional complexity it might entail.

Our shared HSV1 condition brings a level of comfort no doubt, especially when managing flare-ups and understanding the stigma. But, at the same time, I‚Äôm apprehensive that revisiting the sexual aspect of our relationship might reopen old wounds. I worry it could hinder my emotional progress and independence after our breakup.

Consequently, I am struggling with how to navigate this delicate situation. How should I handle this proposition? Is it advisable to maintain a sexual relationship with an ex, given that we share the same condition? If anybody experienced something similar, how did you handle it, and what was the impact on your emotional and mental health?

I told her I enjoy being more dominating in bed and she says that im just saying that to get her aroused.

This leads to us having rough sex and I finished in her hair which she was not okay with.

Afterwards we had dinner and I paid, we walked around for a bit and she decides to stay over at a friend's because she said she wants to hang out with her pet. I told her that's fine and decided to walk her there since it's about a mile away in a rough part of town.

She called me the next day and said that what happened last night was not okay and I came on way too strong, I told her I'm sorry but that's what she said she was into. She admitted she did talk a big talk but I was being selfish but she didn't like being degraded and vulnerable like that.

Against?

Don't care either way?

Why?

Personally, I never have anything to hide so I'd feel indifferent.

I've been in relationships with open phone policies in the past (without actually calling it that) since it was just more convenient to use whoever's phone was closest at the time if we needed to look something up.

However, if we were married, it would have to be required.  My reason is that if we have both names on the shared title of homes, names on the shared titles of cars, names on the shared credit cards, names on shared investment accounts, and sharing joint bank accounts, then sharing phones is SERIOUSLY the LOWEST on the totem pole of those things already being shared.",johnwayne2413,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ewebu/how_do_you_feel_about_open_phone_policies_when/,1690848050.0,1.0

"Celebrity Crushes So there's this girl that i've talking too for almost two years. We're in the stage where we act like we're together but neither one of us wants to admit it.

Everything is fine, but when she starts mentioning all these celebrity crushes and fantasies is when it makes me think differently. She always send me tiktok's and video about drake, 21 savage, justin bieber, all the above. Or just other guys on Tiktok. And she always says ""my man my man"". 

In my previous relationship, one of the reasons my ex didn't like me is because i didn't have dreads like a certain rapper. It doesn't hurt my feelings as much as it did before, but when this new girl sends me all these guys, it makes me feel like i'm not enough, or never gonna be enough. Almost like a PTSD moment.

"What's the Psychology Behind Slow Texting? I don't understand slow texters at all. Either I want to talk to someone instantly, or I  don'tvwant to talk to them at all; so when I get a text, I immediately read it and respond, usually within a couple of minutes of it being sent--sometimes only seconds. I'll then carry through the conversation to a natural stopping point. Or, if it's a text I don't want to answer, I'll block that person.

This is my procedure with friends, partners, and even mere acquaintances. I do this even though I'm a fairly busy person with responsibilities, and I don't find it at all difficult to respond promptly to everyone. Texting an eloquent and fitting response is not hard if you have any readiness with language. It takes mere seconds.

Compare this with a young woman I've been seeing. She'll text asking me how my day is on Thursday. I'll respond within a minute or two, and she won't text back (or even read my message) till Sunday afternoon. This is something she does repeatedly. It's fine for her to not want to talk, but why text me at all if you aren't interested in my response? 

Can anyone explain the thinking behind this kind of texting behavior? I can't even begin to wrap my mind around it. ",Snoo-93317,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15evjij/whats_the_psychology_behind_slow_texting/,1690845910.0,0.5

"My boyfriend was abused by his ex-girlfriend for over a year My (23F) boyfriend (24M) dated this girl he went to high school with for at least a year. He told me that she would throw things at him, punch him, charge at him, etc. There was emotional/verbal abuse involved too‚Äînot just physical. Sometimes it got to be so bad that he had to sneak out of his ex-girlfriend‚Äôs house and run away.

When we first started dating, he would flinch a lot (which I totally get, especially since he was abused) whenever I would go to kiss his cheek or touch his face. Sometimes, I would unconsciously throw things to him instead of handing them to him (ex. if he wanted a roll of paper towels, I‚Äôd toss them and he‚Äôd shield himself‚Äîyes, I was stupidly inconsiderateü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I felt bad). Randomly hugging him from behind would startle him at times too. I would feel so bad when he would get startled, because I know he has PTSD from his previous relationship, even though I never would hurt him. 

Recently, after 6 months, I‚Äôve been noticing he never flinches anymore.

He assumed it‚Äôd be like that but I stuck around and he really likes me. He used to live local but moved away for work, about 12 hours away. We are both apprehensive about getting into a relationship since ours was messy and hurt. Before he left we were getting really close and I helped him pack and it was really emotional, he said saying goodbye to me was very hard for him. He is depressed where he lives now and I have see an obvious decline in his personality. I visited him this weekend and asked him if he was losing feelings. Convos seem mundane and I feel like a distraction. I asked him this and he responds; ‚ÄúI see my friends going through life and I‚Äôm here. I see people living their lives and I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt do anything, I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on life. You aren‚Äôt a distraction, well kind of, not in the bad way you think. You pull me out of this and keep me grounded.

He keeps saying if we date blah blah blah, like romanticizing the idea, like after we had that talk. I‚Äôm so confused.

"I've been ghosted by the first girl that i have actually loved I recently got ghosted by someone I thought was important to me. We had a fight while she was in Mexico on an internship (just during the summer break, she'll be back in a week), so everything was through text. We go to the same university, and the summer break is almost over, so she'll be back soon. I'm afraid to meet her by coincidence at university because she hasn't responded to my messages, even though I've tried to talk to her and resolve things. I opened up to her about a lot of things, and it was the first time I felt in love with someone.  
  
She was the first girl I ever introduced to my family, and I had never felt this way for someone before. I was aware that I was giving more than I was receiving, but she was open with me too. She told me things that she doesn't share with other people, like her traumas and family problems. I can't help but care about her.  
  
Before she went to Mexico, she talked to me about how she felt like she couldn't be a good partner for anyone. Of course, I was honest and told her that I was willing to make things work with her, and that we would figure it out. She made me happier than I already was.  
  
But at that moment, something changed. I felt like she was looking for an excuse to be distant or to just walk away. She was inconsistent with her behaviour, sometimes praising me and other times finding something wrong with everything I did.  
  
She went to Mexico, and she was really busy and barely even texted, let alone talked. I told her that I thought it would be best for both of us to focus on ourselves while we were apart, and she got mad and told me that I was confusing her and she was tired of the same old thing. (I felt like this was just an excuse.)  
  
She hasn't responded to my texts, but she hasn't blocked me on social media either. She watches my stories, and she even liked a picture I posted on my stories a while ago.  
  
Since that day, she hasn't talked to me. The summer break is almost over, and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid and anxious. The last time I saw her in person, we had an amazing date. Now look at us.

"Girl I was messaging stopped replying Long and short of it: I (22m) matched with a girl (22f) on tinder. She liked me first, and her interests, location and listed personality traits all matched mine. I sent the first message, asked an open ended question about one of her hobbies/pictures, and she responded in kind. We sent 3 or so more messages, and every time I sent one she liked it (the little heart react tinder has).

But then after that (two to three days, 1-2 texts a day) she stopped responding.

I felt like we were hitting it off great, and one of my feminine friends saw my texts, she agreed that none of what I sent sounded weird or upsetting.

I'm not even really sure what advice I'm asking for here, this is half venting half wondering what I did/ should do.

"Taking a break from talking to a guy I really like &amp; really likes me while I figure out what I want I (24F) went on a first date with a guy who's just shy of 10 years older than me 1 week before leaving the city I live in and I told him about me leaving the city we live in for a few months to get some health treatments. 

We had made plans to see each other the day before my flight, but he sent me a text message the afternoon before our plans saying that he really liked me and is attracted to me, but was not ready for something serious, especially at long distance. He said that he still wanted to keep in touch and get to know me. At the time, I was like ""I don't even have the bandwidth for a serious relationship"" and we talked things out and decided to continue chatting.

We have stayed in decent communication (mainly via text &amp; voice notes, plus 2 phone calls) while he was on vacation and I have been recovering from surgery. I've been talking to him for about 2 months. 

Last week, we had some conversations that felt emotionally really intimate and I freaked out and felt like all of a sudden I actually DO want a serious relationship. (The thing is I do--but still so far down the line that I can't even see that happening in the next 6 months for me, I just didn't know it at the time when I was trying to tell him this). 

I sent him a message saying that my feelings had changed and that it turns out I actually did want something serious. Long story short, we decided to part ways amicably because I was not interested in being friends with him. 

However, I've been reflecting on my decision for the past few days, and I think that it's a good idea I stopped talking to him, but mainly because things were moving too quickly for me over text and I was afraid of falling for the idea of this person I was creating in my head (because of the distance, and also because i have more time on my hands to let my imagination run wild), so I cut it out. I find that I really miss him and I still want to see him when I move back to our city in about a month, and I am trying my hardest not to text him again and be like ""lol sike!"" 

I've realized that I actually don't know what dating is and what getting to know someone looks like, because my only serious long term relationship started after a 4 year friendship with a guy, so we became officially pretty quickly. I'm also realizing that I may be more impatient than I ever knew, because when I look at the situation as if one of my friends was telling me about it, I would be like you need to chill tf out you still don't know this guy. I'm hoping that I haven't ruined my chances of getting to know him by getting in my own way afls;djfaskld. 

I have 2 questions: 

1) in this interim time out I've put myself in, how can I really hone in on determining what I want? I find that the extra time I have on my hands is clouding my judgement making, and because I'm essentially in solitary confinement, I am feeling lonelier than usual. I will be resuming physical activity soon and slowly getting my life back together, so I'm hoping that helps. 

2) How should I approach seeing him again when I'm ready? Should I say I've been thinking about him or just ask him for a casual coffee and see how it goes from there?

"Is It Creepy To Ask A Girl To Reject Me? Reposting from another subreddit. 

*For context: I'm not good with women I find attractive. Most of the time I assume they're creeped out by me. I also don't know where to stop with girls so I just never start to begin with. It sucks.*

*Also, I exaggerate for humor. It may seem like I'm extremely attached to this girl and utterly heartbroken, but this is not true. I am only utterly heartbroken.*

I (24, M) met a girl (no idea, F) via an out-of-state program.  We didn't talk much, mostly because I'm terrible with women I find attractive, but I got a sense that she liked me back. I won't go into the post-mortem here. It was a new feeling for me. I immediately assumed I must be hallucinating the signs of attraction. I kept going back and forth until the very end, mostly because the signs kept getting more pronounced, but nothing significant came out of it. We talked twice one-on-one and several times in group settings.

**For those of you in a similar situation right now:** I'm still kicking myself for not talking to her during the myriad other chances I had. Go talk to whoever it is you like. Ask them out. Don't be like me.

Anyways, I realized at the very end of the program that she wasn't utterly creeped out by me, so I messaged her on an app (whose name I will redact for fear of ridicule) (it's popular and used for work-related stuff). She seemed to be okay with me. The conversation quickly died off, so I left things and assumed I'd been rejected. That was fine by me. I stuffed myself with tamales and moped in private.

Four days later, I was informed that it was *my* fault.

Apparently, I text like a sentient slice of white bread. It's incredibly difficult to continue conversations because my messages feel AI generated. This was a revelation to me, because I'd assumed that she didn't want to talk to me at all. Turns out that wasn't necessarily true. There's a chance I'd misinterpreted the whole thing again.

So I did what any logical person would do. I prepped a message asking for her number, edited it thrice, asked a beta reader to proof-read it, edited it again, scrapped it, wrote something else, downed a few beers, and sent the new message to her at around midnight.

Checked my DMs the next morning. No response. Rejection. Cue sad songs and staring out of car windows longingly.

To reiterate, I'm not obsessed, just melodramatic. It didn't help that I thought she liked me back. I won't lie: I mulled over a lot of our interactions to see if I'd misinterpreted her behavior. It just didn't make sense to me. Still doesn't. Anyways, cut to a few days later, and I delete the app because it has no use for me anymore.

Which is when something occurred to me. *What if she'd done the same thing?*

It is unlikely, but entirely feasible, that she also deleted it because she had no use for it. Our conversation ended three days prior and I hadn't seen her online since then. The first time I texted her, I had confirmation that she was still on it. It was a 'now or never' moment for me. I wasn't stuck to the app all day to find out but she seemed to be on it frequently.

Not this time. As far as I can tell, I hadn't seen her online in days, before or after my message.

(Again -- I would like to emphasize this -- I haven't been checking every hour. I have a life outside pining for this girl. That also means I don't know for sure if my theory is correct.)

There's also no 'seen' notifications on this app.

Now the uncertainty is killing me. Did she ghost me? Did she even see my eloquent little 'u up'? I don't know. I feel like the safest way to find out would be to text her, something to the effect of 'hey, did you even see this? \[app\] doesn't tell me and I'M DYING TO KNOW', but I think that might be too creepy to do. The lack of an answer is tearing me apart. I'd be ~~relatively~~ okay with a rejection at this point, as long as I knew that's exactly what it was.

I'm lost. I don't want to be the guy that double texts after being ghosted and creeps people out. I'll be more of a laughing stock than I already am. On the other hand, I don't want her to see my message a year after everything went down. I want her to know I like her now, and I want to know her answer now. I don't mind on this 1-in-100 edge case.

So, once again, I need your help. Nothing makes sense. I'm driving myself crazy. Someone please tell me what I should (or should not) be doing in this situation. This is my first time expressing interest in a girl too, at least explicitly, so I'm not equipped to deal with this at all.

"Why do ppl do this/How can I handle this gracefully? Why are some ppl like this? Also how tf do I handle things gracefully.

I attended a martial arts training camp about a month ago. It was a big one with ppl flying in from across the country and international too. Met lots of ppl there including one girl from BC who seemed very friendly. She first asked for my number just to help give rides to her friends who needed transportation to and from the venue. But then started texting random questions (shit you can easily google), added me on my socials, randomly messaged me on them.

She knows I'm in a relationship already with someone else (it's literally on my fb page and my profile pic is if me and my gf). I made no secret of my gf when she added me on my socials. Said to her face ""that's my gf."" But she keeps messaging me on my socials. Shit like ""hey u up?"" Or liking and commenting on my insta stories. I just leave her on read or respond with one or two word answers only if I do reply at all. Could be she's just friendly - I hope that's what it is - but it just feels weird. I don't wanna be rude but also don't want her comin' at me since I love my gf and want to keep the relationship safe. How can I shut her down in a kind way?

Also, if she is trying to flirt, I just wanna know: What are people like this thinking? Do they really think they can successfully steal you? And if they do, do they really think you'll be loyal to them?

Me (26F) was single the last 6 years. I come from an abusive household and abusive relationships. I isolated myself and now I am trying to date again because I feel like I deserve to feel love, give love and be loved.

Now, as soon as I meet a guy, I get emotionally extremely attached. All the lightheartedness I had at first vanishes and what‚Äôs left is a jealous and possessive woman who just wants to spend 24/7 of her time with their partner.

"I messed up, I saved my crush's other number secretly and now he's found out, I don't know what to do. Okay so, please don't judge but I've messed up a little bit and I know I sound like a red flag.  
I've been talking to this guy for the last 2 months, we hit it off, we exchanged numbers and we started talking and calling on whatsapp. That's cool. It's normal. So now I started developing a crush on this guy and you know when that happens you start searching them up. So I did just that. His socials are public so I could see every post, every like. Everything. I did a happy dance because now I could get to know him a bit better. We don't have each other on socials, we just have each others numbers so this was exciting.  
Anyway, so now as I'm scrolling through facebook, I see that he's made a post on a group we both had in common a few months ago and he posted his phone number there, a different one. So I did the thing that only intellectuals would do. I saved that number in my phone. I don't know what I was thinking. I just did it thinking if he ever pulled a prank on me from his other number now I'd know. That number was also active on whatsapp.  
Fast forward to today, I posted a status on my stories on whatsapp not knowing what the future held for me..A few hours later, a text comes through, I check my phone absolutely puzzled, turns out its from his number that I saved secretly. It said 'Why is your status showing up on this number of mine?' I saw his message and now I'm numb.   
I'm so scared. I know I did the wrong thing. Even though his post on facebook was public and anyone could contact him from there I still feel like it was an invasion of someones privacy as it was a bit of a personal post that he had made and I broke those rules. Now I'm too scared to admit what I actually did.  
Is there something else I can come up with that would seem legible? I don't want him to know I was stalking him as we hadn't talked since 5 days. He hadn't replied back to my text which is fine but now he's going to think it was all connected! I'm so worried. I don't know what to do.

Recently, he's been getting really bad, to the point where I was concerned he was going to harm himself. I know he's had mental health issues in the past and has gone to therapy, which seemed to help, but this move has been super hard on him.

"Why are so many men embracing toxic dating advice? There was a dating advice website dedicated to men, and one of it's articles had the following advice:

""*When looking for a life partner, my advice to men is date all of them: the bad girls, the cool girls, the commitment-phobic girls, the crazy girls. But do not marry them. The things that make the bad girls sexy do not make them good wives. When it comes time to settle down, find someone who wants an equal partner. Someone who thinks men should be smart, opinionated and ambitious. Someone who values fairness and expects or, even better, wants to do her share in the home. These women exist and, trust me, over time, nothing is sexier.*""

"Different approaches by men and women on dating sites? (Not generalizing) New to this group so trying to keep the rules in mind.

As a prefix here, I want to be clear I am NOT generalizing, just relating my honest observations. 

I have used eharmony on and off since July 2021. I went to this site as it struck me in being one of the more reputable and 'serious' sites. I am a straight 37 year old man. 

My experience has been very mixed. I had some painful encounters but also met sincere matches, some of whom I mutually agreed to remain friends as we respected one another. This post will not be about all those experiences or all the ins and outs of online dating.

I want to be a bit more specific in one 'trend' I have noticed. 

I think it is fair to say that with online dating, much like physical dating, the man is expected to make the first move. I can honestly say about 95% of the conversations I have had with matches had been initiated by me and speaking to other men, they concur they initiated contact.

Inevitably, this means that male members need to have a certain level of persistence and effort, otherwise they are likely to have no communication at all. I am not talking about persistence with individuals (actually eharmony has a 5 post limit - ie send her a message, smiley face, like her intro etc) but rather the approach that is required to get any attention at all.

To give an idea of this persistence, I might message say, 8 matches I am interested in over a few weeks. Of those 8, I MIGHT get one response. I think only by communicating can you know if you are compatible with someone. 

Even when I do get a response, there is no guarantee of a follow up and I find some members find it easier to lie than be upfront and say they are not interested. 

Now before people get the wrong idea here, I am always polite, never sleazy and sincere in my desire to find the right match. I am average looking but I feel I 'sell' myself on my profile and I am open enough to show there are no obvious red flags. 

I know the problem isn't with my approach because of those matches I have spoke to the communication has largely been respectful and positive. In some cases she ultimately rejected me or I rejected her because we decided we were not compatible enough or there were external factors (different life plans, feelings for an ex etc) My point is I am not writing as some sort of insecure guy who lacks confidence or skill with women. 

I have had good relationships before and plenty of female friends. 

So why is the ratio of messages received/responses given the way it is? 

I used to think some members were basically rude - and to some extent I still believe that is the case. To me, if someone spent time composing a thoughtful message I would show them the basic respect of replying even if I wasn't really attracted to them. I literally came across one match who was asking guys to show they were sincere by writing a long message - then she couldn't be bothered to respond. 

When I have asked women about this, the responses are usually as follows: 

\- they had got hurt and felt foolish by making the first move and then getting rejected. 

\- Due to experience of sexual harassment they mistrusted the intentions of guys on dating sites. 

So let's consider these two points -

\- No one likes to be rejected but men get hurt too yet still have no choice but to continue making the first move

\- To be fair, this probably is something female members experience much more and I can understand if a woman is getting constant sleazy messages, she would become cynical and feel that is all male members are interested in. But this also in my view depends on the specific site. Some simply have a better quality of members than others. And of course there are plenty of men who are sincere in their search and not just looking for sex. 

I have also considered practical factors. Ultimately dating sites are businesses and in order to make a profit they rely on paid memberships. It may well be that a lot of members sign up to these sites then realize they cannot respond to messages. Or in some cases it really is an issue of time commitment - some people go in half-heartedly and/or simply get to busy to follow up. I think this is understandable - however I still think there should be a basic sense of consideration for others and that is something that people don't take accountability for. I am not talking about rejection. Any female or male member has a right to reject someone if they are not interested but there is no excuse to mislead someone or waste their time. 

Anyway, i'll round this up.

Some people may falsely interpret this as a rant about women on dating sites. It really isn't. I am well aware that people are individuals and for every entitled person who doesn't consider others there is another considerate person who does.

I think men and women both face pressures but in different ways. Broadly speaking (again I am not generalizing or saying one size fits all) Men do have to make more effort in that initial contact and experience message after message being ignored or not followed up. 

But women may well experience issues that we men cannot see. Maybe the aforementioned sleaziness is higher than one might think. After all, I can't see directly how other guys are communicating. Maybe pressure to 'not hurt his feelings' by telling him the truth. Personally I would rather have a polite rejection than ignored and I have experienced both. For me a polite rejection just means it is not meant to be with that person whereas being ignored really saps energy and makes you wonder - what is the point of trying? 

I have posted this in the spirit of being candid about my own experience and for something to think about. It is in no way intended to incite a 'battle of the sexes' but rather, hopefully help people to be more considerate in their approach to online dating. Maybe you are a woman and thinking 'but guys do that to!' and I would not argue. Online dating is damn difficult and takes enormous patience but I think people who are sincere and serious can all help to create a better experience.

Do members agree with my take? Maybe you have experienced something different? Maybe women here can follow up on some of the points i've raised for instance. But I do feel that whilst online dating can be trying for anyone, there are basic approaches that differ. In no way do I claim to speak for all men and I am absolutely aware people are individuals, I just think that men and women do think in different ways about some of this. 

Finally, I would appreciate no snarky responses ie 'this guy is just bitter etc' - my intention here is for mature discussion in the spirit I have written this. 

Actually at the time of writing, I am getting particularly close to one lady and whilst practical circumstances may keep us apart (she has a pre-planned work contract abroad and we are still awaiting the outcome of her exam) - so I am writing more in retrospect and to be informative and thought-provoking.

"Cultural Differences in Dating: Need Advice from U.S. Locals Hi everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl from Europe who recently came to the U.S. as an au pair. It's been a really exciting journey so far, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how boys here interact compared to back home.  
In my home country, it seems like boys are quite direct and straightforward when they're interested in someone. However, here in the U.S., I've noticed that their approach can be quite different, sometimes more nuanced or indirect.  
I find it somewhat challenging to interpret their actions and intentions. Are they just being friendly or are they interested in something more? I don't want to misinterpret any signals or make any assumptions that could lead to awkward situations.  
I guess what I'm asking is: could anyone give me some insights or advice on how to navigate these cultural differences? What signs should I look out for that might indicate a boy is interested in more than just friendship? I'd really appreciate any input, especially from those who have grown up here and understand the dating culture better.

"How do I become a real person? So I realized after looking at all these profiles over years and years, and reading all these posts about what to do, what not to do.

"I want to date again but I still feel hurt from my ex. So I dumped my ex like a year and three months ago. We've been together for 7 years and dated for 2.

Eventually I left her for being too disrespectful and insulting towards me. Essentially she was using me to vent and always had anger attacks that needed therapy.

Of course, she met and bragged about her new guy 2 weeks after the fact. And looking back on it. She reached out to me after an abusive ex dumper a couple of weeks prior. So I was a rebound that became long term and worked for the most part.

It's been a long time since all that mess. I waited with hopes for her to return for eleven months and just stopped waiting for her like a month ago.

Nevertheless, I know I'm not ready to date again just yet. 

The pain I feel is more so the realization of what type of person she really is. And I feel... Dissapointed by who she turned out to be and by how much I loved her.

I did have a rebound like 2 months after we broke up but It was only for like a week and that girl is now my best friend.

I am of the belief that love is not looked for. It's found. Love comes to you. So I won't go on dating apps or anything. Neither would I try to utilize a new relationship to replace my pain. (Like my ex did.) I just don't know if It's ok to date if my wounds are of dissapointment. I know I will continue to lament the bad ending of this chapter until I start the new chapter. But am I ok? I don't want to bore my new partner with my ex. But at the same time, It's a wound I'd like to share. It really has done a number in me.

I want to be fair. To be a healthy boyfriend who gives his all and have a girl that offers the same. To carry each other when one is down and to walk this life together. To laugh and sacrifice.

I know I'm not ready, quite yet. But it's been plenty of time. And I do not know if this level of wound is acceptable for a new beggining. What can you tell me?",Joseph18Gamer,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15er3u3/i_want_to_date_again_but_i_still_feel_hurt_from/,1690835317.0,1.0
"First date was a disaster So I (29) went on a first date Friday night with a man (31) that I‚Äôve been talking to for a little over 2 months. We met through mutuals, he added me on IG and it kinda just went from there. There was no actual intent on dating the first month of chatting‚Äîthere was friendship and it naturally grew into more. We texted everyday and FT. We didn‚Äôt meet up as quickly because he lives 2hrs away and he had lagged on the 3 previous attempts to hang out‚Ä¶ (yes I know how that looks) it was always bs excuses (I‚Äôm sick, my eye is red, I‚Äôm scared to meet you because I‚Äôm not social) but somehow I was dumb enough to look past it. I knew he was extremely shy. 

He finally made plans to visit me on his day off and decided to book a room suggesting we have dinner and meet for breakfast the next morning‚Ä¶but red flags were starting to appear before he even got to my city for example when I asked for his eta so I can ‚Äúget ready‚Äù he replied with a snarky ‚Äúwhy would you need to get ready? I told you I always look like a bum. Don‚Äôt dress too nicely it‚Äôll just make me feel awkward.‚Äù I thought it was weird but I decided to reassure him (like I always had to do) despite the uneasiness knowing he had self esteem issues due the constant self deprecating remarks he made about himself to me.

So he makes it to the hotel, tells me he doesn‚Äôt want to pick me up because he‚Äôs driving an old car and that he needed to ‚Äúreset before meeting me.‚Äù So I was like sure that‚Äôs fine. I thought maybe he just wanted to lay down for a bit or something.

He tells me when to head out. I got to the restaurant approximately 5-8 minutes after him, greeted him warmly and I all got was a cold ‚Äúdid you see what I texted you? It‚Äôs a 40 minute wait.‚Äù I said ‚Äúoh ok should we go walk?‚Äù (We were in a market place setting) Meanwhile he‚Äôs sulking and obviously annoyed he gets up ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù then I suggest we sit at an empty table so we could comfortably talk and he got even more irritated. We sit down, he tells me ‚Äúthis is annoying why would you pick this place knowing I don‚Äôt like crowds I feel like you did this maliciously and on purpose to take shots at me‚Äù he told me in a previous conversation that he doesn‚Äôt like crowds but in no way did I think to this extent‚Ä¶ I was in shock! I again tried to reassure him that I would never do such a thing, even asking him if he wanted to go somewhere else. He declined ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point I already put my name down‚Äù 

He gets the ‚Äútable is ready‚Äù text so we get seated and while we‚Äôre looking at the menu I mention I might just get something small BUT HE EVEN GOT ANNOYED AT THAT. ‚ÄúWhy would you pick this place knowing you were just going to get an appetizer. It‚Äôs awkward that I‚Äôm going to be eating and you‚Äôre not.‚Äù Uhhh??? at this point getting up and walking out was running through my head. He ordered hot sake shots, took the first one without me lol. Told me to taste his cocktail so I took 2 sips and he said ‚Äúmight as well keep it, since you‚Äôre drinking it all.‚Äù 

Fast forward to the end of the night‚Ä¶. He pays the bill and we walk outside. He offers to walk me to my car &amp; asks me ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd you park at?‚Äù  I tell him I parked behind the theater. He replies ‚Äúlike I know where the hell that‚Äôs at‚Äù 
Not even half way there I stop him and we exchange a few words gave him a side hug and dipped. When I got home I texted ‚Äúthanks for dinner‚Äù he instantly responded ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome. I‚Äôm sorry for taking your time.‚Äù GUYS WTF   I‚Äôve never been treated this way and was in absolute disbelief.

After that text I blocked him on everything.",Samdgreat,770,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dg6t5/first_date_was_a_disaster/,1690705232.0,0.96

"Advice on recent dating situation - uncertain about interest Hi everyone, I could use some advice on a dating situation that has me feeling a bit confused. I've been seeing this guy for almost a month now, and things seemed to be going well. We've been texting every day and meeting up every weekend. 

Last weekend, we had a fun double date with some friends, and everything seemed great. However, on Sunday, things got a bit weird.

He seemed a bit distant when I arrived on Saturday, but he blamed it on being tired from a late night out. The double date went well, or so I thought, but on Sunday, he suddenly had to meet a friend for a last-minute thing. He mentioned he thought he told me about it the night before, but I don't recall that conversation. After spending the night together, he texted me later in the day, and our texts have become quite cold. 

I'm torn between ignoring his last message to save face as he has suddenly gone cold and risk looking too keen if I bring up my concerns. I feel like he should know why I'm a bit bothered and notice my change in texts.

"Boyfriend wants me to stop stripping When I met my boyfriend he knew that I was working at a stripclub making very good money about two months into us dating . Now the economy has slowed down and I am not making as much but I‚Äôm sure it will eventually pick up again. I am 34 years old and still making more money than the average person in America . My plan was to quit when I could no longer make money stripping and once I found a stable alternative career. I am starting a small business and it‚Äôs in its infancy so it‚Äôs not 100 percent reliable to fall back on. I have never had an issue finding long term relationships and women working in my job are often married with families. Their husbands understand it‚Äôs just a job and men can look at  them but they can‚Äôt touch them. It is like being an actress . Their husbands don‚Äôt like it but I guess they tolerate it as there is a lot of pros ( the women make good money and able to have savings when most people these days can‚Äôt afford even an emergency fund, they only have to work a few days a week, and can retire early if they make proper investments). 

However now my boyfriend is telling me that he doesn‚Äôt want to get married unless I stop stripping. He has not proposed to me. I think it‚Äôs fair that I tell him that unless I have a proposal I am not going to give up my source of income especially since the guy I‚Äôm dating is not making enough to provide solely on his income alone. He has a good pension but his income is not great. I have bills to pay and have some health issues with medical expenses . I think this is a fair compromise . Either that or I tell him that I‚Äôm going to continue stripping and he can leave the relationship if he wants to, as I was doing this when we met and I actually find it offensive that he thinks he can ask me to change my job now at this time. He says that my job is not good for my mental health . And I totally agree, a lot of the men have to be asked to leave for saying inappropriate things or trying to touch the dancers. However, there are a lot of jobs where people don‚Äôt feel great about what they do for a living and they keep going because they have bills to pay . I am also preparing to make an exit but not until I am financially secure with another job or business . Is what I am asking a fair compromise , or should I just move on ?

"Dating while trying to lose weight, clinically depressed, and tired. There's two lines of thought when it comes to dating and being happy. One is that you need to be happy with yourself before dating as it's not the responsibility of the other person to make you happy. This paints your partner as more of a supplement to your already great life. The other comes from Plato who insists we're not whole until we find our soulmate.

&gt;*Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature. Each of us, then, is a ‚Äòmatching half‚Äô of a human whole‚Ä¶and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him.*

With that being said, I'm not happy. I'm overweight, clinically depressed, tired, and unmotivated. Appealing to the opposite sex? Absolutely not, but luckily for me, I don't open with that on dating apps. I wonder, is there truth to Plato's idea of love? I would think so as finding someone to do things with would alleviate the depression and cooking with each other would stop all the takeout. There'd also be someone there to hold you accountable for your actions.

Anyone experience it firsthand? Has your partner made you a better person or were you already a good person beforehand?

P.S. I'm in treatment for my issues.

"I just want to be someone's priority... Hey hey! I've recently been thinking a lot about *why* I want to be in a relationship because I've always felt a sort of desperation behind it. I finally came to the conclusion that it's pretty much solely because I want to be prioritized.

I'm extremely extroverted and thus have a huge network of friends, many who I consider myself very close to. 90% of the time, I feel great and like I don't even need to date because I can always ask one of my friends to do fun date-like activities that I'd do with a bf/gf. Honestly, many of my friends *feel* like a significant other to me (minus like...sex lol) so it's great to have them around. But it's the rare times when I ask one of these close friends to make plans and they turn me down in order to do something with *their* significant other that send me straight to sad land. 

Like, I totally get it and they obviously should prioritize their partner, but it's just like damn...I'll always be #2 to everyone if I'm single. There's no one I can 100% outright rely on to be there for me. That thought makes me sad, then I get anxious, then I start frantically dating.

"I (24M) am overthinking gf‚Äôs (24F) relationship with make best friend Hey y‚Äôall! My (24M) girlfriend (24F) is great. Never given me a reason to not trust her. She truly loves me and I love her. 

But she has a coworker male best friend - that in all honesty, he‚Äôs great. He‚Äôs awesome. Based on our few interactions, he‚Äôs a genuine guy. And I‚Äôm jealous of him. 

He can make my partner laugh in ways I‚Äôve never seen. They‚Äôre constantly smiling at each other. Any time he talking, she‚Äôll perk up and listen to his every word. L She‚Äôll compliment him in ways she complimented me in the past. (I was really happy when she told me she was attracted to how wise I am. But then also called him wise at a different time. I know, I‚Äôm being dramatic but it bothered me for some reason). She likes the way he dresses and talks. We‚Äôre similar in many ways, but he does things.. better? 

Because of prior experience with being cheated on, I have insecurities around ‚Äòcompeting‚Äô with other men in partner‚Äôs lives.

She has not given me any reason to doubt her and I know this is a me issue that I need to work on.

I asked her why they never sought each other romantically. She said it‚Äôs because they practically grew up together and sees him as a brother. Totally valid and rational.

However, my ex cheated on me with her ‚Äúbrother‚Äù so it‚Äôs hard for me to let this go mentally and I don‚Äôt want to sabotage our beautiful relationship. 

I‚Äôm worried that she will eventually see him more than a friend based on how they interact. I‚Äôm also worried that I am a second choice to him. 

****Women of Reddit, do y‚Äôall have a male friend who is like a brother? Why didn‚Äôt you pursue anything? Has your boyfriend ever expressed concern about that friend? Was your partner a second option compared to said friend?****

****Men of Reddit, does your partner have a male best friend? Do you ever feel threatened or jealous of him? How did you overcome that?****

Thanks for bearing with me. I‚Äôve been trying to work on my insecurities and grow but it‚Äôs been a journey. I am meeting up with him this week to get in the gym together and get to know him better.

"Mein Freund erz√§hlt Dinge weiter, die nie passiert sind 


Ich wei√ü garnicht wo ich anfangen soll. Ich (18) bin mit meinen Freund (17) schon seit knapp 3 Jahren zusammen. In letzter Zeit ist er sehr komisch und desinteressiert mir gegen√ºber geworden, fr√ºher haben wir uns oft gestritten wenn ich mal einkaufen gehen wollte oder ich 10min zu sp√§t von der Arbeit kam. Selbst wenn ich mal etwas zu lange duschen oder auf zu Toilette wa wurde er sauer. Er hat mir absolut alles erz√§hlt, wa nie herablassend und wollte immer mit mir etwas machen. Er hat mich √ºberall zu seinen Freunden mit mitgenommen und ich habe die ersten 6 Monate der Beziehung niemanden treffen d√ºrfen au√üer ihn. Also es war wirklich extrem. 

Darum geht es aber nicht, ich habe wegen den st√§ndigen Streits und weil ich absolut nix machen darf mit ihm vor ca 4 Monaten Schluss gemacht. Er meinte er √§ndert sich und wir sind wieder zusammen gekommen.

Er hat sich ge√§ndert, innerhalb eines Monats war ich ihm komplett egal. Ich durfte nicht mehr mit zu seinen freunden, generell ist er mit mir nicht raus gegangen. Er hatte immerwieder  andere ausreden parat. Ich musste ihn jedes Mal 3-4 Stunden wort w√∂rtlich anbetteln und weinen dass er sich mit mir trifft, ihn mit Sex, bestelltem essen, Zigaretten oder Drogen locken, oder ihm drohen dass die Beziehung bald vorbei ist wenn das so weiter geht. Jetzt k√∂nnte man sagen, ja er hat einfach keine Lust mehr auf die Beziehung, aber immer wenn er gemerkt hat ich bin dabei Schluss zu machen schreibt er mir Paragrafen wie sehr er mich doch liebt und will dass ich vorbei komme, weint und verspricht mit mir die Tage auf ein Date gehen so wollen. Nur um mir dann am abgemachten Tag kurzfristig zu sagen er hat doch gerade kein Bock, bleibt bei seinen Freunden und dass ich aufh√∂ren soll zu heulen weil ihn das ja nervt. teilweise hat er mir VON SEINER HAUST√úR weg geschickt. 

Mit mir redet er nicht √ºber was ihn in der Beziehung st√∂rt und seine Freunde m√∂gen mich alle nicht weil er denen jedes mal eine komplett falsche Geschichte erz√§hlt, lieber mit denen redet. Ich dachte, er erz√§hlt die Dinge eben aus seiner Sicht.

Die Tage habe ich bei √ºbernachtet und ich wei√ü das ist nicht richtig, aber ich wa an deinem Handy. Ich hatte langsam das Gef√ºhl dass ein anderes m√§dchen der Grund f√ºr sein Verhalten ist, immer wenn ich es angesprochen habe wurde er sauer und hat sein Handy versteckt. Au√üerdem wollte ich schauen was er √ºber mich erz√§hlt und wie er sich f√ºhlt. Ich bin eine Person die nichts b√∂se nimmt, ich wollte wirklich nur mal seine Sicht verstehen. Andere Frauen habe ich nicht gefunden, aber sehr viele Chats mit meinem Namen. Er hat seinen Freunden erz√§hlt ich h√§tte ihn mehrmals Betrogen. Er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich habe ihn oft beleidigt und ich h√§tte ihn geschlagen. Er hat Bilder von blauen Flecken geschickt und meinte ich w√§re das gewesen. Einmal hat er sein Handy im Streit kaputt gemacht, er hat ihnen erz√§hlt ich h√§tte es kaputt gemacht weil ich einen Chat mit seiner Schwester gefunden h√§tte und eifers√ºchtig gewesen w√§re. Ich wa davor noch nie an seinem Handy. Er meinte ich w√ºrde ihm verbieten feiern zu gehen, seine Freunde zu sehen und habe raus gefunden dass er sehr oft im Club wa oder nachts im Park feiern. Ich wei√ü nicht warum er das alles heimlich gemacht hat, ich habe ihm noch nie gesagt dass ich etwas dagegen habe und das habe ich auch nicht. Er hat sehr oft geschrieben ich h√§tte Schluss gemacht, w√§re mit Jungs drau√üen und betrunken. Fast allen seinen Freunden hat er am gleichen Tag geschrieben sie sollen mich auf insta blocken oder von der Story blocken. Er hat auch Freundinnen von sich geschrieben dass ich den Kontakt verbiete, welche die ich pers√∂nlich kenne und befreundet bin. Mir ist das so peinlich dass er so etwas behauptet. 

Ich habe auch Audios gefunden in denen er erz√§hlt er hat garkein Bock mehr auf mich und sich freut wenn die Beziehung vorbei ist weil er dann endlich wieder der Playboy sein k√∂nnte der er eigentlich ist und er nicht an die wahre Liebe glaubt. Das w√§re alles nur eine teenage Beziehung und die wahre Liebe kommt ja sp√§ter. 
Falls das seine ehrlich Meinung ist akzeptiere ich das nat√ºrlich, aber mir erz√§hlt und k√§mpft er eben f√ºr etwa komplett anderes und verachtet Leute mit dieser Meinung. 

Diese Dinge schreibt er erst seit dem er so extrem kalt (seit der Trennung) geworden ist, alles davor waren Texte in denen er sagt dass er mich liebt, sich freut mich zu sehen oder in denen er wirklich nach Rat wegen Streits fragt. 

Ich wei√ü nicht was das soll, absolut nichts davon ist wahr. Diese Sachen sind alle komplett ausgedacht. Was soll ich jetzt machen ? Ich kann ihm nicht sagen dass ich an seinem Handy war, er w√ºrde zurecht komplett ausrasten und das vertrauen w√§re kaputt. Bitte nicht blump ,,einfach Schluss machen‚Äú, wir verstehen uns eigentlich sehr gut und haben sehr sch√∂ne Momente zusammen, lachen und haben Spa√ü. Das Waren jetzt ausschlie√ülich die schlechten Dinge. 

Danke f√ºrs lesen vom langen Text, ich habe mir extra Reddit runtergeladen weil ich nicht weiter wei√ü üòÖ meinen Freunden k√∂nnte ich das nicht erz√§hlen.",drippy-goose,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15emqgv/mein_freund_erz√§hlt_dinge_weiter_die_nie_passiert/,1690825298.0,0.33
"It's only toxic if you treat people like shit. If you date someone who is a type of person you say sou won't date becasuse someone told you it was ""toxic"" not to and you are miserable about it adnd you treat that person like shit then that's toxic. If you didn't date those people that YOU know YOU don't want and treat the people that you want great then that's non toxic. 

You might not agree about someone's age preferences, single-mom exclusion, race exclusion, size exclusion, etc., however sexual and romantic attraction is irrational. There is literally no logical foundation in human attraction, which is a good thing. But just declaring it as ""toxic"" ""hate"" or predatory is just irresponsible, after all people's lives have been ruined by people just throwing those terms around.

If I said I don't  wan to date a single mom, and have sex with a woman who has given birth to a baby especially since I don't want my firs tome to be wiht a single mom, it would only be toxic if I DATED a single mom and would refuse sex and treated her like garbage.

If I had gotten a girl pregnant and she said that she wanted to keep the baby despite my reasons and said that I would not have to pay child support and I wasn't on the birth record, and I stayed with her, refused sex and treated her like garbage over it then THAT would be toxic. 

If I dated a girl who was overweight but refused to sleep with her and called her all kinds of names instead of simply not dating her or try to help her become healthy then THAT would be TOXIC.

If I dated a girl from a race or was bi-racial with a race I don't want to date and I called her derogatory names and cheated on her with ""white"" women than that would be toxic. And make me a cheating asshole. 

If I dated a18 year old at 34(age at the time of this writing) or 37 (the other person, I am going to talk about) So what? That does not make one a ""Predator"" or a pervert or whatever. 

There was this woman who was 37 and she was married to a woman who was 18 who did something that she found highly offensive, none of my business what it was but the people in the thread were just bombarding this poor woman with predator accusations based on the age gap alone without even knowing the relationship dynamic. Calling an adult, a predator for dating a younger adult based on age alone is evil full stop. Now if she was trolling around for 18-year-olds to date just because she perceived them as ""easy"" then that would be predatory. That's the definition of a predator. 

I said earlier that since I have never had a girlfriend, I'd like to date someone who is younger and would be objectively more attractive and I threw in the 18-22 range and I got the most insane comments, despite the fact I am not looking for them for any type of easy factor, I have just observed that those ages have the most physically attractive girls. These are legal adults. People vary in maturity at all ages but you would have to actually get to know them in order to see where they are at. 

Apparently it might not make for a ""Lasting relationship"" but why would a 34-year-old who has never dated and does not have a ""career"" or got to sow his oats want to set himself up for a 6-10 or even lifetime relationship the first time around, that's too much too fast and online (Tinder) I expanded my maximum age to 29. 

Those ages 18-29 have the least single moms, the least ""Jaded"" and the least emotional baggage. and most of the girls I have swiped yes to have been white women in the 22-26 years old range. People Panic about age alone without even considering it's the mentality of the people involved that determines whether it is predatory or not. 

If I found a girl who was 18 or even 17 by happenstance and we just liked and respected each other and set up appropriate boundaries and communicated, and decided to wait to do the deed clearly than there's no problem.

Hell to some wanting to have had more than 1 GF before you turn 40 is toxic too, it would only be if i lied to the girl and broke up with her making an excuse instead of being honest that we are not going to be super long term.

Not wanting to be married or have children is also not toxic, regardless of religion.

Never wanting to date your own race is not toxic if you simple are just not physically and emotionally attracted to your race. I simply am just not sexually attracted to black women, I don't harbor any hate and I don't treat them any different than anyone else, and even if I was into all races 99% of the people with the same interests and hobbies and beliefs as me have been white or other anyway and therefore would be on my radar to date.

Plus dating from a closer net type of community is just TOO familiar, and too the same, Its basically like a black version of Shiva baby to me in my community, it's normal to exclusively attracted to opposites, you learn more about the world that way. 

I love girls from Slavic countries with their lilting accents soft round faces and their down to earth despite being drop dead gorgeous demeanor. Apparently, that's toxic too.

Not everyone is a fetishist, predator who needs to sit on a bench, racist, fatphobe, homophobe, transphobe or ageist for who they want to date. You need to stop this shit today.

"Women are spoilt with choices with men and this is eating me up 
Women have so many choices on dating apps at least and men usually have to obey the lady. New to dating and this is eating me day by day up as it's so difficult to find someone. Many men want sex so women can keep blocking them and calling everyone a creep 
However, is the game same for a long term relationship? Women still have the authority even if a guy wants a relationship? Is this the same when it comes to physical interaction (not dating apps)?

"Fell for someone and it ended out of nowhere I met someone and we spent 2 mos together - he took me camping with all his close friends, introduced me to his daughter, and would spend every single night during the week at my house for these 2 mos. He told me he really liked me and he met my parents and celebrated my birthday with me. He said he wanted to take things slow, but he was the one who wanted to spend every night together and bring his kid to meet me a few times, and would even leave his dog at my house. I did tell him about a month into it that we should slow down a bit on the time together or else I would get attached but it was going so well so I took his drive to spend time together as a good sign. 

I was having a rough week last week and told him I wasn‚Äôt doing so well and needed some support and he pulled away and ended it the next day, stating he was ‚Äútoo tired with his job‚Äù and unable to treat me how I deserved. I did try to talk it out and say we could make it work with boundaries and not spending every night together but he ultimately said he made up his mind and left. 

I have started no contact and logically know it is for the better and it wasn‚Äôt that long of a connection but I feel like I‚Äôm having a hard time because it was going so well and I got so used to spending every single night with him and maybe fell for the potential I saw. Does anyone have any pointers to help move past this person? I just keep thinking of all the good stuff and hoping he realizes what he is losing and comes back.

*I just want to note that I have dated people with kids and I never once pressured him or wanted to take time away from him as a father.

"I'm guilty of it. I ghosted someone because I didn't know what to say. Last week I went out with a friend for dinner. We have a couple drinks, eat dinner, someone anonymously buys us another drink.

Cute and I've never received a number at a restaurant. It was put in the middle of the table, so we didn't know who it was for, but my friend is married so I texted the number.

"No amount of self-work and healing will grant you the love of your life This might be a hot take and not everyone will agree with me, but not amount of self-work, healing and being ""ok"" on your own will bring you the right person for you. 

I'm so sick and tired of hearing all these sob stories like ""I was in an abusive relationship, hopeless thinking I'd never meet someone"" and then after 3 months they meet the love of their lives because ""they worked on themselves and weren't looking"". 

I think also blaming the woman takes away the responsibility of a man - if he's a bad guy: it's your fault because you don't love yourself. 

Not because he's an idiot. Not because he's abusive and needs therapy. Not because he's an overall jerk. It's YOUR fault, because YOU allowed it. 

Now, let's say you find a good guy. You hear how lucky you are and how much you deserve it after all you've been through. It's almost like: good thing you went through all that trauma and abuse so it would lead you to a decent man. 

Instead of: holding men accountable for their actions. 

They'll say when you least expect it, someone shows up. But if you're not expecting it, then how did you allow this person to enter your life in the first person? Surely, a little bit of you was expecting it. I think that's another way of shaming single people who want a relationship, like, ""look at me, if you stopped acting so desperate you'd find your person like I found mine, because I wasn't looking because I'm super indenpendent"". And then you actually look at their relationship and the woman is super submissive or the guy is a door-mat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to stop looking. I've deleted dating apps and I'm currently not talking to anyone. I'm focusing on my goals, I'm spending time with loved ones and I'm taking up hobbies. 

Do you know what's been happening during this time in the romance department? Absolutely-fucking-nothing. You know what that brought me in this time? Two men in already relationships - one of them cheated and I found out later and the other one told me he was in an open relationship AFTER he pursued and kissed me. So yeah, wow. Even when I'm not looking, the trash finds me. 

Now, I'm not the most attractive woman in the world but I'm not bad looking either. I can say with confidence I'm better looking than a lot of other women. I know looks aren't everything, but let's start with that. Apart from that I know I had a lot of qualities. 

Yes I sound bitter, jaded and burnt out. And that's because I am. You can only take so much before you realize all you've been told your entire life is a lie. That going to college won't guarantee a job with good pay, that working on yourself won't guarantee meeting a partner.

"I think it's a red flag when a woman doesn't have male friends None of the Flairs matched what I'm trying to say, this is just an opinion.

I know the prevailing theory is often people being jealous and people saying they don't want partners with friends of the opposite sex, but I think it's a little weird when women don't have any male friends. Obviously there are exceptions to everything, and sometimes it may not necessarily just be that she doesnt want to have any male friends, but I think for most people having friends of the opposite sex is healthy and promotes growth and gives you insight from outside of your worldview.

"Ladies, putting ""I want the bare minimum"" in your description on dating app mean nothing Just like the title say, I just want to give a tip to all women on dating apps. Please don't write ""I want the bare minimum"", not because we don't care about your preference/standard, it's okay. The problem is the ""bare minimum"" mean nothing, it's too unclear for us (men). 

The ""bare minimum"" can mean making 6 figures, be above 6 feet, etc. or just be kind, respectful and honest .

Everybody have ""bare minimum"" so please ladies, don't ask for the ""bare minimum"", ask for what you want in details. It's a red flag when you ask for something, but when we ask you what you truly want you can't give a clear answer.

In resume, it's okay if you have ""standard"" to meet, but be precise about it.

"21 year old male seeking for advice, because he messed it up Hi people, recently I moved into a dorm. I had a girlfriend as well, but we recently broke up (not everyone knows this).   
From day 1 I fancied a girl, not because she was that good -looking, but something was just right about her appearance.  I did not have a chat with her. Last week we went out (she was not there) but I was with a few of her best friends and told them (while drunk) that I wanted to ask her out to the ball and that I found her cute. Her friends were really positive about this idea and said she would 99% surely would say yes.   
The next day a (girl)friend of her told her that she was not keen on it (the girlfriend is a bit into me and jealous) and her guy  friend did not really talk about it but hit on me (I am straight). She definetly knows that I am into her, and I would even say that the people I have told this about told me that I was above her league. Now I don't really know what to do because I 100% sure know that she knows, but I feel a very awkward vibe and we haven't even spoken yet, there is some overlap between our friend groups and sometimes we hang out together as a group.

"Disclose racial preferences up front Ever  realize someone didn‚Äôt  want a  serious relationship with you because you‚Äôre not white? They see you as fine to date, but they never saw you as someone they would enter into a serious relationship with and eventually marry. To those that say stick to your own race, then you could avoid this feeling but not everyone uses racial preference  as the only reason to try and date someone. If someone has on their profile they prefer same race or religion, I respect that and don‚Äôt consider that discrimation.  It‚Äôs understandable you would want to date closer to you in terms of ubringing especially if you are close to your family and are considering kids in the future. My issue is after dating someone and then getting the vibes they just picked you because you fit whatever sterotype and are suppose to be fun. Especially coming from someone who you thought was not race orientated. I am really sad because I really liked them. Not going to explain further since it‚Äôs too long to go into detail, but I got some comments that made me really uncomfortable.

"Problems of dating So I will talk about the dating life of the current generation and problems of it.
As I know from various  studies young men are having less sex with every year. By some statistics I came to the conclusion that it happens because some small percent of guys are getting the attention of all girls and all the other guys are getting nearly nothing. That top guys who get all the girls get overwhelmed by the amount of options they have and instead of getting a nice long term relationships they start just having one night stands with those girls or having some short term relationships with them just for sex. It results in girls saying that ""all guys are the same"" and ""all they want is sex"", but in reality all the other guys who just want a good healthy relationship can't get it and start hating on girls because of it. Also lots of guys get desperate and start ""simping"" for attractive girls or lower their standards to get at least something. That results in girls ego increasing even more and them only paying attention to top attractive guys which leads us to the start of conversation and gives us the full circle.

Recently I joined Hinge and after weeks of scrolling I found someone I have a lot in common with. My Bio specifically says ""platonic or romantic relationships are cool with me"" and I matched with this person not necessarily being fully attracted to them (because it takes me time, I guess you could say im ""demisexual"") Now we've been texting for a few weeks and she seems to already be interested in me romantically and I DO get a warm sensation and butterflies, I get antsy and flushed whenever she tries to flirt but I'm not sure if im feeling this way because im just excited to get attention from someone my own age or i'm falling in love. We also havent discussed exactly what our relationship is, her profile doesn't specify dating goals/type. So, are we just having fun? Should I go along for the ride? Should I clear the air and speak up about how i may not be interested, or should I just say that i'm new to relationships and she should be patient with me?

When I first got in my accident she told me she felt duty bound to look after me like a wife should but after a year or so she was slowly seeing me as a chore and not her husband. She said that not matter how hard she tried to see her husband all she saw was a fragment of the man she once married many years ago. Then she proceeded to tell me the reason she has become so cold towards me is because she has been seeking comfort with another man. She said to me when she started feeling this way she had counselling without me knowing and this led to her confiding more and more with her therapist until she grew fond of him. She told me when she was talking to him about our situation it felt like she was having the same feelings and emotions as to when we first starting dating and she couldn‚Äôt help it.

"The girl(23F) I‚Äôm talking to is hesitant to be with me(23M) because of female friends The girl (23F) I‚Äôm talking to is hesitant to be with me(23M) because of female friends

To give some background on our relationship, we‚Äôve been talking for a few months now. We were friends prior to talking, had been for about 6 months before we decided to want to be together. I‚Äôve known of her ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù (she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs toxic in her past relationship). Granted part of her toxicity comes her ex who said he had female friends himself and would be flirty with them. He didn‚Äôt make her feel secure in the relationship and had him stop hanging out with girls and then, he flipped it on her and had her not hang out with guys or girls since she‚Äôs bi. 

Now, up to this point in our relationship, we‚Äôve been good. We offer each other a lot of reassurance and she lives about an hour away from me, but with my work schedule and own tiredness, seeing each other is a struggle at times, but I do what I can to make it work. 

Recently she‚Äôs been bothered by the amount of female friends I have. I have respected the boundary she placed on not liking or heart reacting to different girl‚Äôs pictures on social media. I hardly bring up any or mention any girls cause it makes her uncomfortable. Now we are at the point of her being hesitant to be with me because of the amount of female friends I have. Given I don‚Äôt even really talk to any of them, majority of them. If anything it‚Äôs about two or three on any given day. 

I am stuck on what to do now though because I don‚Äôt want to have to drop my friends I do talk to, those I‚Äôve been friends with for years and still talk to.  I want to make this work between us but this has me stumped. She will always remain my priority and I don‚Äôt know how to have her feel/see that.

My take on the matter was quite different. Although I only had one short two year relationship

From 15-17 that ended in a friendly manner after we decided we both were going different directions in life but during that relationship I realized that from the point of the relationship being ""officially started"" and about 6-7 months after the relationship ended after I had started to get over her I didn't find other women attractive in the lustful sense I guess. Its like when speaking to a women that was attractive I guess my brain stopped processing other woman's looks for that duration so I never had the ""problem"" they had. this is kind of a contradiction but I could appreciate their beauty but it was the same as looking at a painting or the landscape after a hike are the closest things I could compare it to but their wasn't the ""attraction"" they said they have.

Now i know i made a huge fucking mistake asking that but i thought i wouldnt get insecure about it. 

That stuff is now in my head and i know its insecurities but we are both really,  and i mean really into each other,  and she said it doesnt matter and she really did her best reassuring me. But it makes me insecure thinking i wasnt her best first sex in the relationship experience and that i wasnt able to get on that level or if i can even topple in the future the best sex she had.

Now i know this is all stupid but we are quite madly in love with eachother, its the honeymoon phase and it (Mutually) this is like a unique one in a kind, or one in a million relationship where we really clicked almost literally everywhere insanely, so i have the desire to be the best or unique i guess.

They will message me saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out soon‚Äù or let me know they‚Äôre in town and want to make plans but then either cancel on me last minute/never follow through with making plans. WHY?! WTF is the point of reaching out to me and make it seem like they‚Äôre interested if they aren‚Äôt actually going to do anything about it. The last straw with one of them was when he texted ME first this weekend asking if I was in town for the weekend. I told him yes and asked if he was too. He said yes and asked how long I was staying. I told him how long and then asked how long he was staying. He goes on to say he‚Äôs planning on leaving Monday so it was probably the worst time for him to try to make plans. Like okay!? Why tf are you reaching out then. Anyway I was planning on just ignoring him but my friend persuaded me into giving him the benefit of the doubt on him just being a dumb guy and said I should just let him know I‚Äôm free today (Sunday) so if he was around we should do something. I figured it was worth one more shot. So I tell him and we plan to get dinner. I wanted to set a time because I usually spend the day with my family on sundays so I wanted to know when I should be free by, he says if it‚Äôs okay for him to text me in the afternoon once he‚Äôll know he‚Äôs free so I say that‚Äôs fine. Guess who got a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to hangout tonight :/‚Äú text! This clown ü§°. Im mostly mad that I gave this guy another shot after he‚Äôs repeatedly either left me on delivered mid convo or has fallen through with plans to meet up. 

Now I‚Äôm hesitant if I should even give guy #2 a shot beyond what I already have. We‚Äôve gone on one date and I thought it went great! He was even trying to ask me when I was going to let him teach me how to skateboard and saying ‚Äúoh we should go x‚Äù and spend the day in this town nearby. After the date I didn‚Äôt hear from him for a few days which I tried not to overthink it (even tho we had been texting almost every day before the date) an a few days later I hear from him. The problem is the convo was so dry and he took hours in between to respond that I didn‚Äôt even see his last text until the next morning and didn‚Äôt respond cause the convo was dead anyway. I was going to give up on trying further because I‚Äôll admit I tend to put up very high walls now when it comes to dating because of bad experiences in the past so now if someone isn‚Äôt meeting my standards or giving me the same energy I‚Äôm giving I move on. I told my therapist about this and she told me that when im in the ‚Äúgray area‚Äù of dating I can‚Äôt expect someone to give me 100% and be head over heels over me. To give them some grace. So anyway he ends up swiping up on one of my stories saying we should hangout soon. I tell him when I‚Äôll be back in town and he says okay to txt him and let him know. So once I‚Äôm back I txt him and we chat for bit and eventually i say ‚Äúbtw I‚Äôm back in town if you‚Äôre around we should hangout!‚Äù He responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely down to hang, I‚Äôm kinda busy the next few days but I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll link before you go back‚Äú. ??? I get him being busy but I would think that he would at least TRY to solidify some plans for sometime while I‚Äôm here? Am I being crazy in thinking this seems like he‚Äôs actually not very interested at all and just dropping this. 

I‚Äôm just so sick of the games and stupid bullshit that goes with dating. Like if you want to see me then fucking plan a date man. UGH. Vent over.",Motor_Solid8367,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dyv6h/wtf_is_it_with_guys_coming_off_as_interested_and/,1690756944.0,0.78
"First time in the dating scene and I‚Äôm interested in 3 guys at once including my ex and I‚Äôm a wreck HELP. (VERY LONG) Im 21 (F) and this guy, I‚Äôll call him Jeff is 23 (M). We met at work back in April when I first started at Amazon when I was having a panic attack trying to learn how to operate the fork lift and my trainer had to grab another trainer which was Jeff, because I was doing so bad. Anyways right when we made eye contact I felt so much tension and connection with him immediately that it was ridiculous. I just chalked it out to him just doing this with everybody because to be honest he‚Äôs the most hottest guy at the warehouse. I was also in a 2 year relationship at the time that I was planning to end, but I still held my ground and remained loyal. After Jeff trained me I couldn‚Äôt get over him, I was looking for him EVERYWHERE. and everytime i did find him, he was already looking at me, and even approached me to have a random conversation and walked away hinting that he only walked in the area to speak to me. At this point I became Joe Goldberg from ‚ÄúYou‚Äù and needed to find out his last name in order to find his social media. After hours of looking, I found him and BOOM, he was in a relationship too. I felt like this was gods way of testing me. I followed Jeff, Jeff followed me back, and no further moves were made and I‚Äôm Night Shift and Jeff changed to day shift so I stopped seeing him ever since. eventually I did break up with my boyfriend (not because of Jeff) but because of how toxic we were, I fell out of love and felt like I mourned about the ending of our relationship for a very long time he cheated in the beginning and I never got over it and spent the whole relationship letting it eat me up inside and I became toxic as a whole myself. I‚Äôve been feeling guilty about breaking up with my ex ever since because until this day he is still begging for me back. I know I know a 2 year relationship I should spend time to heal right? Nope, met someone else at Amazon, we‚Äôll call him Stan 23 (M) we connected, I began to really like him and been hooking up for months. Stan was infatuated with me while I was in a relationship and I continusly rejected him and when I became single I decided to see what Stan was about. good guy, but immature. doesn‚Äôt want to take me seriously because hes too insecure about the amount of attention I get at work that he feels if he did pursue me I would break his heart. so for this, he treats me shitty but I couldn‚Äôt help but fall for Stan bc I‚Äôm not shit and always attracted to guys who play hard to get. Stan revealed to me recently that I was the second person he‚Äôs slept with, I could tell he has severe trust issues and been hurt which I can‚Äôt help but understand where he‚Äôs coming from in how he treats me. He sucks at texting me back and communicating and for this, it makes me become clingy and emotional. His reasoning for not texting back is because we always talk at work anyway. Problem with Stan, is we been talking for 3 months and Stan has never asked me out on a real date, he only did once when I was in a relationship and i rejected. when I brought this up to him he says he refuses to ask me out on a date because i rejected him in the beginning and i shouldn‚Äôt expect him to give me the same energy just because i broke up with my boyfriend. he also says he‚Äôs only off on Sundays and uses that day as his rest day but will also be quick to get a day off to hang with friends. he told me once that he doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with me more because he has feelings for me but is scared to proceed further. I‚Äôve always tried to initiate us to hangout (which I‚Äôve never done to a guy) and got rejected all 3 times I asked, and rejected by just being ignored or being told he had plans. He proceeds to accuse me of talking and seeing other guys all while trying to kiss and see me on my breaks still to chat. we talk more than we hook up by the way so I don‚Äôt think us hooking up did damage. Basically this whole thing became a situationship, in which I feared. I really like Stan, but this week I seen Jeff‚Äôs social media and noticed he was single, he began interacting with my post and I slid in his dms starting a conversation about his photography, he ended up giving me his phone number randomly and INSTANTLY asked me on a date to the movies and a restaurant. he was already doing more than Stan. Me and Jeff went on this date yesterday and I know I‚Äôm young but I‚Äôve only been done wrong by boys/men most of the time, I‚Äôve always been the one begging and wondering why I‚Äôm not good enough. Jeff did everything for me that I only dreamt of that I felt like I was in a simulation. The date was great Jeff consistently spoke about how he couldn‚Äôt get over me right when he laid eyes on me, how bad he wanted to talk to me but held himself together since he was in a relationship. He said he never saw a woman and immediately felt like that she was the person he wanted to be with until he seen me, and proceeded to plan a second date with me. Since these two guys literally both work at Amazon I couldn‚Äôt help but decide to be honest with Jeff about Stan it was eating me alive the entire date. Jeff actually appreciated this, said it was a green flag that I felt comfortable telling him and told me that he could tell I felt bad about doing it and said he‚Äôs done things with people at work too and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been 3 months and he hasn‚Äôt taken you out. I had a 10 hour shift today and work in the morning and still made time for you and we just started chatting two days ago, just think about that. And I‚Äôm not telling you this in a ‚Äúi want you way‚Äù I‚Äôm telling you as if me and you were friends that If he wanted to make time for you he would have. You need to know your worth‚Äù I was expecting to get ghosted and called a slur. instead, I was given an eye opener. Jeff stated that he only wants me and has been sending cute lengthy messages since our date and literally wants to see me everyday. This dude is literally everything I wanted in a guy. I honestly thought people like Jeff don‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed by how nice he‚Äôs treating to the point I do feel like it‚Äôs too good to be true and that he‚Äôs love bombing me but to be honest I genuinely don‚Äôt think he is but I‚Äôm stuck between 3 different guys that I‚Äôm trying to convince myself bad things about each of them so I don‚Äôt make a decision I regret. this is super unlike me as I am very much a lover girl and not the type to entertain 3 different guys at once so that might be why I feel a ton of guilt every single day I wake up and breath. My ex is all I‚Äôve ever known honestly which is the main source of my guilt of having to let him go and see him with someone else would ultimately crush me. but what im doing I know would crush him.

"Matched with someone from my high school but we don't remember each other About 2 weeks ago i matched (on bumble) with a guy and the conversation died out pretty quickly. Fast forward a week ago, i was bored and scrolling on instagram, and found his account, i realised we had quite a lot of mutual followers and most of them were from my co-ed cheerleading team, save for a couple of cheerleaders i met outside of my high school.  
I decided to hit him up on bumble on Monday and ask if he was a cheerleader, and he confirmed it. We then realise that we were both from the same high school and same team but he was 2 years my senior, there were pictures on instagram where both of us were in it, just on different ends of the photograph. Had a good laugh because neither of us recognised or remembered each other, but to be fair, it has been 6 years since leaving cheer and i think both of us looked quite different since. I was also quite introverted and quiet, and he said he was pretty lowkey back then as well. We also don't follow each other on instagram.  
We texted a little everyday since but he hasn't responded to me since the weekend (2 days ago). Kind of bummed out because i was hoping we could've met and thought it would be a funny story or at least interesting to see if we would get along or be awkward, given our ""history"".

"My feelings are in limbo over a girl I feel I can't or at least shouldn't date. So I 22M am feeling frustrated, I'm in a situation where a girl (17) started to show some interest towards me and unexpectedly I've started to catch feelings which I did not expect nor had any intention of doing so.

**(Just to make things clear the legal consenting age in my country is 16 however people can and do feel strongly around this topic both irl and on reddit and so I made it on a throw away account, and to be clear nothing has happened between me and this girl anyways).**

I meet this girl through a mutual hobby. A few months ago I started to see this one girl around the gym about one month into us seeing each other around the gym (we do a combat sport) she started to come up to me and ask if I wanted to partner up with her during training. When I first started seeing her I honestly didn't think much of her at all, to me she was just another person that I would see at training. But once we started to partner up and get comfortable with each other I unexpectedly started to see her in a different way and she started to grow on me and I can't help but feel some kind of way towards her. Every time we train together we're always having a laugh and I genuinely enjoy her presence despite her being far more experienced than I am and often times she shows me up and I be looking like a absolute beginner around her its still fun.

I don't really know what to do because I've been single all my life and recently I've gotten my life together and in the past I didn't ever get any attention from woman and only recently I've been getting some attention from some woman but this girl is the first girl within the last 6 months where a girl has been interested in me and I've had some interest in her back, but of course there's a catch and it's her age.

I feel much more confident and sure of myself and as a result I feel I'm in a position where I would be confident and comfortable with actively pursuing asking for a number and setting a date up with someone that I know has some interest in me but I don't feel comfortable with doing such with this girl due to her age and I'm not sure what the reception would be like from those around me. And so here is where I feel frustrated because I have feelings and I see her and interact with her often but I can't do anything I can't pursue her I can't get her socials or ask out because I don't think it's a good idea and so my feelings are in limbo and what screws with me even more is that there's a degree of hope. This hope comes from the fact that I really enjoy the hobby and the training that I do and I'm sure I'm going to see her long into the future (she's really into it too) and so maybe when she's older there's a chance.

But for now I'm just gonna have to be mature and have my feelings for her remain hidden in limbo and just be training friends and not flirt or make any advances towards her, which fucking sucks. I feel worse too because I struggle with dating and I don't get many opportunities and I do have the thought of ""what if I don't find no one"".  


TLDR;   
A girl likes me and I've started to like her back but she's 17 and I'm 22M and now I feel as if I cant do anything with theses feeling and I'm just gonna have to be friends and nothing more but it sucks because I don't get these feelings often and almost is never mutual. And so its like what am I meant to do with theses feelings I see her all the time and I don't think its a good idea to even think of perusing.",__-Anonymous-_,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15edgsl/my_feelings_are_in_limbo_over_a_girl_i_feel_i/,1690802663.0,0.5
"Navigating dry texting after amazing 1st date I (25f) have been texting with guy (29m) from an app for about a few days. Conversation flowed well and almost immediately set up a date for early in the following week. We meet and things went extremely well, he was super complementary and mentioned several times that he could see this becoming something more. All in all, I think our date went incredibly well.

&amp;#x200B;

However, conversation over text has turned dry since our date but I had chalked it up to having touched many topics when we meet face-to-face. We had texted me good morning and goodnight the past few days since our date, but stopped two days ago and left me on read yesterday after asking how I was. He mentioned he got sick after our date earlier this week but had at least responded once a day to me which is the part that has left me confused.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing he told me was that I was the cutest thing he had seen all week ( in reference to a picture I sent him 24 hours before ) and how he was starting to feel better but spent the day in bed on a Saturday. I was told him about how I was at a concert and the act was running late and that I hope he was feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I would just let the guy just dictate how this will play out but that hasn‚Äôt worked very well with me thus far.  I‚Äôve never had a real relationship and I feel like I‚Äôve lacked agency in my dating life thus far. I've gone on other dates with guys but never anything that went past a couple dates. Simply living on ‚ÄúIf he wanted to, he would‚Äù mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don‚Äôt want to come off as desperate but I do really like him and don‚Äôt connect with many men this way very easily. I wouldn't normally be thinking about one guy so obsessively had he not been calling me perfect and telling me that I can delete my dating apps all throughout our date. Even after, he seemed really into me until our texting suddenly got stale.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to send him a silly meme based on our date/similar interest but now I'm overthinking everything based on a previous reaction to when I sent a silly meme to a fading attraction. I feel so juvenile and I don‚Äôt know if my irl friends understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I already know the answer but...any advice? Should I just double text him, send the meme, take the hint, chill out ???

I would ask him to hang out but I'm about to travel out of the country for a week and was hoping we could meet before. :(

"Met a guy I liked and he got a gf :))) Just a little sad.  I dont meet a guy i like often, but I met a really cute and nice guy at a study group about a month ago.  Just casual first meeting, not much convo.  Last week the group had a big party and we had a lot of really great 1 on 1 conversation.  He was always matching my energy. 


 He asked me and another guy if we could all go out to coffee and dinner.  He was always complimenting me, he said I'm like in angel and he even mentioned how interesting the complexity of my natural hair color was.  How it had some red and some gold color and that he thought people would pay top dollar to have my kind of hair.  Teasing me and just being super nice.  I definitely felt like it was flirting, but when the topic came around to dating I asked the both of them if they were dating, and he said he got a girlfriend just last week.

"Legitimately curious. Really looking at it I think the biggest problem with me dating is that I don't want anything. All of the perks and benefits of having a relationship sound great but like I don't actually want anything from another person so what am I supposed to ask for? It always came up on facebook. Mostly women, some men. What do I want in a relationship? Nothing. So there's nothing to really talk about for them because I don't look for validation from hardly anyone. Online dating became a huge frustrating loop of, not being rejected, but being matched and wanting absolutely nothing from another human being. I have had mental problems for a seriously long time and I've been in and out if therapy to mixed results. The things people say about talk therapy is true, it isn't very effective for people that don't trust the things you say. My first clinic refused to look into PTSD as a possibility. I know I have it now. After online dating I became incredibly jaded and just wanted to be left alone. Almost full social isolation. And in reality nobody else did anything to me. I took a part time job and I get much more social interaction than I used to. I'm realizing again that I'm more skilled with people than I credit myself.

I just don't know what I'm supposed to ask if, emotionally, there's nothing I need to ask for. I've heard worse stories of judgemental behaviour for others online I just have no control over my anger so I get swept up in the adrenaline and ride the high. People treat sex like it's the be all end all of everything ever but I couldn't care less about not having the attention. I hate having attention. It doesn't feel good, it feels anxious. It feels incredibly anxious. So anxious that I stop filtering my speech and start speaking like a madman. I've tried the meds, it just doesn't go away. 

I don't know hardly anywhere I can go where people would really like me. When I talk about things like Elden Ring here there are already people I 100% know they like it. I don't hardly want to talk about my hobbies with anyone in the world which means I don't want to interact with anyone either.",Reavere312,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15ecq1p/legitimately_curious/,1690800453.0,1.0

"Being a ""slow"" man...and wanting to fix it. I'm writing this after breaking up from a longer relationship and almost two years of being sort of miserably single: I'm not gonna lie. I should not have a problem meeting women. And I don't. I meet lots of women. I'm a tall, above average looking dude who owns a successful business in a creative field (32M). I have good fashion sense, I'm fit and like the outdoors, surfing, skiing, sailing, etc. I play in a band, I have a masters degree, a nice apartment in the centre of my city and have a lot of friends. Me writing this opening might piss some people off but it's relevant to discuss my situation I think. I live a happy life in almost every aspect, business is good, exciting creative projects are happening, but my love life is miserable. So what's the problem?

Women get frustrated with me. Or confused. They think I'm slow. I grew up with a lot of female friends so hanging out talking to girls come natural to me. Maybe too natural. I meet women, either through friends, social events, work or they just come up and strike a conversation at a caf√© or a bar or whatnot. And I respond. I like people so it's almost always a good time. The point of confusion happens after a while... contrary to what my bragging opening paragraph might signal I'm naturally a quite polite and humble person. I feel comfortable around women but I don't naturally code them as sexual partners. They might be a new friend. Or a new business partner. Even when I meet someone that I find attractive and might give me signals of interest my brain is slow when it comes to get into the mindset to make a flirty move and take the conversation from friendly to intimate or flirty/sexual. I typically want to hang out with someone two or three times before I'm there. I've come to understood that women get frustrated (several women I've had relationships say so, *""yeesh, lucky for us I was patient, I didn't know if you even wanted me"" ‚Äì my ex*) because I'm so slow. My experiences this past year is that the women I meet seem to except something else. Something quicker. Faster. Maybe it's my background that might lead them to expect a more aggressive behaviour. I'm not slow in business. I'm successfull in leading big projects with difficult people and I'm not a pushover. But something is different when it comes to intimacy and sexuality. That's another side of me.

I was just crushed because a beautiful girl with similar interests and a great mind that I like a lot ghosted me after our first real date. We've known eachother for 6 months through a working project where she came in and consulted. We had a strong connection and from the moment we met I understood she liked me. She would look deep into my eyes with the prettiest smile and come around and say hi when she didn't have to. It was clear that there was undertones of sexual interest. However, because we worked together and had a great collaboration going I didn't want to f\*ck that up and be unprofessional, so I waited until when the project was over before I asked her out. We had a great time and hung out for a whole day until late night, just winging it, doing various fun summery things around town and talking about life, ending up with a dinner and wine. When the time was late I called it a night, followed her to the subway and got that long hug where I felt that she wanted me to do a move. She did not want to let go. But I wasn't there. I wasn't ready. I asked her out again after a couple of days and I was sad to realize she's been ghosting me since. It frustrates me. It hurts me. I really like her and I feel like i dissapointed her. She's progressive but I know she likes conservative gender roles and I think she might've wanted someone more aggressive. She might've thought that I was someone else. Someone more like I am at work. I mean it might be something completely different, she might be in love with someone else or whatnot, she might've just used me for business reasons and wanted to see if I was down to f\*ck, but this happens over and over again so it's not just one case. I've met so many women after my break-up that I like and my brain picks up might be open to something more but by the time I'm there and am ready to explore it more they've already lost interest or misinterpreted me as not interested back. She's not the only one, there's been many other situations similar like this but she was extra special to me.

I don't have a straight question here but rather wanted to share my frustration and hear what you guys have to say, women and men. I guess there are bigger questions here as well about whats expected from men and women and gender roles in society and flirting. Do you have to be the one who makes the aggressive first move as a guy? I don't think ever a girl has kissed me first. I might point out that I live in a Scandinavian country so flirting is a bit more lowkey here than in some other places. It also might be that I hang out with too many women who have a certain view of successful men and how they ""should"" behave...they might be attracted to power or status and associate other character traits when it comes to flirting than I have. I'm open for critique and to hear that I'm all wrong:) I'm afraid that I will miss out on romance in life if I don't change and pick up on things faster. I want to fall in love with a nice person and have kids. What do you think? I'm considering trying to brake my pattern and force myself to try and be flirty quicker than what I would usually feel is ok when I feel it's wanted from the other person...but I think it will feel really unnatural to me. We'll see. Hit me with your thoughts.",mrcsrnne,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dtydn/being_a_slow_manand_wanting_to_fix_it/,1690745095.0,0.94
"Should i keep waiting? So, we met each other like a week ago already and since the beginning she directly said she liked me, etc

But she barely answered like, she talked to me a few minutes, and then she dissapeared the whole day until the next day near the same hour

Then she never answered back, until i asked her if she still wanted to talk (She answered a few hours later almost night), she like i said still acted extremely interested in what we could become together and said she's been really busy lately and she can't answer but that she promises me she won't let me go and doesn't want to stop talking, she told me that on Tuesday but hasn't answered since then after we talked a bit

So, i don't know lol Maybe i'm just fucking stupid and I'm just making things up to think she doesn't wants to talk (I have anxiety so, maybe that's why lmao)

"He lied on the first date So I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for two weeks now (M32 &amp; F28), and recently I found out that he told a little lie on our first date. I don‚Äôt really remember much from this conversation, but apparently I asked him how long he had been single for and he told me it had been a few months. 

Yesterday we were talking about past relationships and I find out that he actually just became single a week and a half before we met. It was just a short 5 month relationship that wasn‚Äôt super healthy by the sounds of it - so that part doesn‚Äôt bug me at all. What does bug me is the fact that he lied about the timeline so the truth wouldn‚Äôt scare me off. 

I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs kind of an awkward question to be asked on a first date (especially when you‚Äôre as newly single as he is), but I‚Äôm looking for something serious and longterm, so I often ask serious questions. 

He has since explained the situation to me entirely, admitted he lied and apologized a million times. We have had a lot of open communication about it, but it still really bugs me that he lied. I‚Äôm a super honest and open person and desire to find that in a longterm partner as well. Things have been going amazing with this guy otherwise, but I‚Äôm currently taking a few days to process this. 

What do y‚Äôall think? Let it go and keep seeing him? Or not worth the risk of more lies in the future?",General-Champion-377,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e1vnm/he_lied_on_the_first_date/,1690765073.0,1.0

"Got a date with someone I already talk to a lot Alright so I (m18) matched with this guy (m21) on tinder. We hit it off straight away with getting to know each other, a couple weeks after that we moved onto a different  app and started calling and playing games with each other every day for the past month, other than when he went on holiday for a week which for me was a test to see if he would still put effort into talking to me whilst he was gone, which he did! He would constantly send me pics of what he was doing and let me still be apart of his life. We would continuously flirt with each other and some calls could be going on for almost 10 hours. So I thought I‚Äôd take the risk and ask him on a date, he said yes and now we have a date next week!! The problem is when I meet him what if I don‚Äôt know what to say because we are so used to talking about the games we are currently playing together.

"Fiance going to bars- am I controlling? Also venting. I know a couple of languages and English is not my first language. Sorry in advance. 

I'm so sorry for venting but also need advice if im being controlling or what is going on with me. my girl n I had a agreement on no guys(4 her) no women 4 me. and no bars or strip clubs for any of us. Unless couple friends/co workers ect. She's also bipolar and has had a rough road of abuse in every way and being or ending homeless  as well as being a pushover and being taken advantage- I lost her for half a year in the streets of Oakland due to going in Mania...anyways going back to the main story. 

She met online a women and met at a bar which led to meeting another person from 4pm all the way to almost 4am in the morning she disregarded time and boundary we set tohether with excuses and her stories are not well constructed she kept talking to me about being at the girls house and she keeps saying he between the convos and so I said who's he? You keep saying he. Basically, she confessed that she was talking to guys only at the end before she left that woman's house. They were supposedly walking in as she was leaving and they over heard her talking about anime. She got extremely mad at me for asking who's he and how everything happen with he and started screaming at me, saying I ruined her night and she was so happy. Also she said she told them that im a big anime watcher so they know she was with someone but only after i asked questions. threaten me that she can't be with someone like me and that those are her new beasties. Something I learn about this new friend of hers she hangs out is that she goes to bars to pick up younger man and take them home. They even aperently pick up some guys at safeway that they remember from the bar(her new friends) And even today, she still trowing it to my face bringing it up, saying and getting mad at me and yelling at me, belittling me and threatening me with leaving and breaking my stuff or pc- I'm a gamer. 

Little more about me. I'm extremely patient and I try to speak with care and understanding now I do suspect that maybe she's heading towards mania. Last year when this happen she started to be  narsaccist- bunch of gas lighting and I thought it could he because of stress and being drugged by people she trusted.
 The reason why I am talking about this is because 

1. vent. 
2.you guys might have pointers in what direction I might take since there's wiser people out.

I did like one thing- she kept updating me and calling me throughout the day at the bar which I find weird- even call me if she can talk to a guy who was autistic and in a wheelchair.  but the only thing I asked her to do was to let me know when she got to said places fine with a address incase something happens to her. 

She did call me and invited me to come at like 2am when I was asleep and need to get up early at 6am. 

Also we agreed she was going to ask her docs if she can drink with taking meds for her bipolar. Which she never did when I asked her today.

Update for people who don't know the past and / or what's bipolar. There are different kinds, but one of them is hypermedia.

One. Her due to trust issues. But it's not even me either her whole family and the docs/ therapist tell her that she shouldn't be going out late nights or partying. She has a history of hyper mania. If you don't know what that is. Imagine this. She feels like she's God. She can walk in the street in front of cars. Fight people or even beat up her own family. And or one time, she said she was on fire in the middle of the street burning. When it was all on her head. 6 months straight of this. Being in the streets being raped
 Beat up and traumatized all because she wanted to have fun and smoked some weed, which was laced and trusted a dude. A drug that made her go into a mania episode. I wish it would be a week or a month, but no. I had to leave my job to go find her in the streets day and night. She kept getting out of the mental hospital because they thought she was just a druggy I had to fight with court to make her owned by the state, so she gets forced treatment. I'm just referring to why I'm a bit off. BTW, she just told me I'm not allowed to go bars because I could do something out of spite. Wtf???? I'm not even mad at her , nor have I brought up.convo again, so because she goes to bars, I can't go still........",DefiantAnalysis182,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15eav6q/fiance_going_to_bars_am_i_controlling_also_venting/,1690794475.0,0.6
"Have I been played? I'm a 17F and talking to the 17M i met approximately 4 months ago. He would be very engaging from the beginning, on text, in real life etc. We continued to go out but there would be times his behaviour would be cold or distant. But this would quickly go away and he showed large signs of affection (kissing my forehead, holding my hand, more subtle ways to be affectionate). He even seriously wanted our parents to meet and me to go over to his place etc but I felt uncomfortable. We weren't dating though it was kind of like an affectionate friendship that seemed a bit like a relationship. There were some times he insinuated making what we had ""official"" but I kind of brushed it aside because I wasn't ready for that yet. 

When I last saw him 3 weeks ago he gave me a letter, before i went overseas, where he confessed that he believes that he is in love with me and it were the kind of love where he wouldn't mind spending the rest of his life with me. I also sort of brushed it aside but insinuated that I felt something back but never a clear response.(He simply insinuated he would wait) And since then, he hasn't been texting the same at all, even taking 15 hours to respond when he isn't even busy. And when I fail to respond he doesn't even bother. He completely seems to have lost interest in 3 weeks of me being overseas but it seems he still wore my hairband around his wrist when he goes out.

"I am terrible at showing affection or expressing my emotions, and I'm scared I might ruin my relationship. I've only been dating my current girlfriend for a month now, but I'm completely in love with her. I get excited every time I see her, and I love every minute we hang out or go on dates.

On our third date, when I made things official, she told me a little more about her perspective about the relationship. She's been interested in me for a while, since we first met, and every time we make plans, she always tells me that she's fine with anything, as long as we're together.

The problem arose around last week, when we went out for coffee. I had met her parents just before, and I got along very well with her whole family; however, when we got coffee, she looked sad. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that I always seem emotionally distant. She also told me that she didn't know if I really liked her, and that I never talk about how I feel.

Growing up, I never showed or received much affection from anyone. I had trouble socializing with people, and I never really had the chance to talk about my feelings, so I learned to just keep everything to myself. I have a habit of bottling up my emotions, and not asking for help with anything. If ever anyone does ask me whats wrong, I just say ""I'm fine"" and move on. I've never told anyone I loved them, and I haven't hugged anyone in about 10 years, including family members. 

This has made many people angry with me, and I tend to not really care, until I met my current girlfriend. I want to tell her that I love her, but I don't know how. I want to show her that I care, that I like her, and I want to be open with her about my feelings, but I have no clue what I'm doing, and I don't want to lose her.

We talked all day everyday about everything including trauma and family issues which obvisley made us feel close as well normal things.

Tbh he had a fair reason.....I just ended my past situationship 2 days to matching with him and I told him I wanted to get tested for stds first just to make sure before meeting him.....I thought I was being responsible but the thought that I might have something turned him off so much he ghosted me.

But regardless it seems most or alot of ppl just jump into a new realtionship every few months and idk how ppl can do that without having their heart ripped out.

"Anyone feel like dating is too fast paced? I might just be naive, I'm 26M never had anyone (I'm quiet, don't like going out etc) and just got rejected after a couple dates and talking for a bit over a month, hung out a few other times.

I just feel like from reading lots of articles and posts/comments that people don't give anyone the time or effort to get to know one another. Maybe I'm just not a good people reader but I feel 1-2 dates is not enough unless of course there is an immediate reason to not see this person anymore. 

Another thing is the ""spark"". I feel like people are going around only focusing on feeling that immediate connection, looking for instant gratification and focusing on the reasons to not date them. Again, people have every right to do this but I feel dating apps/society/movies have given people unrealistic expectations of partners because they can just simply message the next person on their phone. But saying that, I can understand that people don't want to waste time. But then again, I'm a quality over quantity kind of person.

She told me she felt safe and comfortable and that I was a breath of fresh air for once and said I'm an awesome person etc. We had some things in common but she didn't feel a strong spark so we should just be friends. I respect that but I just don't really understand it. Like, why not try and build a connection and look for reasons to be with this person until the reasons to not date them overwhelm those. Try and make you're own spark and build your own fire, because I feel like that is way more beneficial down the track if things get rough because you can fall back on your core values of what you built together rather than falling back on nothing but infatuation.

That's just my 2c anyway.

Before seeing everything we had talked for about ~3 months and at that time I decided to book a flight to her country to visit and now being ~11 months in the time is coming close. 

My questions is If I am not attracted to her in real life how can I let her down nice and gently in her country?",Mysterious_Screen850,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e7yb8/unique_situation_any_advice_needed_breaking_up_in/,1690784391.0,1.0

"(32m) Last 4 women have each ended it with me after at least one date with some variant of ""can't be in a relationship right now"". What am I doing wrong? I've been looking for a long term relationship, but I keep finding myself in this situation where the woman says she's realized she's not looking for that.

Please tell me what I'm missing or doing wrong, what I need to fix because while they have all been very polite and thoughtful in ending it and I'm surprised and grateful they haven't ghosted me because it seems so common online. The theme of them expressing a disinterest in pursuing a serious relationship is making me wonder: **what the hell it is I'm doing wrong so consistently?** (and why is it so obvious to four different women, but not myself).

It's been after after a date with no kissing, after going to bed together on the second date, after going to bed multiple times - all different. So it's not like ""they just used you for sex"". There's no pattern, it's not like there's a behaviour or action that I've done that I can point to that makes it clear - ""ahh it's when I said this obviously egregious thing"". They all had different professions, different ages. Some there were hours of phone calls before the first date, others it was just messaging then date.

Here's the kicker though: I met all of them on Hinge, the dating app that markets itself for something more serious. How's that for irony?

The only possible common denominator left is **me** : but they have all been at pains to soften the blow with the classic ""it's not you it's me"". But 4 times in a row? Come on. Twice is a coincidence. Four times is a failure on my part.

I am honestly clueless as to what personality flaw or behaviour I'm exhibiting that is at the root of this.

In the interest of producing context but at risk of flattering myself, the only possible explanation I can fathom is these women were on dating apps without the intention of actual commitment in the first place? I base this on the fact that one of these women literally said to me in what sounds just too flattering to be true that she was ready to delete Hinge because her career was taking up too much of her time and she didn't want anyone in her life, but then I managed to grab her attention and she (with some goading from her friends) decided to see if she could make it work. But... obviously, she couldn't. If that's true I interpret that to mean I'm quite simply looking in the wrong places, which begs the question of: okay, where are the right places?

The bottom line is I'm trying to look at this as an opportunity to improve and develop further as a person. Of course I have flaws, but I don't know what is the root cause here, and therefore I'm unable to take meaningful steps to fix it - despite being eager to do so.

"Types of ‚ú®men‚ú® So we‚Äôve all heard of Schr√∂dingers cat right? That experiment? I think all of us studied about it when we were in school, no? 

But here‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not JUST a cat. Confused? Let me give you an example using the world of ‚ú®dating‚ú®.

Now for those who are straight, Bi, gay or anything but a lesbian, Cis-het men is usually a category one comes across.
But in this category, there are various sub categories (kinda like the various voice modules in my head that are narrating what I‚Äôm writing, but that‚Äôs not really the point). Here are the sub categories:-

1. Fucboi - naam hi kaafi hai. Sab ko use karte  hai like baap ke Diya credit card. Who cares if the damage done is higher than the damn credit card bill? At least I have given myself some self care and confidence Na üëÄ. They will use anything and everything to get you hooked to them. And like a fresher who has just scored their first job at corporate they‚Äôre supremely adjustable depending on what they think will help them land their target. I say target because at this point we‚Äôre nothing more than a bulls eye for them. You hit the bulls eye, someone calls you daddy and then your inner Ariana Grande comes out screaming thank you next.
2. Case study : these are the men whom we talk about on group chats, with our best friends, when we catch up over drinks and then psychoanalyse the fuck out of them because daaru k baad toh bc hum hi Freud ka prot√©g√© hain. Now here‚Äôs the thing. These men could be the bestest creatures we‚Äôve ever known OR they‚Äôre the red flags üö© who inspire the commandments of the sisterhood. Does he only text you after or at exactly 2:00 am saying wyd or I miss you or u up? Behen he‚Äôs a laal jhanda. At that point other than his hormones and PP are the only things up. He‚Äôs going to go back to ignoring your existence and gaslighting you because if his loins are on fire then everything around him, including you, needs to be on fire. Does he send you a text apologising for the lack of responses because it‚Äôs been an overwhelming day and he wants to make it up to you by coming over with your favourite take away and watch your favourite movie? RUN STRAIGHT INTO HIS ARMS AND STAY THERE. &gt;insert pedro pascal‚Äôs voice&lt; he‚Äôs got you babygirl.
3.  Oedipus or Mumma ka sher: door se Bohut hard. MC Sher ko bhi kha jayenge. Bhagwan Kaun? Apun hi Bhagwan hai. BUT MUMMA KI PHONE AAYI TOH PHATA HUA BALLOON KA TARAH SAB HAWA GAAND SE NIKAL JATA HAI. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs not married to his mother. You think his Desire to be squeezved between your boobs is because he‚Äôs attracted to you but NO it‚Äôs actually because it reminds him of the times he‚Äôs been breastfed by his mummaaaaaa.
4. Men written by women: these are the boys/men who genuinely understand the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù. They don‚Äôt boast about the fact that they LET you pick the restaurant. They don‚Äôt tell their friends that they LET you wear the clothes you wear. They‚Äôre the men who help you with your with the pleats of your saree, enthusiastically take part in skin care routines with you, aren‚Äôt afraid of being vulnerable around you. They‚Äôre the kind who normalise being called a feminists, they use their privilege to call out locker room talk, they don‚Äôt tolerate that shit. They remember your favourite coffee order or pastry or kfc order and the likes. And boiiiiiiii can I tell you is that a turn on. Like respectfully Sir, you have permission to rearrange my biological being with junior. Thank you very very much. No, honestly it would be my HONOUR TO BE REARRANGED LIKE THAT.

And FINALLY the best for last.

5. ‚ú®Schr√∂dingers Chutiya‚ú® : they‚Äôre dangerous. Not the you need to get a restraining order dangerous. But the ‚Äúmake you fall for me and now you‚Äôre unconsciously rearranging your life around me but imma still not date you‚Äù dangerous. If there were a traffic signal, you‚Äôd see all the damn lights on. They love living in plausible deniability. It‚Äôs always 5 steps forward and then ten steps back. One minute you‚Äôre all consumed with their love and üå∂Ô∏è spicyüå∂Ô∏è talk, the next minute y‚Äôall are still talking but the love ain‚Äôt the same they get weird if you bring it up. And the thing is no matter how many times you tell yourself no more, they know EXACTLY how to wiggle their way back in. They don‚Äôt come to get their dick sucked or stroked. They‚Äôre here just for the way you fawning over them makes them feel. Who needs to buy a gaslighter or match box to put your stove on when these fuckers exist? And whenever you ask then for clarity, they‚Äôre always lost and can surprisingly never remember what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it that way babe‚Äù oh really?

"Advice needed Just looking for some guidance

Hi! 

I (25f) have been seeing a guy (28m) for about 3-4 months now. Neither of us were looking for anything series. We agreed friends with benefits. Welll‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve grown super close and things are going great. We do date things and have a really good time. 

He is in a sticky situation because he still lives with his ex(their lease ends this month). He stays over my house probably 6/7 days a week. I‚Äôm worried that he‚Äôs just staying with me right now because he‚Äôs in this situation. I‚Äôve mentioned how I‚Äôve developed some feelings for him and he admits he does like me and cares about me but he‚Äôs just always been in a relationship and they‚Äôve all ended terribly. 

He just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship right this second.‚Äù Which my ex also put me through hell so I understand and I can‚Äôt imagine still living with them. 

Idk I just don‚Äôt want to waste time. I see posts like ‚Äúif he wants to he will‚Äù but after being through some traumatic shit I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy. 

The other night he was drunk (which I know üôÑ) and he called me and talked to me for 2hrs about how he wants me to be his girlfriend and how he wants me to meet his family but he just doesn‚Äôt know if he can handle another split from everything again. The next day I asked if he remembered our convo and he said ya some if not most. And I asked him about specific things and he was just like well ya I care about you and I love spending time with you I just don‚Äôt want to fuck everything up.

"How to get over a past f-up? \*Throwaway account

I recently reached 30 (male, btw), and up until now I have never been in a serious relationship. There were a few casual dates here and there, but nothing too serious. I also was really focused on my studies (10 years to get an undergrad, but that's a story for another time), and dating always has been an afterthought for me. Also, no ""this is the one"" moment for any of the women I've met.

On top of all that, I had a big f-up that no one knows about; I got scammed into masturbating in front of a camera in front of a girl I met online, then whoever was behind the camera began to blackmail me. Thankfully I mamaged to bring everything under control within a few hours, without no one really seeing my dick pick.

I feel so ashamed, humiliated, and angry over what has happened. It has also definitely made me less trustful of others. As in, I can't trust anyone to open myself up, as well as not trusting myself to being honest to what has happened to anyone unfortunate enough to date me.

So as the title says, how do I get over a past f-up, and learn to trust myself and others? There's this girl (29f) that I've met at volunteering and I find her to be an amazing person, and I am crushing on her pretty hard. I of course try not to be too obvious or look like a creep about it.

"Obsessives thoughts and intense negative feelings after one date, am I okay? Hello, I (28M) am writing this because of a dating situation I just went through and would like some advice/feedback in order to alleviate the feelings of worthlessness I often experience after I am rejected.

A few months ago I moved across the county to a city where I know nobody. It's a great career move for me but I need to start my social life from scratch. I've talked to some people in my apartment complex and made some friends. One of them invited me to a kickball league and I met a girl on the team. She DM'd me via GroupMe a few days ago, clearing indicating interest. I asked her out the next time we had a kickball game and we set up a date for the following day.

The date was great, I had a great time and I am confident she did too. We ended up having sex at my place, which in hindsight is where I think I made a mistake. Due to insecurities in the past I do not have a lot of sexual experience. I had a girlfriend for about 6 months in college, where we had sex frequently. I also did some casual dating about a year ago and only had sex once during that time. Outside of those two situations I haven't been having sex. Since I am relatively inexperienced I think I may have fell short of her expectations.

I tried to set up a mini golf date for this evening, and she gave me a maybe, recently followed by ""I don't think I've got it in me tonight"" and no attempt to reschedule which I read to mean she has no interest in going on another date. Her best friend is on the team so I may ask her if I should just assume we'll be friends from her on out, but I am for sure getting the vibe that she doesn't want to see me again. 

Ever since our first date (Tuesday) I have been thinking about her nonstop, obsessing over whether or not she wants to see me again. When she finally gave me the bad news I felt like I didn't want to live anymore. I am just crushed. A big part of the reason I am so inexperienced in dating and sex is because of the intense feelings this sort of rejection would induce in the past. 

I know it's perfectly normal to be upset in this situation, but I would really, really like to stop the obsessive, intrusive thoughts. I don't think its normal. It's only been one date and I can hardly focus at work. I go to bed and wake up thinking about her. She's on my mind when I am working out, watching TV, and playing video games with my friends. I feel like a desperate loser for putting this much attention and emotional energy into a person that I barely know. We get along and had one good date and we had sex once. That's it.

I have a great career, I am fit, and I am successfully developing a social life in a cool city where I don't know anyone. On paper, these things seem like a great successes and I should be proud of myself. On the inside I continue to feel desperate and unlovable. I can't seem to help but allow women to dictate my self-worth and command my attention. I tell myself that I shouldn't let somebody I hardly know control my self esteem, but my brain continues to obsess and I don't know how to make it stop.

Is this a common experience or am I mentally ill? Does anyone have any advice for me? Am I a complete moron for sleeping with her on the first date? I probably should have focused on developing an emotional connection first given that it's unlikely I'll be able to blow her mind in the bedroom without more experience. Is it always a bad idea to have sex on date #1 if you think you want a deeper connection?

Any advice is appreciated. I am happy to provide more information if it would help. Thanks for reading.

"Trying to see where things go again for the 4th time in almost 2 years (20M,21F) Before I get into the meat And potatoes of this connection, let me give some context. For one, he is in the military, the army, to be exact. We started talkin briefly after I had to put my dog down. When we met, he was separating from his now ex-wife. There is a child involved. 

We met during the week of December 2021, going into New Year's 2022. We were both young 19-year-olds. I had my apartment and car at the time, and he was a young careless private. We did meet on Tinder, of all places, and instantly clicked over text. Not too long after, we FaceTimed, and oddly enough, I thought we would stay friends cause we clicked so well. Soon enough, I drove 40 minutes to the base to meet him for the first time. I was anticipating just hanging out and wasn‚Äôt nervous at all. Then his 5‚Äô11 buff built self came in.  We locked eyes, and my entire body was stunned. He felt familiar. There was a spark, for sure.
I let him be my passenger prince and play music. We pulled up to my place and ate the pizza, he put on one piece, and we were lying watching the movie. One thing led to another, and we were two young 19-year-olds fuckin like bunnies. From there, a very intense, lust-fueled, and passionate relationship blossomed. The conversations were in-depth, diverse, and intriguing. The sex was great. Overall was a great addition to my life and company. I‚Äôd like to have around for a while. Keep in mind while this was all happening, he was divorcing his wife. He also wasn‚Äôt able to see his at the time one-year-old daughter. I would ask here and there how he felt about it, but he never liked talking about it too much. I didn‚Äôt want to prick and pry, so I left it alone. By the end of the month, his divorce was about to be finalized. Based on how we discussed things, I thought we were building something for it to be official in 5-6 months. Boy, was my little mind wrong lmao. He slowly started to pull away. I began chasing.
By my birthday, I ended up cussing him out over text and blocking him cause he couldn‚Äôt reach out and say anything. I was crazy and called him from a burner number, and he instantly answered. I know that is mature of me‚Ä¶ I left it alone. I was heartbroken because I felt like he had ghosted me on my birthday. I was fine for a few months, and then I reached out again in April of ‚Äò22. He apologized for doing what he did and said he didn‚Äôt do the arguing, so he just pulled away. Plus, his divorce was a lot on him.  I was understanding. I was going to let him come over again, but he ended up flaking again. I ofc got mad and blocked him because he buttered me up, got NSFW vids, and dipped. I stopped fw with him for damn near the rest of the year, but after him creeping into my mind again, I reached out in December of ‚Äò22. By this time, my car was long totaled (not my fault), and I moved back in with my family as I couldn't afford to live alone. This time his depression was apparent. He said he felt numb daily, but I made him feel something. He was sorry for everything he did to me, but he wasn‚Äôt in the space to give me what I wanted, but in the future, he did. He said he missed me and that I didn‚Äôt deserve all that he did to me. We had sex in his car that night, and then he was off to Korea. While he was in Korea, I tried to be friends with him, but we simply had dry conversations, besides when I told him a guy had violated me. Now this has all culminated to the present day. I hit him up last night. We had such different energy this time around.
We discussed the past, and I apologized for every time I spazzed out. He didn‚Äôt deserve it. Every time he stopped talking was because he was overwhelmed, depressed, working, or I cussed him out. He picked me up, hugged and kissed me, and opened my door. Then we drove off. We caught each other up about what‚Äôs been happening since we last spoke; I listened to his stories in Korea; I told him how I went to the club with a girl who ended up trying to fight me and how I‚Äôm taking summer classes. We laughed and overall had a great time. This was the first time we hung out without having sex. I asked him straight up if he wanted to go with the flow. He said yes, and we agreed to take baby steps. He dropped me off, kissed me a bunch while hugging me, and drove off. Should I take this chance? I saw our growth, but I don‚Äôt want the same story ending. I‚Äôm 4 months celibate, and been really focusing on myself. I‚Äôm open to having him in my life again cause we can go to the gym together, get money together, and see if we can build something. At the same time he has a avoidant attachment style while I have anxious attachment style. I wanted to add his child lives in a different state with her mother and her boyfriend. He and her were in a bitter custody battle, and he did lose. He was homelessness a couple of weeks, and has only semi-recently stabilized himself. He tries to see his baby as much as possible, but because he can literally be deployed at random it‚Äôs hard to coordinate anything in person, so he FaceTimes and calls her.",throwawaybby02120825,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e51u8/trying_to_see_where_things_go_again_for_the_4th/,1690774550.0,1.0

"Should I tell my new GF that one of my friends is my ex? I dated a girl when we were pretty young  13-14 for about a year. In it the relationship was a lot things, very few of them good. But in the end it ended in a rather amicable fashion.

We cut ties for a while, probably 2 years or so maybe less before we ended up speaking again over Discord.

That was back in 2020 and now in 2023 we're rather close friends, I ended up joining her friend group who, for the most part are unaware we dated. She found a boyfriend for herself dometime during our cut connectio  who I'm also friends with (and is aware of our past) through the group. And honestly calling it ""her"" friend group feels weird I'm just a member of the group now they're my friend group too. At the news I had found someone she was really excited to meet them because, well I'm advancing in my life and that's something we both celebrate for one another.

Anyway all this to say we're pretty close. But there's absolutely 0 spark remaining between our different partners. We both want whats best for eachother, support eachothers goals and dreams, share memes and laughs and jokes and reminicse about our childhood, entirely ignoring the fact we dated throughout it. It is merely a mutual, close, friendship.

Which is where my new girlfriend comes in. In a friendship where our past is still obscure to a lot of our friends because its ancient, dead and buried history, is it worth all the drama to even call her my ex over, childhood friend when introducing her? 

I want what's best for my new gfs emotional wellbeing and this is, unfortunately something I'm not always good at reading. The idea of betrayal if someone offhandedly mentioned we dated does make me worry about lying, especially because its not exactly a white lie, but I hear its a big red flag to be friends with your ex but I'm kinda in too deep to stop it now. Not without causing a big rift across my friends. Plus I don't want to stop being friends!

"[30M] When life is a hall of mirrors... The last few years have been difficult for me as my disease has progressed to the beginning of the end stage. It's come with a long list of realizations, compromises, and acceptances. I've always had to overcome adversity my whole life, but I always could adapt, rebound, and succeed. This time the damage and loss is permanent, there's no going back, and going forward means losing the rest of what's left of myself and who I am piece by piece, day by day, and I've already lost too much. It's warped and destroyed my life and completely turned my world inside-out. What's more, it has overtly changed the way people react to and treat me. Especially when it comes to making friends, and double especially dating. And by that I mean they just avoid me, altogether. It's made this period of my life extremely difficult and solitary.

I've spent the last several years completely alone. No friends, no romance, minimal interaction with the outside world. Not by choice, and not for lack of trying. And the truth is it's killing me faster, especially when people lead me on instead of just having the guts to say ""no"". Which would hurt a hell of a lot less than blown expectations. But when you're looking down the barrel of life, with Death patiently waiting for you in the cylinder, it really makes you realize what's important. I have so much left I need to do, and I don't want to finish this life alone.

I don't want sympathy. I just want someone to treat me like a normal person again. I want the same chances you'd give anyone else. I want to be looked at like a human being when I'm in public instead of with sympathy or repulsion. I'm a person, too, regardless of any medical issues I may have. I know I deserve the same shots at friendship and/or love as everyone else and, though I don't say it, it literally sickens me that I have to practically beg people just to interact with me for 30 damn seconds. I can't imagine what it'd take me to get a phone number.

Blemishes aside, I am an amazing and loving person who has lived a beautiful and full yet tragic almost 31 years. There is so much more to me than the conclusions people draw with one glance. It breaks my heart that people can't see past the tragedy and take a chance on me for everything else I am inside rather than everything I am at face value.

Hopefully there's still someone out there that can see past the rust and grime, with the patience to get to know me for the person I am. If that's you then send me a message. I would genuinely love to talk to you, especially if you're in the PHX area.

"My fifth date‚Äî‚Äîabout my dating experience on a herpes dating site Navigating the dating scene as someone living with herpes can be complex, but a herpes dating site has made things considerably simpler. This is the account of my fifth encounter on this platform, a one-night stand with a woman, shared in a mild and straightforward manner.

This woman, let‚Äôs call her Jane for the ease of this narrative, had an online presence that resonated with me. Harboring a common ground owing to our shared experiences, we started conversing and developed a reasonable rapport. Eventually, we agreed on meeting in person at a nearby bakery.

Our real-life interaction was no different from our online conversations: comfortable and engaging. Jane was equally charismatic in person, and our conversations flowed naturally. We spent the day discussing our interests, sharing anecdotes, and gradually feeling more comfortable with each other.

As it grew late, Jane invited me over to her place. Maintaining mutual respect and understanding for our situation, we mutually decided to extend the boundaries of our relationship. We both knew the precautions and boundaries required due to our condition. Consent was a crucial part of our interaction, and we did not disregard it at any point.

Our one-night stand was gentle and respectful, nothing more than an extension of our connection. We both respected each other‚Äôs spaces and understood our circumstances, making our intimate interaction less daunting and more approachable.

"How should I approach this situation? So one of my batchmates from college just moved in near my house and we matched on Bumble. We never really talked while in college but I did have a crunsh on her at the time. But right now she didn't make the move in 24hrs and the match expired. Talk about timing being everything.

But as we were in the same college her profile on instagram was easy to find. Should i make the first move instead ?

Adding to the intrigue, there's a lurking suspicion about her profile's authenticity. Catfish tales are all too common in the online dating scene. I was thinking maybe I could use something I saw in this video , you know send her a DM saying ""we should take it of Bumble.""

I am afraid of the possible gossips in the back If I make a move considering we have a lot of common acquaintances ,but strangely, no common friend to pave the wayWhat if she's just as hesitant as I am?

But amidst all the excitement, there's a tiny catch - I'm not exactly a master conversationalist. It's nerve-wracking to think that after all this buildup, I might fumble on the conversation itself. But if I'm taking the plunge, I need a brilliant icebreaker to set the stage for a chat.

I had a feeling that we don't have the same long term goals or plans but kinda got pressured into asking her out ( I did/do like her). The date went well but it confirmed my fears.

Since the date, F and I still flirt regularly but nothing has happened. She has drunk text me a bit.

Last week she drunk sent me a selfie with her best friend P and I said you guys look hot

P messaged the next day and we started chatting. It was harmless to me because I thought she had a boyfriend and I'm literally flirting with her best friend. However the messages got really flirty and she eventually said when are you taking me out on a date? 

I even said something like I guess we will have to keep this quiet and she said why? 

I dont really see much happening with F and want to kinda see P but feel awful and also dont want to hurt F.

Do I just play along for now? do I speak to P and ask if shes told F or do I just pull out altogether?

I have baby stuff already. I‚Äôve been getting stuff for the past decade. I have stuffed animals and a few sets of clothes and blankets. I thought I‚Äôd be a mother by now.

I‚Äôm so frustrated. I never imagined my life would be like this. I thought I‚Äôd be married. I‚Äôve been asking guys out for fifteen years. Nothing good has happened. I don‚Äôt even try to get guys that are way too hot for me. I ask out normal guys.

"8 Red Flags to notice and consider when dating someone seriously. This is based on a recent experience I had (31 y old male) while dating an older woman. These are 8 things to watch out for because they could prevent long term longevity.

1) Controlling 

Seeks to rule with a presiding authority over how your time is spent, and who you are allowed to associate with. Devalues your social circle in attempt to create codependency based isolation. Wants to shape your life into a submissive role that supports their own world, and their own goals while marginalizing your personal ones. Wants your behavior to be reflective of what they say is or isn‚Äôt acceptable, any violation of which could result in consequential punishment. 


2) Manipulative 

Utilizes coercive tactics to enforce their desired end results, including punishment/reward mechanisms. Instead of compassion and respect being given freely out of love, any attention or admiration must strictly be earned through adherence to the rules they set. Time of your own is largely nonexistent. You have to always be available when they need you for something or when they feel ‚Äòlonely‚Äô.


3) Overly Critical and judgmental 

The past is never the past, and instead of seeing the best in your potential, they will frequently bring up your previous mistakes to devalue you, criticize you, or make you have feelings of shame and regret. You apologize more than once for problems that you are wanting to move on from. They can‚Äôt let go of their resentment towards you. You may even be extremely accepting of things they did wrong while they are the complete opposite towards you.


4) Avoids admitting fault or accepting blame 

They avoid accountability 90% of the time. Sometimes they deflect from their actions by blaming you. Also known as blame shifting. You stop bringing up things you disagree with because you know it will likely never be resolved. You are never allowed to win an argument and they rarely if ever apologize for any of their own behaviors.


5) Lack of empathy 

When you are experiencing a difficult time in your life, they have no empathy for you. They accuse you of playing the victim. Instead of expressing care and concern, they tell you that you are weak or they make comments to disregard your thoughts and feelings. They don‚Äôt want to understand what you‚Äôre going through. You‚Äôre supposed to be happy and joyful in all circumstances. Their version of ‚Äúcheering you up‚Äù is typically unsupportive and mediocre.


6) Lack of intimacy 

They don‚Äôt show you affection often, and will stop you from initiating most physical interactions. You have to earn their affection and only on days when they aren‚Äôt too tired will they kiss you, or touch you. Leaving you feeling undesirable, or that this person doesn‚Äôt actually like you as a person. If there is an imbalance in this dynamic, it will lead to other problems in the relationship.


7) Temperamental 

Easily loses their temper at the slightest turn of events. Reactive to outside pressure with intensity that may result in being yelled at, or punished and berated. If they don‚Äôt get their way, someone has got to pay. Vengeful and cunning. 

8) Lazy, unmotivated 

They only have the energy to perform tasks that serve them and very little if any time to entertain your own ideas of a good time or how a day should be spent. They prefer to be lazy when it comes to things that you want to do. Your schedule revolves around their plans. You get used to not having any free time.


If you have any additional ones, let me know below. If you‚Äôre successfully or not in a relationship that has any of these dynamics I‚Äôd be curious to hear about your experiences.",zwolfe13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15e125k/8_red_flags_to_notice_and_consider_when_dating/,1690762741.0,0.5

"Situationship or Healthy Development ? There's this weird space I haven't seen many talk about. 

When youve been love bombed by every man in your life because you've picked unhealthy partners- healthy, slow relationship development feels unsure and makes me anxious.

I've been seeing a man for about 2 months. We typically meet up once a week. We are having incredible sex at this point and exclusive without a title.

We both discussed upfront that we are slow to attach and had limited free time but he said he would put in the effort to see where this goes and I agreed to the same. 

The problem is that when we are together- typically on his days off we have an incredible time. It really feels great. I've noticed things slowly developing into something more. But, the in between we barely talk. If I text him he does NOW respond quickly (he didn't a few weeks ago) and  our conversations have sustenance. He works nights and so usually when he's awake, I'm asleep and that also complicates things. He said I can text him whenever I want but that he doesn't like the dynamics of texting and would rather get to know someone in person. He is also not active on social media. 

How do you know what is actually a situationship vs a healthy developing relationship? I understand that we complicated things with sex. I promised myself after my divorce if I felt sexually attracted to someone I would act on it. 

Unfortunately now I'm here, wondering what the heck we are. 

Any advice? Is this where I make a decision or discuss it? We HAVE discussed these things in a casual way.

"How long before trying again after a short relationship ends? My (29F) boyfriend (29M) of a few months broke up with me last week. It felt very much out of the blue. Basically he came back from a family trip saying that he didn't feel a spark anymore and that we were good but not ""great.""

I cried for a few days and now I'm just really frustrated by the abruptness and lack of communication. I feel like I don't miss him anymore just the idea of what we could have had.

I kinda just want to jump right back into dating apps to see what is out there. As a woman who really wants to have marriage and kids in my future, I feel like I do not have time on my side.

"Online Dating as a Hyperfixation I've had many, many issues with not sounding desparate while dating online. Or at least, that's how people characterize it. And I've never understood that sentiment. Yes, I want my person. I want to stop looking. I don't *want* to project confidence at someone, I want to feel *safe* with them (I've posted about this before). I want someone to inhabit a home with me, by choice, for the rest of my life. This is my ideal state. I thought that's what most people wanted. Why be coy?

I've always characterized this need as an imperative. But this is a terrible way of explaining things, so I've been thinking of other ways to express how I feel. And last night I found the word for it: hyperfixation.

To anyone unfamiliar with the term, do you know what a mosquito bite feels like? It itches incessantly. You *need* to scratch it. And it's a little fun to do, at first, because you get that endorphin rush of quelling the itch. But then it gets bothersome. The bite gets bigger, and sore, and they often come in waves. And even when it's over, just when you're ready to do something else? You go outside, or a mosquito gets in your house, and it bites you again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have several hyperfixations, almost all of which are stupid. Some are active, while others are passive. I actively hyperfixate on things like, for example, Sonic the Hedgehog (and now you understand why I'm still a virgin). The Sonic franchise is *big*. Lots of games, cartoons, comics, etc., many of which are not in continuity with one another. And I get it in my head to gather art, or design pixel art, to visually express a headcanon. And in theory this is fine. Except that the headcanon never really works. Too many pieces don't fit together. Redundancies exist between continuities. Some characters would, hypothetically, be off-limits in a story due to copyright reasons, and for reasons I could never explain to a rational human being it impacts which characters I use. So I spend hours to days on the Sonic Wiki gathering more and more data, all of which amounts to nothing when I get swept up in my next hyperfixation. It stimulates my mind, but it also burns me out.

A passive hyperfixation often gets paired with an active hyperfixation. Like, for example, rewatching old episodes of Atop the Fourth Wall. These days I hardly pay attention to the episodes, instead letting them play as background radiation. It feels like something between white noise and having company in the room with me.

Here's where this loops back around to online dating: I love stimulating conversation. It's my favorite part of any relationship. And I think that talking, as well as *planning* a relationship, is a form of hyperfixation for me. Because my instinct is to be the architect in any courtship. I feel like I need to be, since otherwise nothing will happen. And I get attached too quickly, without understanding what I want versus what the other person wants. Because I can't understand. I could *never* understand what anyone wants. All I do is fixate on a person, create a narrative in my head, and twist myself to fit that narrative. Or I burn out, and the whole thing falls apart. Actually it falls apart either way, since the approach I take online doesn't translate well *at all* to the real world. Turns out I like to talk, and most women I talk to want to be touched and told how pretty they are all the time. Which is fine, but isn't how I operate. Because that's not how my fixation works.

I think my end-goal is also a hyperfixation. I want someone to live with me. My perfect evening is for us to sit in the living room, maybe quietly, maybe while watching TV or reading, each doing our own thing. And that sounds cold, but to me it isn't. Because we resonate with one another. We are each other's white noise. Yeah, we'd still say pretty words, kiss, have sex, whatever, but those are bonuses. The goal is to just *be* together.

So when I hear people say I come off desperate, it's because I try to solve romantic needs the same way I solve my other needs. I get in over my head, overwork myself, obsess over minor details, and it *never turns off*. Unless I burn out, or the other person gets fed up. And I keep searching for the person who I can weave into my tapestry, because it's the only way I know how to function. I can't decouple this hyperfixation from the rest.

If at least one person reads this and understands, I'll feel as if I've achieved something. ",Wooden-Trip-8053,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dotvo/online_dating_as_a_hyperfixation/,1690732177.0,0.83
"Lack of Physical Attraction Pretty much what it says on the tin. I've been hanging out with this girl for roughly a month. We started talking earlier in the summer and dropped off for a while when I was taking care of some personal stuff. We've been on about 3ish dates now. Coffee date, movie date, and a concert, granted the concert was more that one of her friends fell out and she invited me to join her and the rest of her friends. I've enjoyed each date, and I've had a great time. We both laugh and seem to enjoy ourselves throughout. I do feel like I talk a bit too much, but even when I try and get her to talk a bit more it seems very difficult to get her to actually talk about herself. I'll be honest physically she's not my typical type, but she seems like a really genuine and kind person, and I guess I'm in a position of not wanting to cut things off before they have a chance, but I also don't want to string her along.

Every one has seemed more concerned with making sure they're polite and friendly and that they make me feel attractive and respected, but there's never an attempt at friendship (like hanging out or texting asking about my day or major life moments).

"Confused with my relationship with my friend?? So when I was 21 (F)  I had a massive crush on my guy friend and I asked him out. He rejected me saying that he was in university and wanted to focus on his studies.

I didn't take that personal and we stayed friends but I kept my distance, as I still had feelings for him. 

Fast forward to 5 years which is now. He finished university and immediately asked if we can have coffee to catch up as I hadn't seen him for a long time. During the coffee catch up,  the impression I got was that he was flirting with me, he was acting all nervous and blushing hard.

The problem is , I no longer find him sexually attractive like he isn't my type anymore.  Yes I had a crush 5 years ago but I guess I got used to seeing him as a ""friend"" . He is really sweet , and I'm not sure if im being unreasonable especially because my parents really like him too. 

Is my lack of attraction to him because he friendzoned me 5 years ago? Or is it something else?

"Guy and i are way too attached Tldr: Here's my dilemma. Guy and I are very close friends. We treat each other as confidantes and he said he trust me more than 100%. We live in different cities but the thing is I often go to his city because of a problem that I have..which lately is getting better because over time I'm healing although not totally healed.

Everytime I go to his city and is about to leave, he keeps asking when I'll come back or I'll be leaving for good and then proceeds to question his life and where he will retire. Once I said I'll be traveling to another country and he's like are you leaving me. 

When i left and told him i was in the airport, he got very emotional and told me he will miss me and he's praying for my safety. 

Then, finally he visited my city due to a common friend's event. He then asked me what my plans are and where would I really be whether I'll be in his city or in my city for good and he said I'm considering living in your city and I don't want that we might go in opposite directions. 

On top of this, we are extremely emotionally attached so my issue here is I'm not entirely sure of going to his city but he asked me again when I'll come back to his city, I did say I have plans of going few weeks from now. He proceeded to plan going somewhere with me. When we are apart, we totally miss the company. When we're together, we're the happiest.

It's just that it feels like we are so committed haha but I'm a bit pressured whether this is really going to be my plan because traveling is putting a dent to my finances. He also told me though that he is dating people. I'm not hurt but I just feel that there are strong emotions involved here both in my part and on his part and we don't act like these with people we are friends with.

So I'm totally stressed out with the level of committment this entails (having to see each other seems to be a need. He also told me he needs me because with me his guards are down)

After that I stayed for a bit trying to find an excuse to go and then i came up with the idea i said to him ill go to the shop to grab some snacks . And so i did i left and never went back .

"I'm taking my best friend of 10 years on a date this Friday. How can I escalate/impress her beyond what she already knows about me? We met at the start of high school and have always been close. I've had feelings for her off and on over the years and I know that she has as well. Probably less than me, but I'm also my own worst critic. Lately we've been talking much more than usual and it's been about things like what we want in life, what we find attractive in a partner, our goals for work/family/where we want to live, etc. I've always known we're similar (duh, that's why we're friends), but it's been eye-opening to have some of those more vulnerable conversations and realize how aligned we really are.  
  
For context, this is a distance situation. I see her several times per year since we have the same home-town. We could pretty easily increase that number, but we're about 5 hours away from each other. We'll both be home to see mutual friends next weekend and I'm taking her on a date. We've been out one-on-one many times before, but this is the first time it's been super intentionally called a date. We're going to a cinema club (mutual hobby) to see something lighthearted and will probably grab drinks afterward.  
  
I'm not nervous about what we'll talk about or if we'll have a good time; I know all of that will work out. What scares me is escalating beyond our friendship. I know I should tell her she looks beautiful, break the touch barrier, find a moment for a kiss, etc. I want those things too - she is beautiful and I'm excited for the chance to be intimate. I can't help but feel like I'm playing with fire though.  
  
Any advice on making those jumps from friends to more? Ladies who have dated or otherwise been intimate with someone they knew for many years prior, what did they start to do differently that changed your perspective on the relationship? Are there any boundaries you would place that are different from a first date with someone you've just met?

"So how much of a dealbreaker are older self harm scars from the past? So I have some scars that are pretty obvious on clothed parts of my body. My upper arm near my shoulder and on both thighs. So you can't see them normally, but someone I'd be intimate with would definitely notice them.

They're from 2021, during a period of extreme depression stemming from childhood trauma. But in the 2 years since, that has improved dramatically. Now I pass as a normal, well-adjusted person with some quirks. You wouldn't think I'd be at a point that low in my past. I still have minor depression, with the rare major depressive episode. But those are continually improving.

However, I feel like anyone who sees my scars will immediately be repulsed, and won't give me the benefit of the doubt that I'm better, and have greatly improved. They'll see it as a sign of a major personality flaw or psychiatric disorder that will always be with me.

This coupled with how I have no sexual and romantic experience makes me think I'm undateable (yeah, that's a real word...).

I was very late to the dating game, so sometimes I feel like I am a newbie to this. Besides that I have had a hard time expressing feelings and letting people come close to me both physically and emotionally. However, I have been in therapy for about 8 years and I have changed so much. I am very happy with where I am now, but when it comes to dating a lot of my insecurities which i have worked hard on still kind of creep back in. 

I just met a guy during a holiday which i felt a connection with and he asked me out after. I mean I want to trust my gut that he likes me because he gives of those vibes. But in the past a lot of times I thought guys liked me and eventually just dropped me (hence the situationship). This makes me even more careful then before and i am sooo scared to like someone and get hurt again. But at the same time I just want to be able to open up my heart and let someone in. 

I started freaking out again, thinking I might have read his signals wrong and he doesn't see me that way at all. While when I am with him I feel like he likes me. But now being home and having time to think, I am freaking out again... I just wish I could just stay calm and see what happens. But part of me doesn't even want to try again and get heartbroken all over... 

I do think we have a good vibe, but now that we might become something more than just friends. It feels like I don't know how to act anymore. I feel like I have a hard time being myself and I am stressing out about doing something wrong...

"Am I too much of a red flag now? I've (M49) never had much luck with women. As a teenager and in my twenties, I was overweight, shy and distinctly average-looking amongst my peers and I kind of had the confidence to date sapped from me.
 In my thirties, I lost a little weight, socialized more (went to Uni) gained a sense of confidence but again, outside of a few drunken hook-ups, I was again that guy that seemingly wasn't anyone's particular cup of tea.
In my forties, my career has progressed well, I've got a good group of friends and enjoy life. I made a concerted effort to date in my early forties through various OLD platforms but nothing happened. During this, admittedly, I wasn't in the best shape but my now ageing average looks and my inability to make a connection and dating inexperience, was again hamstringing me.
Now I'm approaching my 50th next year and although I'm pretty much at peace with probably never having a family, it would be still nice to find someone to share my life with. I'm doubling down my efforts to improve my weight and fitness, but I feel my non-existent relationship past has made me a walking red flag with women.

"39M Dating Profile Advice I am a 39-year old man looking to potentially start dating after my partner died 11 years ago. I am a tall (6'3""), fat (currently 300 lbs; am down 30 lbs and continuing to lose), bipolar (medicated), introverted, highly functioning autistic single father of a 16-year old trans girl. That is an enormous amount of baggage packed into one sentence, but I am also highly educated (masters degree), generally successful (6-figure salary, own my own home), and have been told I am friendly and caring, though I tend to overthink things.

With all of that being said, since I had met my partner at work many years ago by happenstance, I don't exactly know how to go about it. I figure Online Dating is a good place to start, which brings me to my real question:

If I am interested in dating, open to serious or casual relationships depending on the connection, how much baggage should I put in a profile? Height and weight are kind of no-brainers, as is my child (she is my first priority, but at 16 she doesn't really need a new mom) of course, but I am kind of torn on the rest. My bipolar disorder is under control with medication and I am very open when talking to people to let them know (when it might matter, coworkers, bosses, etc.) but there is the very real stigma surrounding it, and I don't want to blindside anyone. My autism could probably go without mentioning since I learned about it recently, but now that I know I also feel it would be wrong to not tell someone that might be interested in getting serious with me (maybe this would be a thing to leave out of a profile but bring up after a few dates?).

I guess I am looking for advice on balancing sufficient, honest disclosure vs. oversharing. ",Particular-Crab335,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dvvg1/39m_dating_profile_advice/,1690749706.0,1.0

"Having trouble maintaining my relationship Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year now. We loved each other but recently we‚Äôre having some problems at a tiring rate.

Things started to get difficult after I moved back with my mom after an unexpected chance of living together with my girlfriend for about 2 months, and my girl friend didn‚Äôt cope with my absence very well. She told me that she felt very down and cried a lot because she missed me. I comforted her that I missed her too and now it‚Äôs just a phase before we can officially live together.
After the first week she came up with the idea of getting a dog, I think that getting a dog might make her feel less lonely so I agree with her and we did went to get the dog together.

The first week after getting the dog, things does not seem to turn out well. She told me that this is a mistake and she couldn‚Äôt take care of the dog like she thought she can. I said to her that it‚Äôs normal for people to have cold feet after taking in a pet and I myself did feel the same way when I got my dog. And that she should take a try for the first month and if things does not get better we will find another foster home for the dog. Another week went by and everything seem to be brighter. She started getting used to taking care of the dog and she does not feel too down like when I moved out.

But then, the dog had scab. The scab has been before we took her in. My girl friend had spent a lot of money treating the dog condition. Now to think I was so stupid not telling her to contact the people that sold the dog to us, because we did contact them and they said they will cover the expense for us but we‚Äôve already paid for another facility. Currently the treatment does seem to work but too slow. Back when things got better, we had plan on taking some time for ourselves, but with the treatment got longer than expected, i‚Äôve told her she and I should wait in case of the larger expense. We had a fight, she said to me that she felt helpless that she cannot afford to do anything on her own without thinking to much like before she got the dog. I said that it‚Äôs normal that it does take a lot of money when someone first take care of a pet, not too mention that it is sick. She replied that she did understand but she just couldn‚Äôt wrap her head around the fact that now she cannot treat herself like before. Eventually she partly accepted the situation.

For my part, now with this continuous chain of poor choice, unlucky events and my many attempts to cheer her up just for things to drag her down even further depressed, I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do next because it broke my heart to see her like this and I don‚Äôt seem to help her feel better at all. And it also affected my life as I‚Äôm writing this at 3 in the morning because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about my relationship. I would be really appreciated if you guys could help me with some advice.

"Is it a good idea to break No Contact? (F20 &amp; M21) I want him back. We were a great couple, the reason we broke up was because of distance. (We were long distance, he broke up with me)
 He even admitted that he believes ‚Äúin true love‚Äù that ‚Äúif one day, weeks, months or years later we meet again at a better time‚Äù then we could try again. 

We didn‚Äôt talk for a week, until I texted him about a serious situation (I found out I was pregnant after the break up, and lost the baby the following week). The situation was the only reason we were in contact for two weeks, he was very supportive and inclusive despite not wanting the baby because of our financial standings and that fact that we weren‚Äôt together anymore. (I‚Äôm better now emotionally and physically) but during that time of communication my ex admitted that he started vaping weed carts again since he broke things off with me.

As his ex gf there‚Äôs really nothing i can do, I can‚Äôt force him to stop, as a friend, however, I only suggested that he should stop soon unless he wants to risk everything in his life like job and family relationships.

We both made a promise, he stops smoking, and I start taking care of myself emotionally.

We haven‚Äôt talked for a week and I‚Äôve been avoiding his stories, posting anything, I deleted most of my social media too. NO CONTACT basically.

And he texted today saying 
‚ÄúI haven't smoked since we last talked, I hope you kept your promise. I hope you're doing better bye‚Äù

I all I wanna tell him is that I‚Äôm proud of him and that I‚Äôm doing much better too, but I also don‚Äôt want to answer him because of no contact‚Ä¶(we still have our ‚Äúlove‚Äù background from insta)

Anyways long story short. I think I blew it. I am not sure if I said something or did something. But I have my theories. Maybe I should not have found an excuse to touch her hand. Maybe I should not have said things like how are we or does she see any red flags or overexplained things.

There was this one time where she said she wanted to skip dinner. I said it's alright but on the 3rd time she said sorry I said ""promise it's okay. Who am I to complain (laughing emoji).

All these bad things happened in 1 day. Maybe she got turned off by taking candid picture of her or I wasn't confident in my answers or she didn't like how I think. Or maybe it was my outfit she didn't like. All I know is all this thing I am saying happened in the last date. I should have been more mindful.

She said our personalities just didn't jive and no connection after was starting to ignore my good mornings and seem to not be interested in chatting anymore.

"The end of virtual love: online dating for half a year, but a liar Half a year ago, a boy named Jack added me as a fri

&amp;#x200B;

end on a social platform. We started chatting, and it all seemed wonderful. We have a lot in common and often talk for hours. Gradually, we care about each other and support each other. Jack is a person full of sunshine and positive energy, and I gradually began to rely on his existence.  
  
Over time, Jack told me he lived in a small town not too far from me. We decided to meet, and I went to the meeting place full of anticipation. However, when I arrived at my destination, I found that the world was not as beautiful as I expected.  
  
The boy Jack originally described was completely different, replaced by a ramshackle cabin. I started to feel flustered, but I went in resolutely. I found the room disorganized, with wine bottles everywhere and broken furniture. A dirty man appeared in front of me, he was not the gentle and caring Jack I expected.  
  
He smiled and said in broken language, ""Are you here to drive me away?"" I was uneasy, but still trying to understand the story in front of this man.  
  
He begins to tell about his past, a time when he was a wealthy businessman whose fortune gradually disappeared due to a series of unfortunate events. To a certain extent, he pinned his hopes on online fraud and was forced by life, but he also regretted what he had done. I immediately understood that this man was the Jack I knew. Although he was far from the image I expected, I still felt pity for him in my heart.  
  
Jack and I had a long chat that rainy afternoon. He honestly apologized to me, admitting that his false actions were motivated by feelings of desperation and deprivation. I can feel the deep remorse and self-blame in his heart.  
  
Even though Jack was more broken than he was before, I knew we had formed a special bond. I decided to forgive him and reach out to him when he needed help. I want him to find himself again, to rerealize his lost value from within.  
  
I worked with Jack through a long rebuilding phase, as he underwent career training, sought counseling, and worked to move beyond his past. We develop a whole new level of trust and understanding, sometimes even deeper than before.  
  
Virtual worlds are not always real, but real emotion can be found in these illusions too. Sometimes, people act falsely not only out of selfishness, but also out of inner emptiness and desperation. We should learn to be tolerant and understanding, so as to support others sincerely.  
  
It is not impossible for virtual love to become real, it just needs more tests and persistence. Of course, it does happen that you only meet after chatting online for half a year and find out that the other party is a liar, so it is also very important to be vigilant in online dating.

"We just had our 3rd date and I still feel confused as to whether she even likes me-- what do I do? I (F25) have been dating a woman (F25) for 3 weeks. We've been out with each other once each week. Our actual dates are pretty fun and I like her. The problem is that I'm not sure if she feels the same way at all. 

The main reasons are as follows: 

1. Her texting response times are glacial. Always within the day, but many hours later. If it were up to me, we'd be chatting a lot more, and that's even with the fact that I normally hate texting. I want to talk to her, and get to know her. Part of me wonders: am I just getting too attached too quickly, maybe these response times are normal? 

2.  I've been driving everything. I've planned and paid for all of our dates, which I'm delighted to do-- but combined with the first point, it overall feels like she wouldn't even notice if I just dropped off the face of the planet. She showed a bit of initiative by asking if I wanted to go to a museum with her this weekend, but she had a change of plans and we didn't go. 

3. She's been a bit more physically distant than I would like-- like we haven't even kissed yet and I haven't bothered asking because I feel like she wouldn't be comfortable with it. I feel like you should only ask to kiss if you're really feeling that mutual ""energy"" in the air-- but I'm just not getting that from her. She said she wants to go slow, and I totally understand and even prefer it. ""Going slow"" is a green flag to me. But in light of the above two points, it just feels like I'm getting strung along a bit. To be clear, I would never pressure her or even ask her to do anything physical. I'm waiting on her and I'd be happy to wait as long as she likes. I'm just listing this as a point because I feel that I'm overall getting no positive indication from her that she's into me. 

It just confuses me that she still seems to enjoy our dates (and agrees to more), even though she seems to show minimal interest in me outside of them. It's made me dislike her, honestly. So as a result, I've come to the conclusion that I should cease planning any further dates and stop trying to text her. (Although, being the drunk idiot that I was on our last date on Friday, I invited her to take my second ticket to an expensive upcoming concert ü§¶). My thinking is that if she basically doesn't take any initiative whatsoever within the next week, I'll take that as a rejection and move on. She could:

1. Initiate a text conversation with me.

2. Ask me out on a date.

3. y'know üëâüëà 

And if she does any of the above, it might not really mean that it'll work out, but I'll at least not call it quits completely by next Sunday.

"[Loneliness] Being unmarried or single for whole life Hey Folks, I will be turning 30 next year. Currently single and not planning to fall in love / get married. 

I have been into 3 long relationships - spanning more than 3 years each of them. 

For most of the life aspects it is normal, I don't feel any issue being single. I have a pretty busy schedule - job, workout, sleep, hobbies once in a while. I don't find issue in making myself busy. I enjoy myself.

The only thing that causes an itch in my heart is the feeling of loneliness. I feel there are lots of things you can not share with friends or close family members. There is a sense of completeness you get from another human only, someone you know who is always there, someone you can call and chat for any long, someone who you can spend as much time as possible.

"How do you know if someone is dating you for superficial reasons I broke up with my boyfriend because of some red flags at the time . I misinterpreted some things that he said , actually I don‚Äôt really know now and am having second thoughts. He seems to say things sometimes without thinking first . In my experience people usually tell you who they are if you listen enough however . One time he said ‚Äúmaybe women shouldn‚Äôt work because of their periods‚Äù and another time he said that ‚Äúsome people think that women shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to vote‚Äù. After talking to him about these things that he said and how they came off as extreme and misogynistic statements in 2023, he explained that he thinks that we still aren‚Äôt able to talk about how periods affect women and that women should be able to take time off work if their periods really affect them enough. He also clarified and said that there are some people who think that women should not have been given the right to vote because women are considered underprivileged still in our society they can be easily manipulated by political candidates even if the candidate isn‚Äôt a good candidate and isn‚Äôt going to help our country in general they will say they will help women‚Äôs rights and women will buy into it. He said that isn‚Äôt his belief that women shouldn‚Äôt have been given the right but that he understands where people who say this are coming from and doesn‚Äôt know what the answer is for women or minorities who are easily manipulated by these political candidates. So all of that makes sense and is a discussion that makes sense but the original statement he makes comes off as extreme right? 

I have given this guy the benefit of the doubt because I think we all can say extreme things and not exactly mean it. He told me I have said extreme things about men too or other topics and he doesn‚Äôt hold it against me. He cited that I at one point made a statement and said that I had said that a lot of men are sexual perforators . I think we were watching chris Hanson lol. I responded that might come off as extreme and can see how people would be put off by my statement but that statistics show that a lot of sexual assaults are under reported and even the statistics that are reported are high with 1 in 4 women being sexually assaulted in her life . In my own experience using dating apps and dating in general I have been sexually harassed or groped approximately 20 times in my life so I was also making this statement based on my experience. I don‚Äôt think that this statement comes off as hating all men or anything like that. I also don‚Äôt think it is comparable to his statements as I feel like in this time most men are a little more careful about saying such extreme statements since the difference is that women can fear men and men don‚Äôt experience that with women . I feel like he‚Äôs trying to flip the script to avoid accountability ?

Most recently after trying to be understanding of my boyfriends statements and getting back together he told me that he felt he needed to reach out to me again and get back together with me because I am the most beautiful woman he‚Äôs ever dated. I was really offended at this particular statement because all of my life I have experienced men lying about themselves, misrepresenting themselves , and lying about their intentions in order to date me because they think I‚Äôm attractive . I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want to be considered attractive but it is also a double edged sword in dating just like I‚Äôm sure rich guys have that double edged sword too. I said how this really offended me and my boyfriend apologized and said he says stupid things sometimes and how he obviously likes other things about me and then cited him stating these other things this way which can sound harsh . He does constantly compliment me on other things like my cooking skills, how we have amazing conversations, how he‚Äôs never met anyone like me that thinks the way I do and how we can talk about all kinds of topics , how I am really sweet, how I am health focused, and how smart I am . 

But this statement bothered me I guess because of my experiences of men lying and even making me think they really like me only to find out they like me primarily because they find me attractive and that is their main priority . I have so much more to offer than how I look and want someone who can appreciate those other things as much because someday I‚Äôm going to get old and wrinkly just like all of us , and there‚Äôs got to be more to a relationship than that . I would like to see it as a compliment I took the wrong way but idk. How do I know if my boyfriend just says dumb stupid shit sometimes ? How do I know that he really likes me for me primarily and not shallow stuff ?

"NBSB at 22 Hello everyone, I am F(22) about to graduate from Uni and start living my life as an adult soon. I won't say it's embarrassing but I don't have any experience in dating and never had been intimate with a guy because I focused solely on school. I didn't fancy putting a lot of effort to what I look like before and just lived off life as a student who works hard. However, these past three years I started paying attention to what I look like and invested greatly on myself. I'd say I love how it made me feel really because I think it made me confident and happy looking at myself in the mirror. It also made me feminine, which is another delight all in itself. I discovered I like being girly girly... wearing dresses, necklaces, and fancying make up too. I started getting a lot of compliments and admirers out of nowhere. I've never received them before in all honesty and it makes me warm hearing them. I'm not exactly lonely because I think I'm pretty established emotionally (being single all these years) but I wanted to enter the dating scene and try being with other people's company aside from myself now that I'm pretty fine with who I am. Now, I'm kind of traditional and don't want hook ups or any of the sort. I just want someone who's up for the long term and who wants to build a possible future with me. So this goes that I don't want someone who'll just play around. Now the real issue arises, am I likely to be taken advantage of because of my zero experience in dating? Do guys still want someone like me who might be ignorant to the ups and downs of a relationship as given to never experiencing one?

"Middle eastern men Middle eastern men

I recently started talking to a middle eastern man (im Italian) and we have a five year age gap im 30 he‚Äôs 35. But the weirdest thing just happened and I was wondering if I could get any insight into the situation. 

We were on FaceTime and when I hung up I said ‚Äòk bye‚Äô not in a sassy way that‚Äôs just how I always hang up the phone k bye! but right after I said that he was saying no! But I had already pressed end call. 

I get a text shortly after saying that when you hang up the phone u don‚Äôt say goodbye u say ciao see you later or talk later. He was dead serious.

Feedback on Approach - I feel shame for wanting sex early on. Hello everyone! My dilemma is that I used to date someone and be friendly and then usually wait till the 3rd date to push for sex. Then I started to realize that if sex isn‚Äôt communicated early on you could get stuck w women who want to wait till marriage. So now I am pretty straight forward with women and I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs being received or if I am being creepy? Is it ok to just want sex? I feel kind of weird being that way.

"Am I doomed? So, probably a fairly common query on here but here goes...

Years ago when I think I was at university this girl followed me on Instagram. I didn't follow her back as didn't know her but she's always been active in viewing my stories etc, kinda odd. Out the blue after like 10 years she messaged me and we got chatting, just friendly really. She then mentioned she was moving away for work and asked if I wanted to continue or meet before she went? I politely declined and said it wasn't really what I was after... (She just wanted to have some fun I think)
She then suggests I speak to her friend who she showed my photo to and said she recognised me from a dating app years ago and that she liked how I looked. 

I got speaking to her, seems really nice but is a little guarded ( won't give out socials) due to bad post experiences so we are chatting on Skype messages lmao. 

She is legit, really pretty, smart and interesting. Kind of out of my league I feel. I think she is fairly experienced in dating so probably isn't nervous.

I on the other hand have been single most my life with only a few times really putting myself out there but only when something falls in my lap really, kinda like this situation. Without trying to be cocky, I'd say I'm decent, I'm 6'5, look ok, in ok shape, good professional job and good chat when around people I know, bit of a softie.. All my mates and their wives can't understand why I'm single and try to set me up so they think I'm a catch for their friends enough to recommend... but when it comes to dating I just get kinda nervous, as if I'm going to talk Infront a crowd of 1000 people. So I've made it all this way kinda not doing much and just avoiding feeling uncomfortable. But I'm fully aware this is holding me back in life and I want to change it.

I really like this girl but just feel that when we meet my nerves will get the better of me and it will overshadow who I am and what she's grown to like and she'll end up bolting. We are planning to meet soon.

Anyone for any advice for me?",TakeTheLift,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/15dp3d1/am_i_doomed/,1690732851.0,1.0
"Should I confess to my long-distance friend of three years that I have feelings for him or just let it go? I really don't know what to do and I really need your honest advice. This is my first time writing here, never in my life I thought I would do this, but here I am. I've been reading stuff for a while and I enjoyed it. I am having second thoughts about confessing to my friend so I thought maybe I should ask for some advice. Backstory, we met online and we became good friends, you know we talked every week sometimes we call. Then I got into a relationship and surprisingly, we're still friends. My ex and I broke and it destroyed me so much and he was there. He's one of my support systems who helped me a lot during those times. I got back up again and now I'm happy with my life, still on that healing journey but I am better now. I denied to myself that I was having feelings for him for a lot of times because I thought maybe I just carried away because he's always there for me through ups and downs and maybe because he's giving me attention. As time passed by, my feelings were going deeper and now I'm sure. The thing is, he's in Europe and I am in Asia, we haven't met yet, but I know what I am feeling is real. I want to keep this friendship for this lifetime, that's how much I am grateful for our friendship. But now, I am afraid I might ruin it because of my feelings. üòî I don't know if I should keep it to myself forever because I feel like that's me lying to myself. 

He told me about his new co-worker and he told me he finds her pretty and nice. He said he doesn't like her nor have a crush on her. He's just curious about her and wants to know more. He wants to talk with her and see where it goes. It breaks my heart but I can't say anything. So, would it be selfish of me to confess to him now? I just want to confess so I won't hurt myself anymore because of regrets. I know there will be a possibility of him dating her, so maybe before that happens I will just try to confess so that I'll have peace of mind too. But, I am scared. I want to keep this friendship forever, but I am afraid that my feelings will ruin it. 

What should I do? I am desperately asking for help now. I am sorry, I hope you guys will have a nice day and thank you too!

"How do I make my wife love me again like she once did?part 2 First off, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commended on my first post and who gave me advice, I really appreciate it. It has only been a few hours since I posted but I thought I‚Äôd like to clarify a few things. I was considering couples therapy a lot and I did phone one of our local councillors who has a good reputation for situations like mine but unfortunately the prices that was put in place was way too much. I haven‚Äôt been able to work due to my physical health and I‚Äôm not in the right state of mind to work. I used to love working and I reminisce on the good old days where I used to deliver milk and fresh meats in and around my local area.

"My ex catfished me using Hinge after I broke up with him for cheating I found out my ex (35m) had been cheating on me (27F) with multiple women (including two other somewhat serious relationships) via my local city‚Äôs Are We Dating The Same Guy Facebook group. When I initially found out, I didn‚Äôt have the whole story, so I let him convince me that he had just made a one time mistake and took him back. 

A few weeks later when I caught him lying about being with another girl, I broke up with him again. After I had blocked him on literally every platform, including the dating apps when his profile would pop up, I thought he‚Äôd finally leave me alone. 

THEN I started talking to a guy on hinge and agreed to go on a date at a newer restaurant in town for dinner. When I showed up to the date, it was not the man from hinge who my friends and I had researched and found multiple socials (Insta, Linkden, address, etc) for, but instead was my ex sitting there waiting for me in the restaurant.
